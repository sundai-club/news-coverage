    "title": "Huginn: Create agents that monitor and act on your behalf",
    "text": "It&#x27;s fun to wake up to find a project that I started on the top of HN! These days, I&#x27;m no longer very involved with the day-to-day of the project.<p>Now that it&#x27;s no longer a young project, here are some musings about Huginn and responses to people&#x27;s comments in this thread, in no particular order.<p>I&#x27;ve found that Huginn excels as a scheduled web scraper with lightweight filtering. That&#x27;s what I use it for. On the other hand, while you can write custom code in it, Huginn is pretty poor at implementing any sort of complex logic, and is even worse at bidirectional syncing between systems, which is something people often want it to do, but for which it wasn&#x27;t designed.<p>If IFTTT or Zapier meet your needs, awesome! No need to run and monitor your own service. I personally choose to run Huginn on my own hardware in large part so that I&#x27;m comfortable giving it website cookies and passwords.<p>Some examples of what I use Huginn for these days:<p>- Watching Twitter in realtime for high standard deviation spikes in certain keywords, such as &quot;san francisco emergency&quot; or &quot;san francisco tsunami warning&quot;, which then sends me a push notification, or &quot;huginn open source&quot;, that goes to a digest email (and I imagine will trigger because of this thread).<p>- Watching Twitter for rare terms and sending me a digest of all tweets that match them. Also sending me all tweets from a few Twitter users who post rarely, but that I don&#x27;t want to miss.<p>- Scraping a number of rarely updated blogs that don&#x27;t have email newsletters and emailing me when they change. Some use RSS, most are just simple HTML scraping.<p>- Pulling deals from the frontpage and forums of slickdeals and craigslist and filtering them for certain keywords.<p>- Sending an early morning email if it&#x27;s going to rain today.<p>- Watching ebay for some rare items.<p>- Sending my wife and me an email on Saturday morning with local yardsales from craigslist.<p>- Watching the HN and producthunt front pages for certain keywords.<p>Basically, anytime I find myself checking a website more then a few times, I spend 20min making a Huginn Agent to do it for me.<p>I think one reason Huginn has worked well for me is that I don&#x27;t try to make it do too much. I use it for scraping data and gentle filtering, and that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s been super helpful for alerting me to interesting content for The Orbital Index, my current project, a weekly space-industry newsletter. (Last issue: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;orbitalindex.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019-12-10-Issue-42&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;orbitalindex.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019-12-10-Issue-42&#x2F;</a>) I&#x27;m excited to check this out, but I wanted to congratulate you on a truly excellent project name. Having spent many, many hours in naming struggles, I truly appreciate the perfection.<p>And for those unfamiliar, the (also amazingly named) historian Snori Sturluson explains: &quot;Two ravens sit on his (Odin’s) shoulders and whisper all the news which they see and hear into his ear; they are called Huginn and Muninn. He sends them out in the morning to fly around the whole world, and by breakfast they are back again. Thus, he finds out many new things and this is why he is called ‘raven-god’ (hrafnaguð).&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norse-mythology.org&#x2F;gods-and-creatures&#x2F;others&#x2F;hugin-and-munin&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norse-mythology.org&#x2F;gods-and-creatures&#x2F;others&#x2F;hugin-...</a> Norse Mythology by Neil Giaman is very good if you like such things.  The audio book is especially good as it is narrated by the author.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audible.com&#x2F;pd&#x2F;Norse-Mythology-Audiobook&#x2F;B01LWUJKQ7?qid=1576180316&amp;sr=1-1&amp;pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&amp;pf_rd_r=WTZG8ZN5CEQFDTSC6FAV&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audible.com&#x2F;pd&#x2F;Norse-Mythology-Audiobook&#x2F;B01LWUJ...</a> Can confirm just finished it on a 8 hr road trip last week.  Very entertaining,  found myself laughing out loud in the car at several points There is a lovely two player board game called Odin&#x27;s Ravens in which players acting as Muninn and Huginn race against each other by playing landscape cards. [1]<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware of the full details of the lore so thank you for bringing that up!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamegeek.com&#x2F;boardgame&#x2F;192074&#x2F;odins-ravens-second-edition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamegeek.com&#x2F;boardgame&#x2F;192074&#x2F;odins-ravens-seco...</a> Fittingly, Munin is a sorta-popular server monitoring tool: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;munin-monitoring.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;munin-monitoring.org</a> I actually thought the thread was about that. The Muninn&#x2F;Hugginn association is engraved in my brain. I blame EVE online. Eve Online is produced here in Iceland and much of the language and norse mythology is worked into the game. Eve online uses ISK, we use ISK here. Haha, I was wondering when someone would bring up EVE.<p>Huginn is a fun ship to fly.<p>o7 Sleipnir forever! Thanks, I&#x27;m glad someone appreciated it! :) ... except that the first thing I thought was, did the open source panorama stitching project got ... different?<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hugin.sourceforge.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hugin.sourceforge.net&#x2F;</a><p>I thought what a weird coincidence that they&#x27;d choose this very similar weird word ... but now that you point out it&#x27;s the name of one of Odin&#x27;s ravens, I guess it&#x27;s not quite as uncommon of a word. I get it about naming struggles. I built something to solve this, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;naminator.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;naminator.io</a> &gt;I personally choose to run Huginn on my own hardware in large part so that I&#x27;m comfortable giving it website cookies and passwords.<p>This, exactly and all of the above.<p>It really is a fantastic project and kudos to you for starting it. Little known fact: this project is used widely by journalists  who can&#x27;t code (at The New York Times, among others) to do a variety of tasks, like eg. monitoring web pages like Trump&#x27;s policy position, scraping press releases or filtering out very specific news alerts.<p>see Huginn for Newsrooms: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;albertsun.github.io&#x2F;huginn-newsroom-scenarios&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;albertsun.github.io&#x2F;huginn-newsroom-scenarios&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s been at least as useful as Yahoo! Pipes, and endlessly more reliable. Thanks a lot! Yes! Albert&#x27;s work using Huginn at the NYTimes (and contributing some changes back) was one of the big early successes for the project. Great to see you at the top of HN today tectonic! I&#x27;m at Pivotal in Sydney Australia now. Thanks again for the impromptu interview all of those years ago! You, Sir, are why I read HN. It&#x27;s as simple as that. Firstly, thanks!<p>This has been immensely useful to me, and yes, my main uses have been primarily web scraping and then piping it into various channels.<p>Been running it on a cheapish VM for a couple years, very reliable and lets you monitor things more frequently and reliably than services like IFTTT. Nothing better than this kind of explanations to get convinced to try something, genuine passion seeps through your words.<p>You might just have fixed a couple of problems with your tool, thanks! What funny timing! I&#x27;m a fellow space-nerd and just signed up for your newsletter a couple of weeks ago — it&#x27;s fabulously done! Bravo. Love your newsletter! Brilliant writing and I think I click on more of its links than most of the many I receive. I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re enjoying it! Writing it weekly has been a great experience, and I&#x27;ve learned a ton about space science &amp; industry in the process. If possible, can you please compare it against Flogo <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tibcosoftware&#x2F;flogo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tibcosoftware&#x2F;flogo</a> ? Thank you for making Orbital Index! Super interesting and well written! Awesome project! Super impressive and will check out later Not just an alternative though.<p>- Self-hosted<p>- Unlimited and FREE vs $699 &#x2F; month<p>- Create your own agents &#x2F; integrations<p>- Process data through shell scripts or JavaScript<p>- Better filtering<p>- Liquid templating<p>- Completely private<p>I save thousands of dollars by using Huginn.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly powerful and quite frankly I don&#x27;t trust Zapier with my data and visibility of what I&#x27;m doing because there are commercial implications.<p>Run it in the cloud on AWS or on an old box at home.<p>It&#x27;s very reliable. Not disputing any of the other alternatives, but you can create custom integrations on Zapier. It&#x27;s mostly intended for publishing them publicly, but you don&#x27;t have to.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.zapier.com&#x2F;partners&#x2F;lifecycle-planning\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.zapier.com&#x2F;partners&#x2F;lifecycle-planning</a> &gt; I save thousands of dollars by using Huginn.<p>Does that take into account the overhead of operating Huginn? Yes, and it&#x27;s running thousands of requests and posts &#x2F; minute on AWS.  But you don&#x27;t even need to put it in the cloud, it runs perfectly at home on an old box running Ubuntu. That&#x27;s awesome that it&#x27;s working so well for you :) You can deploy it as a docker image in a few minutes. If you already run a homelab of any sort (which most of HN does), it&#x27;s basically free. &gt;  If you already run a homelab of any sort (which most of HN does)<p>You sure about that? I feel like there are plenty of folks on here whose only computer is a MacBook I have one box acting as a router, NAS, DVB-T receiver, NAS and the other box as HTPC. Both are based on desktop motherboards and I also run Kubernetes (kubeadm) on them, with more CPU-intensive tasks assigned to non-HTPC so it doesn&#x27;t interrupt movie playback. But yes, I think it is not common, it takes time to set up and maintain. I&#x27;ve run Huginn on a MacBook.<p>It works fine, along with a whole bunch of other stuff in Docker. I have been running huginn on my home server for a while. I&#x27;ve mainly used it to filter RSS feeds and then generate new feeds with the filtered items. Another use-case for me is ingesting webcomic RSS feeds (or scrape a page) and post the comics to a private Telegram channel. Once I also had an agent scraping a page and notifying me if something changed (realestate listing).<p>I have tried a couple alternatives, e.g. node-red but none really worked the way I wanted them to for these cases. huginn is incredibly flexible and (at least for me) the mental model of it&#x27;s workflow makes a lot of sense.\nSadly more and more pages want you to go through their app&#x2F;site and make it a bit difficult to work with, e.g. getting content from an instagram account.<p>One thing I have not figured out about huginn and which all of these automation tools seem to lack are loops. E.g I have page an agent scrapes, from which I want to output the src of an image tag but I also want to check if a certain condition on the page matches (e.g. a &quot;next page&quot; button exists) and then firstly output the found src but then also re-invoke the agent with a new input element. So it would scrape the next page and so on until it does not find the button anymore. &gt; One thing I have not figured out about huginn and which all of these automation tools seem to lack are loops.<p>I do some very complex stuff using the &quot;Shell Command Agent&quot;. You might want to look into using that if you haven&#x27;t already.<p>You can also create your own agent gem <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;huginn&#x2F;huginn_agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;huginn&#x2F;huginn_agent</a> You could perhaps use a tool like scrapy in combination with huginn. Scrapy has very simple patterns for doing that kind of logic. Yeah I just use the Javascript agent for v complex stuff like this. Oh, how could I have missed the JS Agent... thanks a lot for the hint! \nBut it looks like it&#x27;s not node, so no npm modules and other node APIs. That&#x27;s correct. You could shell-out to node with the Shell Command Agent though. Zapier has exponentially more integrations than this or anything else, but is surprisingly difficult to use, and more so since they updated their UI. Editing Zaps is pure torture because refresh is so difficult. Exception handling is pure pain. In most instances the breadth of API calls is so narrow, and so rarely updated by vendors that you end up switching to a custom integration. I&#x27;ve also noticed vendors rapidly expanding their native integrations, sidestepping the need for a request broker.<p>The &quot;retail&quot; integration space remains underserved and if one of the enterprise players decided to go down-market with a better UI and deeper integrations - they&#x27;d mop the floor clean in 18 months. &gt; The &quot;retail&quot; integration space remains underserved and if one of the enterprise players decided to go down-market with a better UI and deeper integrations - they&#x27;d mop the floor clean in 18 months.<p>I think it&#x27;s a tough market to be &quot;winner&quot; of. Novices are going to want a stupid simple GUI (&quot;wizard mode&quot;, as someone else in thread mentioned). Power users are going to want to be able to toss in some code at some point in a workflow to do some fancy ETL you don&#x27;t support out of the box. When you hit a certain level of complexity, an edge case or integration an automation product doesn&#x27;t support, or perhaps even an amount of spend that you start looking at annually as painful, it&#x27;s likely you consider pulling all of your workflows out and have a software engineer build something bespoke for your business line. Yeah, I wonder if this space is sort of like the to-do&#x2F;task-management space. It&#x27;s conceptually one thing, but in practice people have such different needs that no one product  can be everything to everybody. &gt; The &quot;retail&quot; integration space remains underserved<p>This is accurate, there&#x27;s a significant opportunity in this space but it won&#x27;t stay that way for long.<p>There&#x27;s a well-known entrepreneur I know with significant exits and capital entering this space that&#x27;s going after Zapier&#x27;s market and I&#x27;m certain he&#x27;s not alone. &gt; There&#x27;s a well-known entrepreneur I know with significant exits and capital entering this space that&#x27;s going after Zapier&#x27;s market and I&#x27;m certain he&#x27;s not alone.<p>Having seen how the sausage is made and what it takes to build and support such a product, I will say that past success is no guarantee of success in this market. It is a grind, day and day out of dealing with queues, API integrations that fail or degrade either loudly or silently and you have no visibility into them, non-technical users who are are not happy when the magic isn&#x27;t working, blobs of data that just shouldn&#x27;t be, spending hours tracking down single edge cases or failures, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;write some code, here&#x27;s your $1B exit&quot; (but you will be writing <i>a lot</i> of code!). It is constant tending of a complex piece of machinery, and failures are painful (outages somewhat, data loss exceptionally so). I totally agree, it&#x27;s not easy at all.<p>Anyone attempting to take on this space is going to have their hands more than full and they&#x27;re far more likely to fail than succeed.<p>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t even try, mostly because the tools themselves can enable much easier more likely to succeed lower hanging fruit and that&#x27;s how I use them.<p>If you want to make money &quot;using&quot; these tools then Huginn is your best option and it gives you a competitive advantage over those you&#x27;re competing with that are using Zapier to do similar things. He should make this effort a marketplace like zapier but let the finance side come from SAAS that let them offer the opportunity to share revenue through a resellers agreement. For customers in zapiers model this would mean zapier would be for free solong there is a resellers agreement in place. This would decouple the adaptation friction on using the service and for zapier this would bundle every SAAS contract on their infrastructure. Even Google offers resellers of SAAS GSuite a whopping 20% revenue share. Zapier can sell equity for an insane valuation IMHO. Money isn&#x27;t their problem I think. I think - may be wrong - the problem is management. My sense is they are hampered by prior success bias and lack of what I&#x27;ll call &quot;grey hair&quot; experience that provides insight into the business case their &quot;retail&quot; customers face. Again might be wrong, but something suggests arrogance to me. We tend to agree re: retail integration, assuming you mean among retailers as opposed to message brokering. &quot;Once a day, ask 5 people for a funny cat photo; send the results to 5 more people to be rated; send the top-rated photo to 5 people for a funny caption; send to 5 final people to rate for funniest caption; finally, post the best captioned photo on my blog.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m still laughing :) wth! (My fear is that this might actually be sustainable with ads.) This is basically the plan of The New Yorker, but with (probably) 1000s of people. Can you elaborate? If you don&#x27;t follow this, you are in for quite a treat. Enjoy:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;cartoons&#x2F;contest#finalists\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;cartoons&#x2F;contest#finalists</a> For about a week a few years back, I ran a twitter bot that did essentially this for tweets powered by mechanical turk.<p>I enjoyed waking up every morning to an often strange political message posted by my &quot;bot&quot;.<p>@CrowdWisdomBot if anyone is curious :)<p>Doing it with cat photos is far more clever. I agree, that was an eye-opener example For a more business-friendly-but-still-FOSS approach to task automation between services, see also Apache Airflow: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airflow.apache.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airflow.apache.org</a><p>Airflow has been a skill that many companies ask for (especially data engineering), but surprisingly doesn&#x27;t have many articles written about it. The Airflow landing page that you linked to lists many integrations but when you click on those only a small subset of them are listed in the integrations section of the docs that is  linked to. I guess the docs are in need of some more work. It&#x27;s easier to look at the APIs:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airflow.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;_api&#x2F;airflow&#x2F;operators&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airflow.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;_api&#x2F;airflow&#x2F;operator...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airflow.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;_api&#x2F;airflow&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;operators&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airflow.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;_api&#x2F;airflow&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;...</a> This, as well as related projects like n8n &amp; node-red, is a very cool project. I always wonder what people use it for in real life though. It seems a lot of trouble (setting up, learning curve, maintaining) for an action that usually takes a couple of seconds, like checking the weather or opening twitter.<p>Does anybody have useful workflows going on? &gt; checking the weather<p>I actually use Huginn to check the weather, compare it with weather conditions for the previous two days and send the result to my Telegram as a simple text (&quot;It should be a bit warmer than yesterday in the first half of the day&quot;).<p>I do this because I have a hard time understanding if wearing a coat would be enough for &#x27;-5 deg. Celsium, NW wind 30 kmph&#x27;. Comparison with previous days helps a lot since I already know that I was feeling ok in my coat yesterday. Ever notice when someone criticizes a company on HN, and suddenly the CEO shows up and engages after 6 months of inactivity? Likely they are using a tool like this along with Google Alerts, etc, to monitor sites for mentions of the company and maybe flag negative sentiment. Also, same thing but for politics. Yes, very interesting indeed! Either there is a big conspiracy to uncover or said CEO reads HN and if something is number 1 and is related to his product he pays close attention. We will maybe never find out the truth... From your defensive tone it sounds like you think I was talking about you, but I really wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a phenomenon I&#x27;ve observed here and on Reddit and elsewhere for many years. And it seems like a perfect fit for a tool such as yours, is it not? Very sorry! As I was the only &quot;CEO&quot; in here which product got criticized I thought it must have been me ;-)<p>Yes would actually be perfect for it, but never had the time to set something like that up. Maybe someday in the future. For now, I only have a simple Google Alert set and regularly check HN and Google Analytics which is a good indicator when it got mentioned somewhere. &gt; As I was the only &quot;CEO&quot; in here which product got criticized I thought it must have been me ;-)<p>I don&#x27;t think so. I do use node-red in real life.<p>Basically for two things: \n- Transform rss feeds into instant messages (this way I receive new comics I follow on my phone for example)<p>- Create simple bots<p>This way I avoid creating scripts every time and managing a new webserver and stuff, all my small scripts are in one place. I have a few: \n- watch GoFundMe campaigns and post funding updates on Telegram\n- watch multiple tech blogs and post updates on Telegram\n- watch multiple funny blogs (xkcd, monkeyuser, lightroast, daily wtf) and post updates on Telegram\n- watch English idiom&#x2F;word&#x2F;phrase of the day feeds and post on Telegram\n - watch Canada&#x27;s Express Entry draws and post new draws on Telegram\n- watch IELTS exam dates&#x2F;locations&#x2F;seat availability and post updates on Telegram<p>These have required some setup but little to no maintenance after. There is also ActiveWorkflow[1], which targets business users and let&#x27;s you write custom agents in any programming language[2].<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;automaticmode&#x2F;active_workflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;automaticmode&#x2F;active_workflow</a>\n2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;automaticmode&#x2F;active_workflow&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote_agent_api.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;automaticmode&#x2F;active_workflow&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master...</a> Huh, I did not know about this fork of Huginn. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tines.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tines.io</a> (security automation platform) might also be based on (or inspired by) Huginn added to bookmarks. Thanks for sharing!\nIt&#x27;s always good to have alternatives For those using expensive&#x2F;advanced connectors like Zapier, Tray.io, etc. I find that <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;n8n.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;n8n.io</a> serves as a far welcoming open-source alternative that is worth looking at. Thanks a lot rvz for throwing it in the mix. I am the creator of n8n so just wanted to mention that it is not &quot;OSI approved open-source&quot; as the commons clause got attached. More information about that in the FAQ <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.n8n.io&#x2F;#&#x2F;faq?id=license\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.n8n.io&#x2F;#&#x2F;faq?id=license</a> Nice project. A low-code focus like Zenaton (another Zapier alternative) would be great. You end up a bit OSI-traumatized after the n8n launch? ;) haha, no would have done that even without that. It was always important to me to make that clear even though it did obviously not work exactly like intended. This is nowhere near as robust as Zapier and has significant limitations. n8n does also have way fewer integrations.<p>About the &quot;robust&quot; part. A startup I know had a lot of issues with Zapier and switched to n8n and are quite happy as they did not have any issues since. I am sure you are right and you did your research but would love to hear what exactly you are referring to as it will help me to improve n8n.\nThe same with the limitations. Anything specific? Have you considered generating integrations pragmatically using OpenAPI? Yes, I did but did not get to it yet. Also not sure if this integrations would then be the &quot;best&quot; to use. I think it would be great to have at least &quot;something&quot; if nothing exists yet but would not be as good and easy as regular integrations and so would not fit perfectly into n8n as I really want to have it as easy as possible for users. Nowhere near as flexible and powerful as Huginn. Please elaborate. I&#x27;m not questioning what you say is true, but I&#x27;m interested in a tool like this one and would love to know more before choosing one or another. Do not have that much experience with Huginn but you are probably right. As n8n is new and Huginn is already around for many years it would be surprising if they would be equal in every way.\nAnyway, I am quite sure that most that can be done with Huginn can with a limited amount of work also be done in n8n as creating new nodes is very simple.\n(I am the creator of n8n) Something I&#x27;m not entirely clear on:<p>One use case for Zapier (from a developer&#x2F;company standpoint) is to allow customers to connect their existing services to actions inside your own app. For instance, if a customer updates a CRM record, you can have a custom zap update a record in your own SaaS platform.<p>To pull that off with huginn, is that as simple as connecting this up to Singer.io? Or would that require a big marketplace of huginn agents for popular integrations? If you like this kind of stuff, you might find my patchbay project interesting:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patchbay.pub&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patchbay.pub&#x2F;</a> Also checkout Node Red [0], it&#x27;s fairly popular in the automation space. It&#x27;s rather sparse by default, but after adding in some community nodes (or making some yourself) it&#x27;s pretty useful.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodered.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodered.org&#x2F;</a> I imagine things have changed, but I tried node-red maybe 3 years ago, and found it really difficult to setup and get working.<p>Once I finally had it working, I found it really difficult to debug &quot;tasks&quot; (I forget the correct, node-red verbiage), for example to find out why an HTTP call was failing.<p>I also found the available connectors to be lacking, and a lot I tried were quite basic. I gave this a go today and managed to install huginn on my synology nas by simply searching for the docker container. I then setup 3 agents to scrape a Shopify webstore jason endpoint that I’m always checking for inventory, have huginn parse the json and send me an sms via twilio if inventory changes. Took about 2 hours, wasn’t too bad. Huginn twilio docs seemed dated.<p>Used python simplehttp server and ngrok to replicate a json url and play with the triggers to test it all before pointing it at a real website.<p>Nice to add a new tool to the belt, thanks!

It was a surprise to see Hugin get top billing on HN other than for awesome panoramic image stitching. I see that this particular horse was already beaten in 2013: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5377815\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5377815</a> also not to be confused with Hugging - I&#x27;ve seen the word &quot;rake&quot;, so I guess... is this written in Ruby? If so, how&#x27;s the performance?<p>My home server is pretty minimal and lightweight: a Raspberry Pi. Do you think it will run it fine? (I&#x27;m gonna want to try this anyway, didn&#x27;t know about it until now and it looks amazing!) A fresh Huginn container idles at ~300MB of memory without any configuration on my part. A fresh node-red container idles at 30MB. I was unable to run the Huginn Docker container on my Pi, I assume because there are x86 binaries in it. I&#x27;m trying the manual install now... Yeah, there&#x27;s only a x86 Docker image on Docker Hub for Huginn. You could probably just build an ARM image from whatever Dockerfile the x86 version was built from. Performance is good, memory requirements could be lower though. It should run fine with 1GB of RAM, possibly less. I’m glad Huginn is on the front page. It’s an awesome project being used for a long time now. I was testing Huginn to see how skimpy I can be and still run Huginn on a free tier. Was able to run it on open shift free tier a while ago when their allowance was generous. But, looks like it’s hard now. Will try running on a Gcp instance and see if it works. Is there any way to implement agents in python rather than JavaScript&#x2F;ruby?  Looks interesting but I don’t want to invest energy in building fluency in these other scripting languages. I run Huginn in a Kubernetes cluster with most of its heavy lifting done by HTTP calls to OpenFaaS running in the same cluster. This let me write complex logic in Python but have Huginn handle the execution, triggers, filtering, and delivery of the data. Among other things I use it to scrape Twitter for interesting Kubernetes news and follow the retweets back to people who link to their own websites so that our editorial department can vet them for invitation into our writing program. Any particular author&#x2F;account only appears once. It generates around 40 new candidates each day. I also use it to scrape the Chilean public alert website (onemi.cl) for alerts in my region ( forest fire, major weather), run those through the translate API and then send the English translations to my and my wife’s phones via Pushover.<p>These are things that I want to control and customize, and I vastly prefer running my own systems over trusting any third party. Not exactly.<p>You could write python externally (cloud functions&#x2F;aws lambda) and then use huginn to call that over HTTP. This doesn&#x27;t require any coding. Huginn has existing agents that you can easily configure to make HTTP requests (PostAgent and WebsiteAgent).<p>And, depending what you are planning to do with huginn, simply sending data from your python script to huginn using the WebhookAgent may be sufficient.

You should try it out. Interesting, I should switch to that for some location-based action with my phone instead of IFTTT and see if I can make it work with Hauk or something similar.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bilde2910&#x2F;Hauk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bilde2910&#x2F;Hauk</a><p>Disclaimer: I have no link with the Hauk project, just found about it by browsing the F-Droid store.

Does anyone know of one that would allow me to read Tweets and post ones containing some particular text to a Facebook page (not my personal timeline&#x2F;page but one I created for my project)? This looks worth checking out but I’d love to see a Lambda version of it Yes, that would be the killer feature Related idea that was on HN a few days ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nileshtrivedi&#x2F;6024434121b073789e6d580eb84c3ea2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nileshtrivedi&#x2F;6024434121b073789e6d58...</a> what would be your preferred way of scheduling lambdas and doing storage? I use HTTP cloud functions (google&#x2F;firebase version of aws lambda).<p>Firebase database for long term persistence.<p>Huginn for scheduling and event based triggers of those cloud functions. It&#x27;s not quite 1:1 but not a bad comparison.<p>I like to think of Zapier as &quot;wizard mode&quot; - if you&#x27;re doing something within their pattern, planned workflow, capabilities, etc it is a <i>great</i> option.<p>If you need to do something more advanced or outside that narrow scope, you need to go to the APIs (or Huginn) itself.<p>The important questions are: How many people need to get into advanced mode? How big of an effort&#x2F;skill&#x2F;understanding jump is it to go there? (aka will it hurt too much to switch?) I&#x27;ve come across Huginn many times in the past and every time, I tell myself I&#x27;m going to give it a shot. I still haven&#x27;t even seen it loaded in a web browser...<p>After fighting the Docker images for half an hour, I usually realize that I could&#x27;ve just written a Python script to do whatever I was trying to do by then and proceed to do just that.<p>Sorry for being lazy! Maybe I&#x27;ll get around to it next year... How well does it support:<p>- support remote agents and remote reporting?<p>- dead-man triggers for missing reports?<p>- is remote reporting properly secured? (encrypted&#x2F;signed) What do you mean remote agents? Can it be accessed over HTTP? Then yes.<p>One of the great features of huginn is the diagram. That&#x27;s where there are green and red indicators. Red indicates both errors and when a longer than expected period has passed. This makes quickly inspecting your workflows easy. &gt; What do you mean remote agents?<p>Sorry. I meant running an agent on a machine that is separate from the machine running huginn. The machine running the agent is not accessible publicly but has internet access (doesn&#x27;t accept connections but can initiate them). huginn would be accessible publicly. Ok, so in the remote agent:<p>Retrieving data from huginn can be done with the DataOutputAgent.<p>Sending data to huginn can be achieved through the WebhookAgent. I&#x27;m probably missing something here, but what is the value of this when you could write a script that would do just about the same? (Serious question, I want to know the answer, not rhetorical) Huginn is more of a framework for writing and running these scripts. It has some built in modules to make the process easier. IE: The webhook agent is an easy want of getting POST data into a script without bootstrapping a webserver yourself, you can then just raise an event and have another script handle it. No need to write and manage everything individually, you can run everything in one place. Yes, and this becomes exceedingly important as the number and complexity of automations increases.<p>Huginn can assist in organizing complex workflows into manageable components. I&#x27;ve deployed Huginn a few times but never gotten off the ground with it. I found agents a bit too cumbersome to configure, but maybe I just need to give it another shot. How does this not have a companion technology called Muninn? I would not market this as an alternative to Zapier since it goes after a different market. The type of people who use Zapier will see a link to github.com and not even consider it.<p>I think this should be positioned more like &quot;A high powered Zapier for technical users&quot; or something similar. &quot;Self-hosted&quot; is a growing buzzword these days (for many good reasons, IMHO). It really sounds like Son of Anthon from the last season of Silicon Valley. I don&#x27;t see a list of all supported agents or a way to search.

Mostly assisting in curating news about niche technologies (angular, react).<p>What&#x27;s a &quot;major issue&quot;?<p>At this point, I feel that I&#x27;m well versed in when to use huginn. That helps me avoid most issues.<p>I use Zapier all the time for the things it does better&#x2F;easier. That said, often, one end of the &quot;zap&quot; is integrated with a workflow in huginn. For instance, I commonly use Zapier when I need data gathered by huginn to be continuously logged into a spreadsheet.<p>Additionally, puppeteer(node) is another fantastic automation tool, which I use to do things that you probably shouldn&#x27;t try to do with huginn. But, I connect my puppeteer scripts to larger workflows using huginn.<p>Thanks to the maintainers, I think that huginn does what it was designed to do very well. One of the current maintainers here, which installation method are you using and how is it working for you? @dsander I immediately recognized your username from GitHub Thanks for all the work you&#x27;ve put in!<p>I run Huginn on Heroku. I haven&#x27;t had any significant issues since it&#x27;s been running. It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve set it up that I would need to review my notes to tell you any more about how it&#x27;s deployed. What did you have for breakfast? I don&#x27;t eat breakfast. What about second breakfast? Sometimes a smoothie around 3pm that contains plant proteins, collagen protein, amazing grass, 1&#x2F;4 cup of blueberries, ground chia seeds, and maca powder.<p>I&#x27;ve been intermittent fasting + keto for the majority of the past five years.

    "text": "Over Thanksgiving I shot a gun for the first time.  An AR15 and a Glock.  The AR was fun to shoot.  Kind of nerve-wracking holding a weapon that could kill someone but fun none the less.<p>The Glock was another story.  It kicked like crazy and you could really feel the power of each shot in your arms.  I didn&#x27;t have any fun shooting it and I was a more than a little terrified I was going to hurt someone.  Even when it was empty I had so much unease just setting it down on the table.<p>Seeing those police officers enter someones home with their guns drawn and pointed was... a new feeling.  I had an immense sense of dread just knowing how much power was behind those guns.  The thought that someone was pointing it at children is just beyond my comprehension now.  For what?  Allegedly logging into a website?<p>If shes guilty, go to jail, pay the fine, whatever.  But the level of escalation to even walk through the front door with your gun drawn.  The level of... I don&#x27;t know... disrespect?  Hatred?  I can&#x27;t even begin to describe to someone who doesn&#x27;t know just how much force and how casually its being shown.<p>Truly, these officers are a disgrace to Florida.  The people who trained them are a disgrace.  And the people who empower them to behave this way are a disgrace. I had an identical first-time experience a few months ago. For some reason I was expecting the Glock to be way easier and less terrifying than the AR, but it wasn&#x27;t. It really blew my mind that I could aim directly at a human-sized target only 6 feet away and <i>totally miss.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t the first thing they tell you about guns something like &quot;don&#x27;t point it at anything you don&#x27;t intend to destroy&quot;? How does a trained officer hear that two children are in the house and not immediately de-escalate? This is insanity. &gt; How does a trained officer hear that two children are in the house and not immediately de-escalate?<p>Unfortunately the police shoot kids fairly routinely, as lawyer Greg Doucette shows in this twitter thread.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;greg_doucette&#x2F;status&#x2F;1336132653481865217\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;greg_doucette&#x2F;status&#x2F;1336132653481865217</a> After reading through the linked thread I&#x27;m taken aback by the sheer number of deaths that don&#x27;t seem to get any kind of coverage in the national press (and that&#x27;s only for people accidentally shot as the police were trying to kill their pet).<p>Considering the sheer number of killings, this can and really should be reported in much a similar way to a protracted war, as it does look very much to be an extended attack upon civilians by an armed forces of sorts. Some cops receive training that teaches them to escalate.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;warrior-cop-class-dave-grossman-killology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;warrior-cop-clas...</a> bigyikes says &gt;&quot;It really blew my mind that I could aim directly at a human-sized target only 6 feet away and totally miss.&quot;&lt;<p>No surprise. Even after years of training many, if not most, police officers miss close-up shots more often than they hit. There&#x27;s a surveillance video somewhere of a security guard and a perp shooting their firearms at each other from about 3 feet apart: they miss every shot. One had a revolver and the other a semi-automatic. It is somewhat reminiscent of the &quot;apartment scene&quot; in Pulp Fiction but even wilder and less believable:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y6YBKdmOlM8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y6YBKdmOlM8</a><p>Shooting a target at a range is very different from drawing and shooting at real people who are moving toward&#x2F;away from you, possibly with ill intent and possibly armed.<p>For police, entering a building with a search warrant is not something to be done with a firearm holstered. You have no idea what you&#x27;re up against in that situation. &gt; For police, entering a building with a search warrant is not something to be done with a firearm holstered. You have no idea what you&#x27;re up against in that situation.<p>This is a ridiculous rationalization that could be applied to literally anyone or anything. What&#x27;s interesting here is how much your experience is a bit counter to the actual power and destructive energy released by the two. You aren&#x27;t WRONG -- the pistol is way harder to shoot. But that hides a big delta.<p>Essentially zero handguns produce the kind of energy downrange that an AR-15 produces.<p>You feel more recoil with a pistol, sure, but that&#x27;s misleading in the extreme.<p>Because I am a giant nerd (I mean, look where I&#x27;m posting) I have a folder full of Excel docs I created to collate information to compare it for my own amusement. One of those is about ballistics.<p>An AR is almost always chambered in 5.56x45mm, a NATO standard caliber. The actual projectile in a 5.56 round is super super small -- like, 62 grams. But there&#x27;s a LOT of powder behind it, so it delivers on the order of 1800 J.<p>Glocks are most often in 9mm, which is the most popular handgun round in the world. The actual bullet for 9mm is about TWICE as massive, but has so much less powder, and so much less barrel to spin up, that its downrange energy is typically less than 500J -- ie, like 28% of the AR.<p>But the Glock will buck in your hand, for sure. It takes training and practice to be able to hit the target reliably over and over.<p>An AR, though, is insanely stable for lots of reasons -- obviously, it&#x27;s heavier than the pistol, but that&#x27;s not all of it. There&#x27;s some clever design involved. But the end result is a gun that most any trainable person can learn to shoot accurately very, very quickly. The marriage of 5.56 and the AR platform creates a weapon that&#x27;s really insanely good at rapid, accurate fire.<p>This made it very successful as a military rifle, and makes it a serious terror in the hands of someone bent on bad acts. For physics nerds: momentum is mv, kinetic energy is 1&#x2F;2mv^2.  Upon firing, the chemical energy of the powder is converted to kinetic energy in the bullet.  When the bullet hits the target kinetic energy is converted to tissue damage.  More powder = more kinetic energy = more damage.  Heavier bullet = more momentum = more recoil.  That&#x27;s why the Glock has so much more kick, while the AR-15 has more penetrating power and range.  There are also pretty massive differences in the aerodynamics of the bullet, which probably helps the AR-15&#x27;s range a lot:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qph.fs.quoracdn.net&#x2F;main-qimg-ab7ec2e9df26a1afc268032e6ddd41ab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qph.fs.quoracdn.net&#x2F;main-qimg-ab7ec2e9df26a1afc26803...</a> &gt; Heavier bullet = more momentum = more recoil.<p>But if you have the same amount of powder (chemical energy) a heavier bullet will simply move slower, resulting in the same momentum and recoil.<p>What makes the AR-15 easier to handle is that the gun itself is heavier, so it moves slower from the recoil. That and a few other things like dissipating the energy over a large area on your shoulder instead of the palm of your hand. My understanding is that there&#x27;s also some clever gunsmithing involved to help reduce felt recoil there as well, but I&#x27;m not an authority in any way. 62 grams is a big hunk of metal, you probably mistyped &quot;grains&quot;? 62 grains is just ~4 grams. You are correct. I have both columns in my spreadsheet and misread.<p>5.56 is about 4 grams, or 62 gr.<p>9mm is about twice that: 7.5 grams or 115 gr. I mean, you&#x27;re talking about how you went shooting deadly firearms for fun on a family holiday, and then express disbelief that police would enter a suspects house with firearms drawn.<p>I&#x27;m not american but it seems pretty obvious to me why american police are trigger happy while in most other countries they are far less so. &gt; I&#x27;m not american but it seems pretty obvious to me why american police are trigger happy while in most other countries they are far less so.<p>Can not be access to guns, I live in Switzerland and &#x27;we&#x27; shoot a lot. Have a lot of firearms at home too. Yet our cops are all but trigger happy. So the reason must be another that what I think you are implying? It seems pretty obvious to me that the police act partly according to how they were trained, and partly according to the esprit de corps and culture that has developed over time.<p>I agree with you and think it’s an extreme oversimplification to say that higher rate of gun ownership would lead to a more violent police force. Like the military, they are a tool that will behave and act according to the implicit and explicit expectations placed upon them from different sides. Speaking of training and the military, the best trained personnel (Special Forces) are the ones least likely to pull the trigger. They are trained to hold back until they cannot anymore, and they are confident in their abilities. Very different from regular police. Even though the SF personnel are faced with situations far more dangerous. Which makes complete sense - they have more training and experience and thus are more confident in their own ability to keep cool in a difficult situation and make split-second decisions, rather than what seems like low-level cops being scared to death and reactionary in their encounters. Whatever the reason for this pattern of behaviour, it&#x27;s a disgusting outcome. &gt; t seems pretty obvious to me that the police act partly according to how they were trained,<p>Not doing so is grounds for dismissal in a lot of precincts.  It&#x27;s why we hear stories of officers doing the ostensibly &quot;right&quot; thing by not killing a suspect, yet face dismissal.  The department training guidelines dictate a use of deadly force in a scenario, and not doing so is seen as risking the lives of officers.<p>This is the hill American need to climb to reduce the likelihood of death and serious injury by police.  There is a lot of judicial precedent supporting such policies as part of policing guidelines, so it is very unlikely the change will come from the courts.  Instead, citizens will need to work at a local level to shift training and policy towards de-escalation. I don’t live in the US or Switzerland, but my guess is that in Switzerland, there is almost zero chance, statistically, for the police officer to be shot by suspect. In my country, I haven’t ever heard about police officer being shot, and coincidentally, I’ve never heard about a suspect being shot by the police unless it’s some kind of counter terrorist operation or something. The behavior of American police behavior cannot be explained by the number that have been shot. That number has been trending downwards over the last few decades:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_American_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_American_police_office...</a><p>Regardless, the current actions in question were inexcusable even if police incorrectly believe they are in increasing danger in general. They simply had no reason to be brandishing firearms in this specific case. It’s not about the number of officers being shot per se. I’m not trying to defend the US police. But I think it’s about the danger of the encounter. In my country, police don’t encounter suspects who are a) under the drug influence, b) very likely to be carrying a weapon and c) very likely to use that weapon. So here they are trained accordingly and police don’t shoot at suspects. In the US, it’s very different. My friend was once robbed by armed criminals in Los Angeles, which would be unthinkable where I live. So I guess the police in the US is trained to respond to such encounters because they have to. And the downward trend might be due various reasons, including aforementioned training that prevents police officer from being shot in the first place. It’s all just my guess, of course. You&#x27;re saying a lot here so it&#x27;s a bit tough to respond specifically. But my point is the following: the danger police has decreased hence any talk of increased danger is certainly wrong. There may be a _perceived_ increase in danger, but that&#x27;s not the same thing.<p>It seems pretty clear (to me) to be cultural. Not cultural in some static sense (e.g. American vs Swiss), but cultural as in the culture of policing in the US has been changing over time. Our police has treated American citizens as more dangerous while the opposite is true. The real question is why. Why have Americans idea of the level of crime in society so diverged from reality? Can this be reversed? I want to agree with you, but the US is the only 1-st world country in the top of the list of countries by homicide rate per capita:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indexmundi.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;VC.IHR.PSRC.P5&#x2F;rankings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indexmundi.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;VC.IHR.PSRC.P5&#x2F;r...</a><p>Which pretty much is in line with what I get about US through my news feed and anecdotally.<p>I don&#x27;t know why, but there is definitely something wrong with US culture of normalized violence. And the police is just a reflection of that, reaction if you will. Perhaps it&#x27;s all about training and the culture of  &quot;killology&quot; that&#x27;s seeping into our police forces [1].<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that corporations pay police to &quot;protect and serve&quot; them instead of the general public [2].<p>Or it&#x27;s the &quot;perceived&quot; danger from the cops&#x27; point of view?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insider.com&#x2F;bulletproof-dave-grossman-police-trainer-teaching-officers-how-to-kill-2020-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insider.com&#x2F;bulletproof-dave-grossman-police-tra...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;readsludge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;corporate-backers-of-the-blue-how-corporations-bankroll-u-s-police-foundations&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;readsludge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;corporate-backers-of-the-b...</a> &gt; &quot;In my country&quot;\n&gt; &quot;In the US, it&#x27;s very different&quot;<p>If I had a dollar for every time someone on HN who doesn&#x27;t live in the US nonetheless weighs in as an expert on American life I could retire.<p>Do you think a data scientist who had ethical concerns about covid data manipulation is a violent murderer? Do you think America in real life is like a movie with gun fights and explosions?<p>There is essentially zero risk of someone shooting a cop in a routine situation. They weren&#x27;t raiding some druglord gang headquarters or ISIS terrorist operation. Again, in my country criminals don’t carry guns and unlikely to be under drug influence = zero police shootings. Vs your country, where criminals do carry guns = lots of police shootings. No need to be American to connect the dots. Honestly, being a cop is probably no more &#x27;dangerous&#x27; than walking into any business establishment and getting blown away by an insane person.<p>I used to deliver pizza&#x27;s back in the 90s, I never would&#x27;ve thought my job was top 5 for deaths, and cops were &gt; 18th, but those are the statistics. It is mostly lack of&#x2F;improper training combined with fear. Switzerland is a much smaller and safer country than the USA, people Europe would come up with much better comparisons if they compared the USA to the whole of Europe rather than their particular niche. Switzerland has very different regulations, practices, and policies related to guns than America. Although gun ownership in Switzerland is high for a developed country it is still a fraction of what it is in America.<p>Switzerland and America are like chalk and cheese when it comes to gun ownership. The trigger happiness of cops is unrelated to our rate of firearm ownership. In fact the percentage of American homes that own any firearm has been on the decline for decades, while cops have gotten much more aggressive and militarized. Having guns is a necessary but not sufficient condition.<p>You need to have guns and a mixture of distrust and&#x2F;or fear of the government. There&#x27;s a difference between target shooting and threatening someone with a gun, just like there&#x27;s a difference between pentesting an OWASP training VM and actively deploying ransomeware at a hospital. it seems the parent post is about a first time ever hands on experience with firearms, and realization its not like TV. I&#x27;m glad you find it easy to characterize 330 million people as the same person. That&#x27;s in no way fair or realistic. It&#x27;s like saying all Europeans are the same. That does not mean you should be pointing a gun at some one unless you intend to kill them. this is why Absolutly NO ONE should be immune from the consequences of thier actions, and in a situation of authoritative power should be even more accountable than others, not less accountable Unfortunately this is not the case in the US thanks to qualified immunity... Two out of the three times in my life that I&#x27;ve had a gun pointed at me, it was the cops! Having had a gun pointed to you at all three times in your life is an absolutely terrifying statistic to me. Incredibly common here.<p>I was a teenage passenger in a car when a friend of mine held up his wallet in the light of the back window to see if he had his bank card or w&#x2F;e. Cop car was behind us in traffic, pulls us over, and two cops get out guns drawn instructing everyone to get face down on the pavement.<p>Turns out they thought they saw a knife&#x2F;gun when my friend had held us wallet up in the light, and they figured we were brandishing a weapon at them. We all got searched and when they found half of us <i>Boy Scouts</i> were carrying pocket knives things got really stupid really fast. We had to beg them to be rational with us, nose down on the pavement. Seriously I think the only thing that saved us was two of us had our Eagle cards...<p>This is anecdotal in rural small-town Iowa... but having lived this sorta stuff first-hand you realize that it&#x27;s not uncommon to have been harassed at gunpoint by the police. The only times I&#x27;ve ever had guns pointed at me were by the cops. The way you wrote your comment seems to imply you prefer criminals to point a gun at you Yea - criminals typically have more repercussions to their actions where-as a cop has lots of protection behind them. Usually the worst-case scenario for a cop pulling the trigger is a boring early retirement with one heck of a pension.<p>I&#x27;d rather be mugged at gunpoint vs. held at gunpoint by a cop any day of the week due to game theory alone. If that is your preference, I think you are living in the wrong country. The AR15 is shooting a much more potent round than the glock. It just is more fun to shoot because it is about 5-6x as heavy as the glock and your shoulder is a much stouter backrest than your wrists. I think the word you are looking for is indifference Ms Jones own take &quot;They claimed it was about a security breach.  This was DeSantis. He sent the gestapo.&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem far off. How about we let the facts come out in a court of law before calling someone you’ve never met a “disgrace”? Are you under the impression that unless something is both illegal, and produced enough evidence to be convicted in court, it cannot be disgraceful? There&#x27;s no possibility of a world where the police do disgraceful things legally, let alone disgraceful illegal things and get away with it? No. You read an awful lot into that. Then please, enlighten me as to what exactly is stopping anyone from calling these people disgraceful until it ends up in court, particularly considering the fact that the video isn&#x27;t especially ambiguous as to what happened. In fact, how is &quot;a court of law&quot; at all relevant to the matter of their being disgraceful? &gt; Seeing those police officers enter someones home with their guns drawn and pointed was... a new feeling.<p>Is this not the culture in the US? Is it new cause they are doing it to someone white? No it’s not. This isn’t how arrests or searches are usually made. Even in extreme cases, officers don’t usually use more force than necessary.<p>Source: I’ve been arrested for murder. &gt; Source: I’ve been arrested for murder.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some interesting backstories here on HN over the years but this was a brand new one for me I think ..!<p>I assume they figured out you were innocent since you are here commenting about it and I also assume you won&#x27;t talk about it so I won&#x27;t <i>ask</i> but I will say I am intrigued. Yeah - it was a weird situation. My wife - who was pregnant- received a phone call that a close relative had died.<p>The guy had been a living off the grid. A nice guy who was into green living, etc. He was retired with a good pension and savings, so decided to build his “eco cabin” in the middle of nowhere and he self reliant via renewables.<p>Sadly, living in the middle of nowhere means a reduction in time to arrival for emergency medical support.<p>He had a stroke.<p>The details were a bit gruesome: walking for miles seeking help before freezing to death. Scavengers arrived quickly.<p>My wife got the phone call. The cousin she spoke with emphasized the gory details.<p>My wife responded loudly and with emotion.Screaming, wailing, crying, etc.<p>She wanted to go the impromptu funeral they were having. Apparently he’d wanted to be buried at his cabin. No service, just have his friends dig a hole and throw him in.<p>Perfectly legal in that state, as long as death was reported.<p>She’s need the car - which means I would have to walk to work. In the winter. With images of a man I knew dying from hypothermia fresh in my head.<p>I said no, unless she can find her own transportation.<p>Buses don’t go to the middle of nowhere.<p>We had a bit of a shouting match.<p>Anyway she said she’s going to the funeral and basically stormed out the door. She didn’t take the car.<p>Apparently neighbors overheard. They heard my wife’s blood curtling scream, and also heard about our plan to “bury a body in the middle of nowhere.”<p>My wife was pregnant, which substantially increases a woman’s risk of being murdered by the father.<p>And she was gone.<p>I wasn’t certain what state the uncle’s cabin was in, much less county or municipality.<p>I wasn’t certain how my wife planned getting there.<p>My wife had a smartphone but didn’t take it with her (not as odd back then).<p>There were other incriminating things- bloody clothes, lots of used menstrual pads (wife is pregnant - does he have a mistress?), there had been several shootings in my apartment building. Etc.<p>The police arrived in a very agitated state. They were certain I killed my wife. They asked questions I probably shouldn’t have answered:<p>“Where is your wife? Where’s the body?”<p>“I don’t know where she is, but the body’s in the middle of woods somewhere”.<p>“Your wife is in the middle of the woods?”<p>“Not yet, but she will be.”<p>You get the drift.<p>I was arrested and sent to the police station to be interrogated.<p>I spent a lot of time waiting around, and very little time being interrogated.<p>I got be treated like a murderer for the length of time it took my wife to borrow a car and drive 400 miles - when she checked in with family.<p>Not a fun 12 hours.<p>It’s worth pointing out we were broke and living in a high crime neighborhood. There had been three shootings in that apartment complex that year. Thanks!<p>Hope your life is better now! Honestly it wasn’t terrible back then. We were just poor. Could be worse. &gt;&gt;more force than necessary.<p>&quot;Necessary&quot; is a very subjective term, and many people disagree on what is &quot;necessary.&quot;<p>For example I do not believe it is &quot;necessary&quot; to assume with out cause or evidence that every warrant enforcement will be a violent encounter the requires a military style response like we see here<p>Sure if you are going after a known violent criminal that committed a violent act (like murder). however IMO These types of tactics are not &quot;necessary&quot; in cases like the one we have here it is not the norm in the US involving nonviolent crime regardless of skin color. My first sentence explains why it was a new feeling. They do it to blacks and whites just about as much as each other. You don&#x27;t hear about the random people much, just the special cases that are suitable for the news. Don&#x27;t mistake press coverage for the actual distribution. Black people are killed at much higher rates (2-3x). Anything that says otherwise is usually trying to finagle the numbers by basically claiming that Black people have more encounters with the police so it&#x27;s only natural. But that would imply that police have no say in who they stop and why. There&#x27;s an important detail missing from your abbreviated account and that is the individual refused to open the door for the warrant and apparently used the time to &#x27;alter&#x27; her situation.<p>So it&#x27;s not as if the police just came in like a swat team off the bat.<p>America is a dangerous place, and just like you&#x27;re a &#x27;regular person at the range with an AR and a Glock&#x27; - guns are everywhere.<p>The &#x27;normal&#x27; situation for police to be serving a warrant would be against people accused of things more physically  nefarious, and it&#x27;s probably very ingrained SOP to have weapons drawn if the individual wouldn&#x27;t open the door and some degree of aggression needed to be used to enter the premises to serve the warrant.<p>That they had their &#x27;guns out of holsters&#x27; is actually perfectly reasonable because systematically, it&#x27;s too dangerous for them otherwise.<p>That said - this was a warrant for a white collar&#x2F;non-violent crime and there&#x27;s just no excuse for pointing guns at kids, or even the former employee frankly.<p>Point being, we can&#x27;t cherry-pick just the things that don&#x27;t sound nice, and entirely decontextualise.<p>If there weren&#x27;t 500 million guns, many of them high-powered floating around out there - and Americans didn&#x27;t have a propensity for shooting at cops (the level of assertion people show when being arrested in the US is way more than in other nations, car chases barely ever happen in my home country) - then the SOP (standard operating procedures) would be very different. Cops are chill where I&#x27;m from - t least in part - because they just don&#x27;t face aggression or violence in a way that is really threatening. Fights, yes, guns in their faces, almost unheard of.<p>Given the possibly political nature of the arrest, I think it probably needs to be reviewed by the local Justice Department as well because &#x27;gun pointing aside&#x27; - the other Elephant in the room is the issue of whistleblower harassment etc.. &gt; America is a dangerous place, and just like you&#x27;re a &#x27;regular person at the range with an AR and a Glock&#x27; - guns are everywhere.<p>You are more likely to be violently attacked working at a convenience store than being a cop. But we would not tolerate it if the guy next to the slim jims pointed a gun at every random customer. Citizens that choose to carry a weapon for self-defense cannot point their weapon a people just in case, or even put their hand on their weapon or flash it to other people, that is called brandishing and is a crime. Yet police do it as a normal part of their interactions. This idea that police should be allowed threaten and intimidate other citizens as a normal part of their job because “its so dangerous” is ridiculous.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s probably very ingrained SOP to have weapons drawn<p>Then this is a failure of their training or a failure of the individual police. Hand waving police having deadly weapons drawn and pointed at fellow citizens because of habit is not acceptable.<p>&gt; That they had their &#x27;guns out of holsters&#x27; is actually perfectly reasonable because systematically, it&#x27;s too dangerous for them otherwise.<p>First, it is not too dangerous. Second, if it is, then pick a new line of work. If you are too scared to do your job correctly and would rather put citizens at increased risk then join the post office. And maybe, just maybe, a policy of shoving guns in people’s faces <i>is what escalates many of these situations</i>. &quot;You are more likely to be violently attacked working at a convenience store than being a cop.&quot;<p>You are absolutely more likely to be shot at while serving a warrant, than working in a convenience store.<p>&quot;Citizens that choose to carry a weapon for self-defense cannot point their weapon a people just in case&quot;<p>Citizens are not police officers, entrusted to carry out the law and who must <i>actively</i> confront danger, moreover, police are trained to do so.<p>&quot;Then this is a failure of their training or a failure of the individual police.&quot;<p>This is wrong to the extent that it&#x27;s very rational for police to at least have weapons drawn when individuals are refusing to comply with the warrant etc.. &#x27;Weapons drawn&#x27; is a very simple tactic, which makes them easy to use <i>if</i> necessary. It is not in and of itself particularly dangerous.<p>&quot;First, it is not too dangerous. &quot;<p>Yes it is. [1] (from the AP, not Fox News) Have a little Google yourself.<p>&quot; Second, if it is, then pick a new line of work&quot;<p>This is a shameful remark, exemplary of the general tone here. &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to get COVID and die - quit being a nurse - now go ahead and work without a mask!&quot;. It&#x27;s absurd (and basically offensive) to suggest that public servants shouldn&#x27;t have the right to take appropriate steps to defend themselves, or even have to put themselves in a position of danger, let alone harassment in the first place.<p>Even African American Police officers are called the n-word and put up with all sorts of horrible abuses (just search &#x27;police&#x27; on TikTok) which should definitely be illegal: you cannot go into the DMV or IRS (or Wallmart!) and start harassing people - the same should apply to police.<p>If the woman in question was concerned for the safety of her children, she would have simply opened the door and &#x27;used her words&#x27;.<p>If in fact, the Gov. is illegally intimidating her, and she&#x27;s done no wrong, well then I hope the judge recognizes that.<p>Finally, police reform is not going to come form the plebes on social media, it&#x27;s going to have to be done thoughtfully, by them, led probably by ex-police officers who have first-hand experience.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;30fd23e66f21446b90d2b8cb0135ae03\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;30fd23e66f21446b90d2b8cb0135ae03</a> &gt; &quot;You are more likely to be violently attacked working at a convenience store than being a cop.&quot;<p>&gt; You are absolutely more likely to be shot at while serving a warrant, than working in a convenience store.<p>Do either of you have statistics?<p>&gt; Yes it is. [1] (from the AP, not Fox News) Have a little Google yourself.<p>Serving a search warrant on a statistician who blew the whistle on corruption is nowhere near the same situation as serving a search warrant on drug dealers. Come the fuck on. 1) The article clearly makes a distinction between the types of warrants.<p>Serving warrants in general dangerous, point blank - and even &#x27;white collar criminals&#x27; who don&#x27;t answer the door are giving indication that something may be up.<p>It&#x27;s 100% reasonable for the police to have their weapons upholstered at that point and well within reasonable SOP.<p>2) There&#x27;s no evidence of corruption on behalf of the officials in Florida - this is the continued misrepresentation of some in the press, and  easy echo-chamber populism.<p>There as an argument over how data should be represented; disagreeing with your employer is not &#x27;whistleblowing&#x27;.<p>Again - Florida releases considerably more detailed information than they do in any province in Canada and somehow, everyone seems to think that we are doing &#x27;such a great job in governance&#x27;.<p>The overall level of wilful ignorance on these nuanced incidents in shameful. Even so-called smart people believe what their emotional triggers and biases want them to believe.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing what the courts have to say about it. I think this story might be the case study I use to open a discussion about news bias with my 66 year old father. We live in FL and I had a brief discussion with him sometime during the summer about our state&#x27;s pandemic response. He mentioned something about the governor trying to hide data, and I was like “...huh?” and after hearing this story today I connected the dots. &gt; You are absolutely more likely to be shot at while serving a warrant, than working in a convenience store.<p>Over 600 convenience store workers are murdered on the job per year [1] compared to about 60 per year for police [2], about 5-7 of which are during serving warrants (additionally backed by your own source). Convenience store workers are murdered at about 7 per 100k, while police are about 7-8 per 100k [3]. As for how dangerous it is, there are more than 60,000 “no knock raid” search warrants per year in the US [4] and there is no way of knowing how many 10s of thousands of regular warrants are served as well. Saying that serving warrants is “inherently dangerous” because people <i>could</i> become violent is like saying working at a convenience store is inherently dangerous because any customer <i>could</i> be a violent robber.<p>&gt; This is a shameful remark, exemplary of the general tone here. &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to get COVID and die - quit being a nurse - now go ahead and work without a mask!&quot;. It&#x27;s absurd (and basically offensive) to suggest that public servants shouldn&#x27;t have the right to take appropriate steps to defend themselves, or even have to put themselves in a position of danger, let alone harassment in the first place.<p>Well, wearing a mask doesn’t put others at greater risk. If police want to wear body armor, great. If police want to put other people in danger by excessive weapons use, then no that is not ok. Everyone is allowed to defend themselves against an attacker. Police want to defend themselves anyone that <i>could be an attacker</i>, which is not ok. I am all for providing safety equipment and training to all jobs. I am not ok with compromising the safety of others for the safety, perceived or otherwise, of the police.<p>This twisting of the concept of defending yourself is exactly the problem. Police already carry guns, multiple less lethal weapons, body armor, etc. If they are attacked, they have multiple ways of stopping the threat, including deadly force. No one has made any claim otherwise. But police want to be able to brandish their weapons and point their weapons at other people that have not shown themselves to be a threat, because there is the <i>possibility</i> of a threat and the misguided idea that imagined threats justify real threats by the police against other citizens.<p>My tone is one of outrage that police brandishing or even drawing their weapons against unarmed fellow citizens is just seen as normal and acceptable. That police being allowed to see every person as a potential threat and to treat them that way is the standard. Having your hand on your weapon is a threat. Having a weapon drawn is a threat. Pointing your weapon at someone else is a threat. Police threatening unarmed people is not acceptable.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;mlr&#x2F;cwc&#x2F;assaults-and-violent-acts-in-the-private-retail-trade-sector-20032008.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;mlr&#x2F;cwc&#x2F;assaults-and-violent-acts-i...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;pressrel&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;fbi-releases-2019-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-in-the-line-of-duty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;pressrel&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;fbi-release...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;iif&#x2F;oshwc&#x2F;cfoi&#x2F;police-2018.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;iif&#x2F;oshwc&#x2F;cfoi&#x2F;police-2018.htm</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;politics&#x2F;the-war-on-drugs-gave-rise-to-no-knock-warrants-breonna-taylors-death-could-end-them\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;politics&#x2F;the-war-on-drugs-gave-...</a> &gt;There&#x27;s an important detail missing from your abbreviated account and that is the individual refused to open the door for the warrant and apparently used the time to &#x27;alter&#x27; her situation.<p>Proof?  This sounds an awful lot like something a police department who refused to publish video evidence themselves would make up out of thin air to save face. Why would the police want to release anything?<p>The press clearly misrepresented even the minor facts of the case (&#x27;pointed guns at children&#x27;) for which there isn&#x27;t any evidence - using that likely untruth as the headline item thereby making it an iron clad fact of &#x27;truth&#x27; in the public narrative.<p>It&#x27;s possible, even likely that 1) The woman did something actually wrong and used government accounts without permission and 2) she didn&#x27;t answer the door for 20 minutes, thereby requiring the police to take a more assertive posture. And frankly I doubt they pointed guns at children because that would be pointless. (Although it&#x27;s possible she is entirely innocent of breaking into said systems, and possibly has some entirely good reason why she didn&#x27;t answer the door for the police for 20 minutes)<p>If you use some public system in an unauthorized way, download data, you certainly would expect police to knock in the door, and you don&#x27;t answer it for 20 minutes, they might have their guns upholstered when you finally do. That&#x27;s not unreasonable.<p>Also, just because someone has a grievance with your company&#x2F;government, doesn&#x27;t them a whistleblower. In the entirety of her public foray, I&#x27;m not able to find the specific nature of her concerns - the more I look, the more I doubt her claims. Florida releases more data than any province here in Canada as I can tell, here is the Florida dashboard [1] here is the Ontario dashboard [2].<p>Florida release information specifically related to schools, LTC facilities etc. - Quebec has for example denied that data to the public.<p>I feel the entire case, like everything, has been politicized.<p>For reference From [3]: &quot;Plessinger said Jones refused to answer the door for 20 minutes and hung up on agents. Jones eventually let the agents into the home, she said.<p>Her family was upstairs when agents entered, Plessinger said.<p>The 31-second video Jones posted on Twitter shows agents entering her home with their guns drawn. Jones tells the officers that her husband and two children are upstairs as they direct her outside of the house.<p>One of the agents points his gun toward the stairwell. An officer shouts, “Police, come down now.”<p>As the video ends, Jones yells, “He just pointed a gun at my children.” The video does not show any children, or agents pointing guns at any children. FDLE said agents didn’t point guns at anyone.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;floridahealthcovid19.gov&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;floridahealthcovid19.gov&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publichealthontario.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;data-and-analysis&#x2F;infectious-disease&#x2F;covid-19-data-surveillance&#x2F;covid-19-data-tool\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publichealthontario.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;data-and-analysis&#x2F;infe...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower-search-warrant-20201207-rapzkgm7fnbujlhwzadunciigu-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower...</a> This FL resident supports your efforts to inform.

The judge issued a warrant in spite of evidence clearly saying she&#x27;s not guilty, and she&#x27;s dead now.<p>Judges routinely issue warrants just because the good ol police officer man says it&#x27;s totally ok and he&#x27;ll get a nice lollipop for doing it. As I understand it, the warrant for Taylor&#x27;s house had nothing to do with Taylor herself, but with another person believed to be using her house. Her guilt or innocence were never at issue. The issue is: the evidence they gathered was that her home was specifically NOT part of any drug rings. The judge went ahead and issued a warrant even though all actual evidence said her house was not involved. Cops lied and said it totally was, and the judge just said &quot;sure thing bros, we&#x27;re all such buds.&quot;<p>My point is just because a judge issues a warrant doesn&#x27;t actually mean anything at all. It has the same factual basis as me saying the sky is actually made of M&amp;M&#x27;s and judge granting a decree that it must be true because I said it. Aren&#x27;t magistrate judges supposed to take the police&#x27;s word for this? You can&#x27;t have an adversarial process for getting a search warrant. The remedy for broken warrants happens at trial, with motions to exclude evidence.<p>There was grave misconduct in the Taylor case! Police shouldn&#x27;t routinely be assaulting homes with weapons drawn. My issue is just the process you&#x27;re describing here. I&#x27;m mainly commenting on the way up parent here:<p>&quot;They got a warrant. Judges aren&#x27;t going to issue a warrant based on asking a bunch of people if they sent a message.&quot;<p>Judges absolutely issue warrants all the time just for the hell of it. The very up parent seems to be indicating that some sort of due process was done because &quot;oh, a judge issued a warrant&quot; and I&#x27;m emphatically stating: a judge issuing a warrant means as much as me saying the sky is made of M&amp;M&#x27;s - just the ravings of irrelevant madmen in the face of actual facts.<p>Edit: I will say - the warrant process should absolutely be adversarial. Justice is to be blind. Which means if a crackhead and a cop come to a judge and requests the legal authority to break into a home with lethal force, the judge should weigh both requests the same. That&#x27;s the intent of our legal system - the executive does what it thinks it&#x27;s supposed to do in light of what the legislative has passed, while the judicial watches them to make sure they don&#x27;t screw up.<p>Instead they all get together as buddies and stomp their collective boots into the skull of their fellow citizens. This isn&#x27;t realistic. Warrants occur relatively early in the investigative process and are often the first indication a target has that they&#x27;re under investigation. An adversarial warrant process would simply result in the destruction of most evidence.<p>A good way to prosecute your side of this argument would be to point out any country in the world that has an adversarial warrant system and how well it works. I&#x27;m unfamiliar with any. Much of Europe doesn&#x27;t even have the exclusionary rule, meaning that evidence of crimes obtained under false or broken warrants remain admissible.<p>If your argument is simply that most police shouldn&#x27;t be armed, you&#x27;ll get no argument from me. To my knowledge, much of the rest of the developed world doesn&#x27;t have a problem with cops being able to lie under oath with no punishment. The non-adversarial systems you reference rely on the confidence that when a cop gets caught knowingly lying to get a warrant, that cop is fucked. Here in the US, it&#x27;s just another Tuesday morning at the coffee shop with the boys.<p>On the destruction of evidence, this one has always baffled me - so is there evidence or not? Presumably when I go to a judge saying I need the legal authority to kill some babies at 3 AM because otherwise the evidence will be destroyed... I have enough evidence to justify killing those babies, right?<p>... So this begs the question... Why do I need authorization to kill babies at 3 AM? In case the suspects destroy more evidence? What was my evidence to kill babies to begin with? Just a hunch? Because a judge should absolutely shit on that, and it should be adversarial. A judge should laugh when evidence for a warrant request is &quot;oh, I need the warrant because they&#x27;ll destroy the evidence for me to request this warrant.&quot;<p>From my rough observation of the news for the past 20 or so years, the evidence of these crimes these babies died to protect has never been worth it. Maybe you know of a few where the death of a few babies were worth it because the crimes were so heinous. Every time I&#x27;m aware of - it&#x27;s just been drugs, which could have been done in daylight hours, with no dead babies.<p>Now maybe this is your point about unarmed police. I&#x27;m not sure. But a warrant tends to be a fuck ton of latitude (as I&#x27;ve said in prior comments - judges just hand them out like candy), so just send in cops who want to kill with their bare hands and you&#x27;ll get the same result, in my opinion.<p>I agree I&#x27;m being extreme, but that&#x27;s where we are today. We tried the whole &quot;let&#x27;s just all get along and try to fight crime together&quot; method, and it turns out cops will just lie to judges and go kill kids. This isn&#x27;t me doing a slippery slope &quot;what if&quot; scenario. This has already happened. A bunch of times. Too many times in my opinion.<p>So now it&#x27;s time for us to take away everyone&#x27;s toys until they can show us they can all be good. I don&#x27;t really understand how this is a response to what I said. I pointed out that much of Europe doesn&#x27;t even have the exclusionary rule: that if the police obtain evidence through misconduct, prosecutors are allowed to use it at trial. You responded with 6 paragraphs about killing babies.<p>Be specific. What country has better rules regarding warrants than the US? This should be easy, because it seems hard to believe that we could be the best country in the world at this process. Then we can go look at how that country handles things, in specifics, and learn something. Honestly, I&#x27;ve typed out a few replies, and I&#x27;ve got nothing.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m saying I don&#x27;t trust cops because they kill 1,100 people a year. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s my whole argument. Just 1,100 lives. Every year.<p>You&#x27;re saying that&#x27;s not relevant to what we&#x27;re talking about and let&#x27;s look at how European countries seem fine with their more lax evidentiary protocols, legal systems, and trusting cops. Even though their cops only kill 50 people a year (at equivalent population rates).<p>I really don&#x27;t have a &quot;better&quot; warrant system to propose other than an adversarial one because at the end of the day I don&#x27;t trust cops, and you&#x27;re advocating for a legal system that intrinsically does. This is me saying &quot;hey, blue is actually yellow&quot; and you saying &quot;no, blue is blue.&quot; Our perceived realities are too far apart. You haven&#x27;t proposed an adversarial system. That would involve details, or an example of some country or system that uses one, so we can get the details from there. It&#x27;s not interesting to simply wish that the warrant process was adversarial, because it doesn&#x27;t appear realistic to have such a system; you might just as well abolish investigations altogether.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in your feelings about the police killing people, because I share them, and there&#x27;s nothing for us to discuss about it.<p>I am interested in the provenance of warrants, because they&#x27;re central to the actual story we&#x27;re commenting on. I think that you&#x27;re both arguing a bit past each other. Fountainofage is stating that the situation as it stands is untenable and needs to change, and they&#x27;ve given several good reasons as to why. You are asking for examples of a direction for society&#x27;s legal systems to change to, to fix the problem.<p>Basically you both are in violent agreement, I think. No, we&#x27;re not. We agree that police barging into homes with guns drawn and shooting people is a problem. We violently disagree about the solution: I think we should disarm most police, eliminate qualified immunity, have states license police officers, and require police officers to carry insurance. &#x27;Fountainofage wants to eliminate search warrants. &gt; have states license police officers<p>I’m pretty sure this is the case in most if not all US jurisdictions. You have to pass police Academy and annual or at least somewhat regular proficiency, physical, and written tests to ensure you are competent.<p>It not like you can just get hired as a cop because you have a cop friend. <i>It is absolutely not the case.</i> You generally have to pass a competency test, and, having done that, your retention is a matter for your local police force and governed by its collective bargaining agreement. Some states can &quot;decertify&quot; police officers, mostly for committing a felony, which is a batshit standard.<p>The point of licensing is to bypass the CBA; the state can revoke a license --- for reasons other than &quot;failed an exam&quot; --- and having done so, the local department cannot retain the officer regardless of the results of labor arbitration.<p>This is something Illinois is working on right now, at the behest of the Lightfoot administration, though I haven&#x27;t seen much news on progress. It&#x27;s a big deal. &gt; Justice is to be blind. Which means if a crackhead and a cop come to a judge and requests the legal authority to break into a home with lethal force, the judge should weigh both requests the same.<p>A judge does not have the power to grant a random private citizen the right to break into someone else’s home, with or without legal force, under any circumstance. Even a court order to allow breaking into your own property, say to evict squatters or tenants, would involve law enforcement. The judge can’t just deputize you like it’s the Wild West. That&#x27;s my point - not that a judge should grant a warrant to a crackhead, but that they should act as if they&#x27;re granting a warrant to a crackhead. So basically the opinions, social standing, and claims of the entity requesting the warrant are irrelevant. Only the actual evidence should be considered by a judge when granting a &quot;right to wantonly kill&quot; because that&#x27;s exactly what a warrant is at the end of the day. It should be taken very seriously, and unfortunately, it&#x27;s not. &gt; Aren&#x27;t magistrate judges supposed to take the police&#x27;s word for this?<p>No.  They have to <i>convince</i> a judge who is neutral in the matter.  They have to have probable cause the criminal activity has&#x2F;is occurring at the stated location the warrant is requested to be issued for.  And the officers are under oath for this process, yet we see very few repercussions for a breakdown in this process.  The affiant is open to persecution for perjury.  The officers in the Taylor case lied by listing her and two others on the warrant. [0]<p>It&#x27;s not an adversarial process, it&#x27;s one of fact based decision making. Why would the judge blindly trust or mistrust the officer?  The judge should trust the facts being presented are true, but that doesn&#x27;t constitute a rubber stamp.  And, as stated, if said officer lies about that evidence they should be prosecuted appropriately.  Facts are often questioned to ascertain validity, that clearly did not happen in her case.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wave3.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;breonna-taylor-shooting-warrant-says-suspect-used-her-apartment-hide-drugs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wave3.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;breonna-taylor-shooting-war...</a> Right, the facts presented to the judge, taken as stated, have to add up to cause for a search. Judges shouldn&#x27;t ignore a paucity of factual assertions. I don&#x27;t doubt that many do. But short of an adversarial process, which I don&#x27;t think can work with warrants, I don&#x27;t know what you can do to mitigate a police officer fabricating evidence. This is becoming nothing but a semantic problem. Where lies the line between &quot;judges shouldn&#x27;t ignore a paucity of factual assertions&quot; and &quot;judges should be adversarial towards a warrant application&quot;?<p>But to me, the more important question is &quot;what are the ramifications for subverting the intended warrant process&quot;? It seems that both sides here are arguing that the warrant process should be based on veracity and proportionality, and it regularly isn&#x27;t. So what process oversees and corrects the rubber-stamping of warrants? In the US, the major ramification of exploiting misconduct to get warrants is that all the evidence stemming from that warrant is excluded from the trial, which is a rule we have that is not common in the rest of the world. &gt; The remedy for broken warrants happens at trial, with motions to exclude evidence.<p>But merely broken (if not fraudulently obtained) warrants aren&#x27;t a basis for excluding evidence, because of the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. That&#x27;s a good point. &gt; &quot;Aren&#x27;t magistrate judges supposed to take the police&#x27;s word for this?&quot;<p>What do you imagine is the point of having one? It&#x27;s to hold police accountable and Judge if what he&#x2F;she being told is potentiality total BS. &gt; The issue is: the evidence they gathered was that her home was specifically NOT part of any drug rings.<p>If you are dating a well-known drug dealer, expect your house to be raided. This shit isn&#x27;t rocket science. This is untrue, Taylor was listed on the warrant no different than the other two persons.

Read the warrant, and compare the language in it about her to the language of the other people suspected of using the building. She is listed as part of the &quot;and&#x2F;or on the person or persons of&quot;, I did. Note how there&#x27;s no criminal history associated with her, and none of her behavior is a predicate to the warrant. Compare to what the warrant says about the other occupants of the building. I&#x27;m not sure you read the warrant correctly. They clearly state they&#x27;ve seen Taylor&#x27;s car in front of the 2424 Elliott address. That wasn&#x27;t the address issued for the warrant. This is an implication being made. The warrant is issued for 3003 Springfield.<p>Maybe go reread it. You helpfully linked to it upthread. I&#x27;m comfortable that I&#x27;ve summarized it accurately. You&#x27;ve summarized it inaccurately unfortunately. Taylor was part of the warrant, not simply because it was her address. This has been publicly put to bed:<p><i>&quot;The connection with Glover is an important piece in this puzzle. The narcotics investigation was not just going after Glover, but several people believed to be involved in a drug trafficking ring.

It comported with what I&#x27;d already read about the case, which is that Taylor wasn&#x27;t the target of the investigation. See also the NYT&#x27;s coverage, asserting that Jamarcus Glover was the target. They explicitly call out her car being at a different address, not her own, in the warrant. This implicates her with the other two. She is clearly a target of the warrant. You can find validation of this in the warrant and the follow on reports done by the police department. At this point you&#x27;re pushing a false narrative pretty hard. She&#x27;s a target <i>of the warrant</i>. It&#x27;s <i>her house</i>. Glover was using <i>her car</i>. Of course she&#x27;s a target of the warrant. Her guilt or innocence in drug trafficking had nothing to do with the warrant&#x27;s issuance. She&#x27;s not the target of <i>the investigation</i>. If I&#x27;d been renting a room in her house, I&#x27;d be a target of the warrant too. Sorry, but she <i>was</i> the soft target of the investigation.

That&#x27;s even more worrisome. What? the warrant had nothing to do with her house. The police broke into a home, and shot the occupants, and then arrested the one who survived for practicing his 2nd amendment right to use a gun to defend himself from criminals that were trying to murder him. Aren&#x27;t the requirements for being a judge basically just (1) be a lawyer (2) get elected? I&#x27;d hazard a guess that the bar in terms of technical sophistication for a Tallahassee judge is not that high and that it wouldn&#x27;t be inconceivable for police to sell them a story about a scary hacker stealing people&#x27;s medical data. &gt; I&#x27;d hazard a guess that the bar in terms of technical sophistication for a Tallahassee judge is not that high<p>I do wonder how much of the response to this post just begins with the assumption that red states are incompetent. If this had happened in a blue state no doubt the comments would be different. On the internet it&#x27;s all ideology all the time. Florida is still a purple state and Wikipedia says Tallahassee is 2:1 Democrat:Republican. I&#x27;d have said the same about judges in most areas of the US that don&#x27;t have a significant tech presence. I would not feel that way about a judge in, say, Austin. You don’t even really need to be a lawyer in a lot of cases... &quot;The perpetrator used tor. Therefore it can only be this disgruntled employee.&quot; Per the article: &quot;The FDLE investigator claims he determined through his &quot;investigative resources&quot; that an Internet Protocol, or IP, address associated with Jones&#x27;s Comcast account was the source of the ESF-8 text message.&quot; <i>&gt; Per the article: &quot;The FDLE investigator claims he determined through his &quot;investigative resources&quot; that an Internet Protocol, or IP, address associated with Jones&#x27;s Comcast account was the source of the ESF-8 text message.&quot;</i><p>Comcast has this weird system that allows users to open their WiFi AP to other Comcast customers, in return for the ability to hop on to any other &quot;open&quot; Comcast AP.<p>AFAIK, Comcast made it opt-out.<p>So, someone could have driven by to use her AP specifically in order to implicate her. That is not how Comcast&#x27;s wifi works.

How much would you bet against that when the cop &#x27;determined through his &quot;investigative resources&quot;&#x27; the ip address of the guest Xfinity network still came back as &#x27;associated with Jones&#x27;s Comcast account&#x27; ??? Are you claiming that the Comcast modem uses a different IP address for Comcast-network side of the NAT?  That the modem has two routable addresses, one for the &#x27;house&#x27;, and one for the &#x27;open&#x27; world? Yes, that is generally&#x2F;approximately correct. I&#x27;m not sure precisely how it&#x27;s implemented on the public side, but you&#x27;re placed into a seperate VLAN that enforces the captive portal. Traffic from the public WiFi network is isolated from the subscriber&#x27;s traffic. That does not mean it uses a different public IP address that communicate with the rest of the intermet, I have seen dozens of such public&#x2F;private wifi systems, abd never seen one with a separate public IP That doesn&#x27;t at all answer GPs question though. That they&#x27;re isolated LANs doesn&#x27;t at all answer what WAN address they use.

It could be a false flag to result in this intimidation operation. Yeah, it would definitely be something I would think to do.  It&#x27;s not like Wi-Fi security is that tight either.  I&#x27;m mostly baffled by the resources being put into this crime.  There&#x27;s no way that if this weren&#x27;t politically motivated it would get this much effort. &gt; Proving who accessed it has become a huge forensic investigation at that point.<p>If you have some simple logging and a foolish &quot;hacker&quot;, it&#x27;s a pretty trivial investigation. It can be a trivial investigation.<p>It is also a trivial piece of data to plant.  Given the facts, I see no particular motivation for her to have sent the message.  However I do see a motivation for the department to try to frame her.  And they&#x27;ve already established a willingness to make stuff up.<p>And I&#x27;d also want to know more about the setup.  What is the machine used for?  What else is on it?  How is the logging set up?<p>Given the general incompetence shown, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the machine needed to provide ingress is also one that is publicly accessible for downloading data from the public.  With lots of stuff in unlogged POST requests.  If so, they could indeed have a request from her close in time to when the message was sent.  And it might be legitimately hard to figure out whether she was doing something authorized or not. Those sound like the kind of things you establish at a trial, right? Not in the USA.<p>Our plea bargain system is so lopsided that 97% of criminal charges end with a guilty plea without a trial.  Even if she is 90% sure of winning at trial, unless she has a million dollars lying around and a deathwish, it STILL isn&#x27;t worth it to fight the system.<p>I first looked into this after Aaron Swartz&#x27;s suicide.  Every time I&#x27;ve looked since it has seemed even more broken.<p>This is bad news for anyone who cares about justice.  And good news for any authorities who are trying to target someone that they don&#x27;t like. That is not a remotely reasonable way of looking at the situation. Your odds in a criminal trial do not in fact reflect the likelihood that a random accused person will take a plea deal.<p>If we&#x27;re discussing police charging into houses of people accused of nonviolent crimes armed to the teeth, we&#x27;re on the same page. But otherwise, I&#x27;m not clear what your suggestion is here. What is unreasonable about my way of looking at the situation?<p>Look at what happened to Aaron Swartz.  If he lost at trial, he was facing a lifetime in jail.  They were also seeking damages that he had no hope of paying because his finances had already been drained by the legal fight.  A legal fight that was projected to cost over a million dollars more than already spent.<p>Or he could take a plea bargain.  Which would have put him in serious debt, in jail for a few years, and made him a life-long felon.<p>Or he could commit suicide.  Which, of course, he did.<p>In that surprisingly typical example, if his odds of winning were 90%, on average he spends as much time in jail if he chooses to fight.  Which he couldn&#x27;t afford to do.  And you still have to accept that chance of losing your whole life in jail.<p>In that situation, I&#x27;d probably have accepted the plea bargain.  No matter how much I believed myself to be in the right.<p>Given those incentives, it is somewhat surprising that 3% of people do choose to fight.  But then again, that&#x27;s down in the range of the portion of the population with serious mental illnesses. This is plainly false. Swartz&#x27;s own lawyer believed, in writing, after Swartz&#x27;s death, that had Swartz gone to trial and lost, he wouldn&#x27;t even been given a custodial sentence, and you can look at the sentencing guidelines and see why he reached that conclusion. The <i>prosecutors</i> didn&#x27;t demand a lifetime in jail; at their grimmest, most hardball state, they were suggesting (a laughable, given the guidelines, the fact that it was a first offense, and a non-remunerative crime) 7 years.<p>You wrote other things, and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t read them carefully, because I&#x27;m a nerd and a human and I can&#x27;t get past &quot;a lifetime in jail&quot;. I&#x27;ll try to revisit later and respond to them, and wouldn&#x27;t want to suggest my not responding to them is an indication that they aren&#x27;t good points.

As techdirt said at the time in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20120917&#x2F;17393320412&#x2F;us-government-ups-felony-count-jstoraaron-swartz-case-four-to-thirteen.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20120917&#x2F;17393320412&#x2F;us-go...</a>, the theoretical amount that he could have been put away for was 50+ years with a fine of up to $4 million.<p>That&#x27;s the lifetime that I was talking about.<p>The fact that they were seeking a far lesser conviction, didn&#x27;t stop them from throwing around those figures.  And I&#x27;m sure that Aaron Swartz had to think about those numbers.<p>Incidentally Aaron Swartz wasn&#x27;t even the first programmer to commit suicide while being prosecuted by a team including Stephen Heymann.  That dubious honor goes to Jonathan James in 2008.<p>All of this notwithstanding, the important point is this.  For most of US history, plea bargains were illegal.  The way that they now railroad people into pleading guilty en masse demonstrates that they should still be illegal.  And the fact that our plea bargaining system is so lopsided means that the right to a fair trial is more theory than practice.<p>As a double check on that, consider <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;innocenceproject.org&#x2F;bad-drug-test-leads-to-wrongful-convictions&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;innocenceproject.org&#x2F;bad-drug-test-leads-to-wrongful...</a>.  Widely used roadside drug tests <i>that are inadmissable in court</i> have been found in practice to be wrong more than 1&#x2F;3 of the time.  And yet, 90% of people charged wind up accepting the plea bargain.<p>The state literally has no evidence that they can present in court.  And knows that a lot of those people are actually innocent.  But they all get railroaded.<p>Welcome to justice, American style. Yes, the DOJ lies in these press releases. Ken White, a former federal prosecutor, wrote a sort-of-famous blog post about this:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popehat.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;crime-whale-sushi-sentence-eleventy-million-years&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popehat.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;crime-whale-sushi-sentenc...</a><p>35 years is a &quot;whale sushi sentence&quot;. You have multiple ways of knowing it&#x27;s false, if you dig in: again, Swartz&#x27;s lawyer, the prosecutors own statements, and a straightforward reading of the sentencing guidelines (2B.1).<p>A particularly important detail of how sentencing works: charges group. The press releases often imply that you might serve time on every count, but in reality, in almost all circumstances, you serve the sentence associated with the most severe count.<p>The TechDirt article makes the same mistake. TechDirt has gotten better over the last few years; Mike Masnick got tight with the Ken White &#x2F; Popehat scene, and I assume they get feedback now on legal stuff. But that article is exactly the kind of thing what White is talking about when he says that the media bears some culpability in people&#x27;s misunderstanding of how sentencing works.<p>To be clear: all I&#x27;m litigating is whether Swartz faced a &quot;lifetime&quot; in prison --- or, for that matter, any double-digit-years sentence whatsoever. I&#x27;m not qualified to evaluate the sentencing guidelines, but my layperson read of the guidelines results in Swartz facing 1-2 years if he&#x27;d been convicted on everything. You shouldn&#x27;t take my word for it at all, but do note that my reading lines up with what Swartz&#x27;s attorney said as well. You are right.  I was remembering the press releases and not paying attention to the more detailed guidelines.  (Side note.  I&#x27;ve personally eaten at the restaurant that got shut down for serving whale meat.)<p>Still, the fact that prosecutors seek to create this confusion in the general public makes it likely that they seek to create it in defendant.  And stressed out people who should know better often wind up with bad conclusions because stressed out people under pressure don&#x27;t think well.<p>That said, Swartz&#x27;s attorney told Swarts that they would be seeking 7 years.  Your lay reading may say that they wouldn&#x27;t get it.  But the gap between what you hear from different sources is extreme.  And once you&#x27;re in front of a judge, I don&#x27;t trust courts to do the right thing. The press releases are a real problem, and I don&#x27;t understand what the DOJ gains by lying to the public about this stuff, since they are not in fact going to win any of these lurid fake maximum sentences, but they&#x27;re setting expectations that they will.<p>Swartz had excellent counsel, federal criminal defense attorneys understand the sentencing guidelines the way we understand singly-linked lists.<p>I agree, strongly, that there is a massive power disparity between ordinary defendants and prosecutors. But I&#x27;m going to gingerly venture that you can&#x27;t gauge the magnitude of that disparity by the number of cases that plead out. Some component of that is power imbalance, but the greater component of it is that law enforcement generally prosecutes lay-up cases. Many years of reading and listening to Ken White, who is no friend of the DOJ, leads me to believe this is even more true with federal prosecutions. By contrast the example of Harris County convinces me that law enforcement prosecutes a lot of shaky cases that they know wouldn&#x27;t hold up.<p>See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;report&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;report&#x2F;</a> for how there is only one county in the country that actually double checks drug tests after someone has plead guilty.  The result is that the one county alone manages to exonerate more people each year than the next three states combined.<p>There is no reason that I know of to believe that Harris County has an abnormal number of people wrongfully convicted.  They are only unusual in figuring that out and turning them free later. You&#x27;re not wrong and I feel roughly about prosecutors the way I assume you do. All I&#x27;m saying is that the plea deal rate is not an especially good metric; even in optimal circumstances, most charges would plea out. &gt;If he lost at trial, he was facing a lifetime in jail.<p>This is very likely not true according to his very good attorney. He felt that there would be no custodial sentence, and that losing the case was not likely. Right, a fair and honest trial that you hold after seizing her property and assaulting her family in front of her with the full legal backing of the state. Seems good. I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;re connecting the dots between executing a search warrant and &quot;unfair trial&quot;. You do not see any motivation here for a Covid activist to use a shared login to send an emergency message? The motivation was to save 17k lives. I agree, looks like a setup. She had already gone viral and didn&#x27;t need more attention. Nothing gained, tons risked means she had no motive. With everyone sharing a single user name and password for access, I don&#x27;t have a high level of confidence they have simple logging. The fact that they were able to get a search warrant suggests they have some evidence pointing to her. The most obvious evidence is server logs.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take a ton of expertise to set logging, most web services log access by default. I&#x27;d say the most obvious is an old e-mail sent to her containing the username and password. Do we know for certain that the judge who issued the warrant was aware that the same username&#x2F;password was repeatedly issued to different persons? &gt; The fact that they were able to get a search warrant suggests they have some evidence pointing to her.<p>Warrants do not require evidence, just a signature. &gt; If you have some simple logging and a foolish &quot;hacker&quot;, it&#x27;s a pretty trivial investigation.<p>The system is Internet-exposed. Even proving the user is in the country that you think they are is nontrivial. &gt; The system is Internet-exposed. Even proving the user is in the country that you think they are is nontrivial.<p>If you run an internet exposed service and you log IP addresses and have the ability to issue a warrant, it is entirely trivial to trace a request back to a specific house.<p>There are a lot of ways to obfuscate your IP address, but if you don&#x27;t know how to cover your tracks, it&#x27;s easy to get caught. &gt; If you run an internet exposed service and you log IP addresses and have the ability to issue a warrant, it is entirely trivial to trace a request back to a specific house.<p>Having an IP address alone is not generally probable cause enough to get a warrant, because they are regularly rotated, and shared, across geographic areas. And that&#x27;s assuming nothing proxying that connection at all. &gt; Having an IP address alone is not generally probable cause enough to get a warrant, because they are regularly rotated, and shared, across geographic areas.<p>It might not be enough to convict her, it is enough to get a warrant. While they do rotate, ISPs do this with law enforcement a fair amount and I&#x27;m pretty sure they keep track of who owns which IP at any given moment.<p>&gt; And that&#x27;s assuming nothing proxying that connection at all.<p>A clever knowledgeable person would proxy, most people wouldn&#x27;t know how. This is why I said it would be a foolish hacker. It&#x27;s also possible someone else tapped into her wifi and did it. Or maybe there was no IP.<p>I&#x27;m just suggesting what is the most obvious piece of evidence which a judge would accept to grant a warrant here. It might not be enough to get an <i>arrest</i> warrant, but it could be enough for a <i>search</i> warrant.<p>Find out the ISP that owns the address, ask the ISP what customer it was assigned to at the time in question, and while that doesn&#x27;t tell you who was using it for the particular accesses you are investigating (it could be anyone in the house at the time, or someone outside using that house&#x27;s WiFi, or someone from anywhere in the world using malware installed on a computer in the house), it does tell you that that house has a decent chance of having relevant evidence, and that will probably be enough to get a warrant to go look for that evidence. Yes IP addrs are shared and rotated, etc.<p>That does not negate the fact that an ISP can trivially correlate a time-stamped IP addr with a specific user. Is this merely an assertion or do you have evidence to back up that this isn’t enough for probable cause? I believe a whole lot of people have been served search warrants due to ISP logs. An ISP log contains more than just an IP address, they contain customer information as well. And to obtain that log the ISP either has to cooperate, or the police have to get another warrant. The IP address by itself isn&#x27;t enough to get the warrant to raid a house. If that is the case the people who green lit this design should be culpable for gross negligence. I have to admit that stories like this evoke a really strong, visceral reaction in me.<p>The depiction of police (allegedly) escalating the situation with threat of deadly force, especially with kids present, literally (<i>not</i> figuratively) got my adrenaline going.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in hearing both sides of the story with supporting evidence. &gt; The depiction of police (allegedly) escalating the situation with threat of deadly force, especially with kids present [...]<p>Not &quot;allegedly&quot;. There is video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;GeoRebekah&#x2F;status&#x2F;1336065787900145665\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;GeoRebekah&#x2F;status&#x2F;1336065787900145665</a> Jesus, that second cop is going to pop himself in the face if he actually fires his gun doing that Call of Duty cosplay like that. &gt;I&#x27;d be interested in hearing both sides of the story with supporting evidence.<p>The thing is this story is not at all surprising or unusual for the US. This kind of stuff is constantly happening on an almost weekly basis and after all the evidence is collected the result is &quot;Yes this all did happen and no we are not going to do anything about it&quot; Along those lines, I recommended listening to a recent Radiolab episode that dissects US police departments&#x27; lack of <i>legal</i> responsibility to ensure people&#x27;s safety. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;radiolab&#x2F;articles&#x2F;no-special-duty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;radiolab&#x2F;articles&#x2F;no-sp...</a> This not happens frequently but innocent people also are either permanently injured&#x2F;traumatized&#x2F;dead.<p>US law enforcement has very little oversight on their use of force. No oversight.<p>Police departments are not required to report how many citizens they kill nationally, and they’re shielded from legal liability in virtually every case. Even when charges are brought, judges parse the law to an insane degree, to the point where sending attack dogs against a surrendering suspect in the woods is illegal, but not if they’re in a “grassy ditch”.<p>I’m not being hyperbolic, that’s an actual case where cops got off because there was no clear and specific precedent that what they were doing was wrong. And since they got off, they didn’t make new precedent to stop it in the future. Of course. It’s trivial to pick someone up when they leave the house for literally anything. You’re isolated and trapped in your vehicle, if it’s done properly you have no means of running. They have a patrol car pull you over like a normal traffic stop, officer asks you to exit the vehicle and the two agents you didn’t see place you under arrest. Easy. It’s done in murder cases all the time.<p>This person clearly was not a fugitive and I’d be surprised if she or her family posed any threat but they chose to enter her home guns drawn.<p>Why? &gt;&gt;It’s trivial to pick someone up when they leave the house for literally anything.<p>Yes, but it costs more and the potential hazard justifies it. Of course, if there are innocents involved the police might go in anyway, and they will allege such danger in the request for the warrant. Obviously Rebekah presented a suspected danger of continued cybercrime unless her alleged activity was interrupted immediately. Looking for the warrant...?<p>All laws implicitly carry the premise of enforcement by deadly force. What you see on the video is just stock procedure embodying that premise. This is the product of calling the police &quot;Law Enforcement Officers&quot;. To intimidate. That’s why. &gt; I&#x27;d be interested in hearing both sides of the story with supporting evidence.<p>I am not. As much as &#x27;anti-intellectual&#x27;, or &#x27;plain wrong&#x27; it may be it may be, I am not interested in seeing evidence produced by the state or local police.<p>The US has regressed to a fascist state. Neither the police, nor politicians, nor federal judges can be trusted at this point. The whole system reeks of corruption at every level. You can also apply hyperbole to the victim’s account of the story. Doesn’t make it a valid reason to discard it. There is a difference between the two bodies. One is a state with a history of escalating violence, blatant fascism, utter disregard for human lives and history of manufacturing evidence. The other is a person who as far as I know can still be given the benefit of the doubt. I get your point about the state, and I largely agree, but there&#x27;s also been enough stories of individuals manufacturing outrage to their advantage. So I wouldn&#x27;t give either party the benefit of the doubt here. I get your point as well, it is not the right way to see things, but at this point, I am tired with the whole situation and I don&#x27;t really see a way out of the situation for the States. I am lucky enough that I don&#x27;t need to deal with this, but sitting here idle isn&#x27;t really comforting either. Sort of maybe... I feel like you&#x27;ve never visited Florida.  I can&#x27;t imagine a scenario where she is in the wrong, just that she didn&#x27;t comply.  Florida is full of authoritarian nut jobs.  DeSantis is a literal plague. &quot;I&#x27;d be interested in hearing both sides of the story with supporting evidence.&quot;<p>Me too.<p>Coming in guns drawn is not that uncommon in that scenario. You have a suspect refusing to answer the door for 20 minutes, so you don&#x27;t know if they are preparing an ambush or other danger. Why did you decide to take the Police&#x27;s story as truth? Do you actually believe that this person, a scientist with zero criminal history, decided to not answer the door for 20 minutes as cops were banging on it and yelling? How does that make sense to you? My favorite piece of cop story-telling was the photograph the Philly FoP posted of a child they claimed was abandoned during recent protests, imploring citizens to help them help children such as them and that they weren’t their enemies.<p>It turns out those police officers had been a violent mob that swarmed a woman’s car, ripped her out of it and gang assaulted her before arresting her (she was later released without charge). The child they broke the window and took him out before taking his picture and using it for propaganda. But they got their child for a photo op, so I suppose it was justified.<p>FWIW, the caption was:\n“We are not your enemy,” the union said in the posts showing Young’s son. “We are the Thin Blue Line. And WE ARE the only thing standing between Order and Anarchy.” Yeah, that case was terrible[1]. The video is horrifying[2].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;philadelphia-fop-posts-toddler&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;philadelphi...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;929752605&#x2F;mom-dragged-from-suv-beaten-by-officers-with-toddler-in-back-seat-filing-suit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;929752605&#x2F;mom-dragged-from-su...</a> Not Abner Luoima?

Charges filed, no conviction, on stalking and revenge porn charges. Thanks for posting, but... why bother? Nobody here is interested in the facts of the case. The article has statements from her in there. Did she deny at any point that she didn&#x27;t wait 20 minutes? Seems odd that she wouldn&#x27;t deny that part. But true, for all we know, none of the facts have been corroborated. To get the warrant, a judge would have to sign off on it with evidence meeting a probable cause standard. Also, this is the journalist&#x27;s story, not necessarily one of either party. “Yes you see. It made sense for me to point a gun at a child because I was made to wait for 20 minutes”<p>If I was a better writer, I’d adapt these things to prose and write up some Alice in Wonderland style story. People will go to the most ludicrous lengths to defend the most incredulous actions by police. Was the kid gonna throw his Tonka truck at him? The officer in the video comes in with gun drawn, and points the gun upwards as he approaches the stairs.<p>The &quot;point a gun at a child&quot; part comes in that her children where upstairs, but if the cops are looking out for hidden gunmen, why would they belief what she says. I didn&#x27;t see anything ludicrous in this article. The father was supposedly in the house too, so could be more than Tonka trucks. There are many countries that handle this scenario[1] without guns, every time. Maybe she had headphones in.<p>[1] Suspect accused of a non-violent offense, with no violent history. Do those countries have similar levels of gun crime against cops? Examples? (Bonus if you state examples with delayed compliance and possible presence of weapons)<p>Her whole family had headphones in? She had headphones in even while talking to and hanging up on the police? Seems unbelievable in case. Police in the UK are routinely without firearms, so I think in this case the burden of proof would be on you to show they’re regularly entering houses of people suspected of computer crimes with weapons drawn. Citizens also don&#x27;t routinely own firearms in the UK, so the two are related. I wasn&#x27;t the one making a claim about what happens in other countries, so I don&#x27;t need to provide evidence of their claim. My claim is that the actions in this specific situation showed no misconduct and was consistent with similar situations (non-compliance and building searches) in this country. You want evidence? Use a right to know request for the procedures from your local department. You can also read books like The Tacticle Edge to gain an understanding of what&#x27;s actually going on. Germany: for white-collar crime, they&#x27;d usually arrest you by sending y0u a letter asking you to please come in. Even if she were guilty, she wouldn&#x27;t be looking at jail time where it makes any sense for a regular person with family to try running.<p>Soeaking of idiots ruining their life: Assange might be a good example that people know. He was allowed to surrender on his own&#x2F;with his lawyers (first time around). Not sure about his latest arrest, but IIRC he was resisting and all they did was humiliate him by carrying him out like a petulant child. Anything &quot;hacking&quot;&#x2F;&quot;unauthorized access&quot;, even if fairly trivial, will easily get your home raided and hardware confiscated in Germany too. They&#x27;re unlikely to be waving guns around though. Be harder to find counter examples. I can&#x27;t think of many &quot;western&quot; nations where it&#x27;s normal for the police to go in to a house for a non violent office with people with no history of violence with guns drawn. &gt; Coming in guns drawn is not that uncommon in that scenario.<p>It really should be uncommon though. Why do you say that? If the expectation is that the cops will come in with weapons drawn any time they execute a warrant then we have to realize that this will result in people accidentally being killed. Does the standard for evidence for obtaining a search warrant justify the increased risk of someone innocent dying?<p>Some people would argue that not having guns drawn in this type of case would result in more police deaths. I agree but don&#x27;t view this as a deal breaker. How many civilians will die with guns drawn vs how many police officers die without?  Should we count civilian and police lives the same in this situation? Police officers are compensated for the risks they take and have protective gear like body armour to reduce this risk. In the linked video I don&#x27;t see the police using any head covering other than ball caps. If they thought there was a risk why didn&#x27;t they put on helmets? I&#x27;m sure the Tallahassee police have access to that kind of PPE. The fact that they chose not to wear full PPE suggests to me that they didn&#x27;t believe there was a substantial threat in the home. If she was compliant, they would typically ask everyone to exit the house before they enter to clear it. This scenario specifically took a different approach. I don&#x27;t see a higher risk of innocent people being killed, so maybe you can gather some statistics on that since the scenario is really a counter example to that.<p>Every building search is considered high risk. It&#x27;s not an extreme risk, which is why they didn&#x27;t execute it as a no-knock with SWAT, but there is still risk. The actions taken appear to consistent with that level of risk. &gt; so maybe you can gather some statistics on that<p>Here&#x27;s what a quick google search turned up.<p>This link [0] shows that US police kill over three times as many people, per capita, than Canadian police. However, I think there are other issues, like easy access to guns, that affect this stat so this isn&#x27;t really a very useful stat for our discussion.<p>This group [1] has been collecting info on arrest related deaths but a quick look only showed me links to how they collect data and not the actual data. It also looks like they stopped their surveys in 2012.<p>This paper [2] has some of the most relevant stats I&#x27;ve found for our discussion and covers use of lethal force by police between 2009-2012. From their numbers, 83% of victims were armed or believed to be armed (this includes toy guns, etc) and over 93% of the deaths were from firearms. If we assume that the 7% of deaths were the police didn&#x27;t shoot all apply to unarmed victims then 10% of the people killed by police were unarmed and shot. Their stats also show LEOs being killed in less than 2% of these incidents. Their numbers do show 9% of these cases resulting in an injury to LEOs but we don&#x27;t have numbers on non-fatal police caused injuries so I don&#x27;t want to compare apples to oranges.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;policekillings&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;policekillings&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bjs.gov&#x2F;index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=82\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bjs.gov&#x2F;index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=82</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6080222&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6080222&#x2F;</a> I think I remember this paper from a while back, but read it based on a different perspective (ethnicity).<p>Unarmed in the context of this paper would only be as it applies to deadly weapons. The suspect could still pose a threat with an alternative weapon (such as a pipe) or even pose a threat with bare hands too. The percent of people killed without posing an immediate threat would be more appropriate, and was 5% (would like to see the details of those with prosecution metrics). I would guess that 5% that mostly fits in the 7% you mentioned (which includes cars, suffocation, falls, etc), but unfortunately the paper doesn&#x27;t seem to get granular enough for that. So I don&#x27;t think we can draw a good conclusion from this paper that there were more civilians unjustly shot by police than the police being shot by civilians (the paper leaves out non-fatal incidents too). On that note too, the 2% officer fatality rate you show would not be fully encompassing. Meaning, it would be missing encounters in which the suspect killed the officer without also being killed. Do not point a gun at something you do not intend to shoot.<p>There is no reason to draw your weapon in this context. Danger should be determined from context clues, not defaulted to the highest priority.<p>There is no reason in hell you can ever justify pointing a weapon at a child. Period. That goes beyond bad policing and into disrespecting guns and plain stupidity. This is someone’s home not a war zone. How about gang members under the age of 18?<p>It would be great if we had good video of how the gun was pointed and where the people were. It was likely only pointed up the stairs in a &quot;low-ready&quot; manner and not aimed. But we will never know.<p>How about defiantly refusing to open the door and a past conviction for assaulting an officer as context clues? I honest would like to know, from your perspective when should a police officer NOT have gun drawn? Seems like you think there is danger lurking every where, so should cops just go around with assault rifles at the ready all the damn time? I didn&#x27;t say guns should be drawn all the time. Someone&#x27;s overly emotional and absolute statement incorrectly stated that guns should never be pointed a children. The scenario we are discussing is building searches, which are high risk and the behavior was appropriate in this example. Not to mention there is no evidence showing the guns being pointed directly at anyone. We have a video its at the very top of the link.<p>At least three pistols were drawn by officers entering the home. The first officer doesn&#x27;t draw his weapon until after interacting with the suspect, being told her husband and children are home, and then entering the home. If she has a previous conviction for assaulting an officer that wouldn&#x27;t matter since she was already removed from the situation at this point. The first and third pistols I saw were pointed at the floor the whole time. The second officer has his pistol aimed at the top of the stairs as he is walking towards the bottom of the stairway. &quot;We have a video its at the very top of the link.\n...\nThe second officer has his pistol aimed at the top of the stairs as he is walking towards the bottom of the stairway.&quot;<p>And like my comment said, we don&#x27;t see any people at the top of the stairs, so we don&#x27;t know if it was aimed at anyone or not. Even if there are people up there, we can&#x27;t tell if the gun is aimed at anyone or pointed &quot;low&quot; (into the top few stairs) or at a higher angle to aim at a person as it&#x27;s only a 10 degree or so difference in angle and we don&#x27;t see the full scene. All we can do is make assumptions, which isn&#x27;t helpful. Based on the actions of the people we do see I don&#x27;t think there was anyone visible at the top of the stairs. However, the reason for having a weapon up when doing corner drills or stair drills isn&#x27;t because you&#x27;re pointing at someone already in view, it&#x27;s to have the weapon pointing at someone who comes into view. His weapon is up because he thinks someone might either step into view or become visible as he continues to move. He is the only LEO I see not pointing his weapon at the floor the whole time so his actions stand out to me.<p>He may have been following his SOPs perfectly. I don&#x27;t think this is an appropriate SOP for LEOs to use in this situation. I don&#x27;t think this case called for having weapons drawn at all. My view is that this SOP is likely to contribute to unnecessary civilian injuries and deaths. Usually you have the gun up, but not aimed up (eg at the top few stairs but not above them), otherwise you&#x27;re blocking your view of threats that are crouched or prone if you have the gun fully up and aimed at a standing adult torso level.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t this be appropriate when clearing a building with unknown threats when dealing with an uncooperative person? The only way it leads to unnecessary injuries is if the officers don&#x27;t make a proper identification of a threat&#x2F;non-threat, which can happen with the gun in other positions too.<p>This type of search wouldn&#x27;t have been necessary anyways if she had complied immediately. They would have normally asked everyone to exit before doing their search, but once the suspect has been uncooperative and they gain entry they need to be proactive about the search to avoid evidence destruction or suspect fortifications given the suspect&#x27;s actions. Now had she opened the door quickly, I would agree that the actions would not have been appropriate because you&#x27;re supposed to clear the building by voluntary means first. In this case, the suspect&#x27;s family declined that voluntary option by not complying. Because you never have &quot;accidental&quot; shootings when there are no guns involved? How do you tell the difference between the ones without guns? (And knives, other weapons, bare hands) What situation can&#x27;t you say that about? Should the cop handing you a city sticker ticket also have a gun drawn on you? So you&#x27;re clearing house as part of a warrant and you know what threats are in it? Police would love a psychic like you. Maybe we should let you go in first all the time. If it was an option? And I didn&#x27;t have to travel? And I could review the warrant application and just &quot;go in first&quot; for houses like this woman&#x27;s, and Breonna Taylor&#x27;s? Ok?<p>Being a police officer isn&#x27;t close to one of the most dangerous jobs in America, but being in contact with an adversarial police officer is one of the most dangerous situations to be in. I&#x27;d be more afraid of the police, like many people. You would have to go in for all of them because it&#x27;s your job, not pick and choose.<p>&quot;Being a police officer isn&#x27;t close to one of the most dangerous jobs in America, but being in contact with an adversarial police officer is one of the most dangerous situations to be in.&quot;<p>This is a logical fallacy. It can be dangerous to be at the hands of an hostile officer, but then an equal comparison would be to say that being a police officer I&#x27;m the presence of an armed violent criminal is dangerous.<p>But like you said, being an officer is not the most dangerous profession. Just like being in the presence of a police officer is not that dangerous. No, your statement is not equivalent to mine. George Floyd wasn&#x27;t an &quot;armed violent criminal&quot;. Neither was Eric Garner. Neither was Breonna Taylor. Neither was Daniel Shaver. Just cheery picking examples, huh? Each scenario would need to be evaluated individually and would likely have different issues. For example, the cops in Floyd&#x27;s death ignored PATH training and the one&#x27;s in the Taylor death lied to the judge to get the warrant. What legal obligation did she have to answer the door?<p>Seriously- I’m not just being difficult here. Threats of deadly force should not be the default.<p>For context, this is coming from someone who carries a handgun every day for personal reasons. I’m not at all uncomfortable with guns. I am <i>extremely</i> uncomfortable with law enforcement using guns in a way that would get me arrested, charged, and convicted when there is zero legal justification for them to do so. The warrant obligates you to answer.<p>You also don&#x27;t have the duties assigned to police. That&#x27;s the difference. If you have the legal authority to clear a building, you could act lawfully the same way they did. It may not be uncommon in the US but shouldn&#x27;t it be? Do you know what your rights are when the cops show up at your door with a search warrant? If that happened to me I&#x27;d probably be finding and calling a lawyer with that 20 minutes, not setting up an ambush for the cops in a house with children inside. But they couldn&#x27;t possibly know if she&#x27;s doing one or the other.<p>The rights&#x2F;procedures for the search warrant vary by state. I have a general understanding of them for my state.<p>Every citizen should learn their rights. I think it&#x27;s terrible, and a sign of a poor state of education and civic duty that so few people know their rights. This lack of knowledge allows violations to happen without any punishment. I&#x27;m always amazed at how often cops approach every day tasks with weapons drawn. Reading the article (and being aware of the ongoing story) there&#x27;s no indication (to me) that there would be any hostility facing the officers. Thus it is easy to draw a conclusion of threat escalation from the police towards a citizen (if this is the wrong conclusion to draw then the police need to do a lot more work to justify their actions and explain why they thought there was a threat, because right now no one should buy that). This is unacceptable gun behavior in any environment and goes against conventional training (I&#x27;m sure there are gun users here or people who at least shot in the boy scouts or something). I mean officer #2 even appears to have his finger on the trigger (officer #1 doesn&#x27;t). There&#x27;s a rule &quot;never point a weapon at something you do not intend to destroy.&quot; Pointing a weapon at a person indicates they are willing to destroy (kill) that person. This is unacceptable in non-violent cases where there is not an equal force against them. I just can&#x27;t imagine the training they get. It makes me feel like Surviving Edged Weapons[0] is, at least in spirit, used. [1]<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people with bad trigger control and not knowing proper gun safety, but I&#x27;ve seen it far too often from police. The acceptable level of this for police is zero and it isn&#x27;t even close to that.<p>[0] This is a cult classic for &quot;Bad&quot; movies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c4ZpyKSmgdE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c4ZpyKSmgdE</a><p>[1] From what I&#x27;ve seen, it does still seem like they do similar training that is highly fear based. As in &quot;you could die at any second. It is you or them&quot; and does not reflect the reality that being a cop is relatively safe. At least that narrative is not in the public domain. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-06-23&#x2F;how-dangerous-is-police-work\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-06-23&#x2F;how-da...</a> <i>I mean officer #2 even appears to have his finger on the trigger (officer #1 doesn&#x27;t).

And should be grounds for firing the cop.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how many on HN have shot a gun.  But if you&#x27;ve got a qualified instructor, before you are even allowed to TOUCH the gun, you need to memorize the 4 basic rules of gun safety.<p>1. Every gun is always loaded.<p>2. Never point a gun at anything you&#x27;re not willing to destroy.<p>3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you&#x27;re ready to fire.<p>4. Be sure of your target and what&#x27;s behind it.<p>The second cop failed the last 3 rules.  Was he willing to destroy the children?  Was he ready to shoot when he put his finger on the trigger?  Was he sure of his target and what&#x27;s behind it?<p>Given that the answer is no, he shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to handle that gun.  He&#x27;s a danger to the public, and a liability to the police department. In my opinion, police should be held to the highest standard. It seems like they&#x27;re held to the lowest. &quot;Police business is a hell of a problem. It’s a good deal like politics. It asks for the highest type of men, and there’s nothing in it to attract the highest type of men.&quot;<p>(Raymond Chandler, 1943) Police are often the highest paid employees on a government&#x27;s payroll. They get to retire with a full pension after only 20 years of working, and they often make as much as, or more than, software engineers do. The strong-arm of the state needs to be held to a high standard. On the flip side, I had a friend who was a homicide cop in NYC.<p>By the time he retired, he was broken by the things he&#x27;d seen and dealt with that nobody should ever see or deal with.  He got a nice pension, but he earned it. My grandfather was a detective. He never once talk about his day as a cop to us the grandchildren. He was very cynical and suspicious of other people too. I guess this is what happened when you had to deal with the worst of society on daily basis. What kind of things did he see? Can you give the two worst examples? Here are a few.<p>He once commented that ever since he helped investigate <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Airlines_Flight_587\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Airlines_Flight_587</a>, the smell of jet fuel has made him sick.<p>Once there was an offhand comment about Soylent Green, and he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the stuff.&quot;  It was in a bottle that the murderer kept in his fridge.  If the police hadn&#x27;t thought to do a DNA test on the liquid, they wouldn&#x27;t have realized what it was.<p>Every Spring NYC has &quot;floaters&quot;.  These are people who died and were thrown into the river.  Often with weights attached.  As the water warms slightly, the body starts decomposing and eventually bloat from the gas makes it buoyant so it comes to the surface.<p>He once commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that there is a way that one human can kill another that I haven&#x27;t seen.&quot;  He then began giving a long list.<p>Good enough? <i>&gt; In my opinion, police should be held to the highest standard. It seems like they&#x27;re held to the lowest.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bit harsh. Standards (and holding to them) varies considerably by jurisdiction (and sometimes by precinct).<p>And before anyone accuses me of making a &quot;Not All Police&quot; argument or anything similar, I&#x27;ll point out that, generally speaking, poor enforcement of such standards (and harsher responses by officers) seem to be associated with communities that are poorer or have more minorities.<p>There are also issues with &#x27;problem officers&#x27; getting shuffled off to departments in other cities or states without adequate record keeping or sufficient scrutiny, which can result in them tending to collect or concentrate in certain places (and predictably, that makes it more likely that such officers will have like-minded colleagues that are willing to cover for them).<p>This is definitely a &quot;wicked problem&quot;. &gt; <i>That&#x27;s horrible. And should be grounds for firing the cop.</i><p>A common misunderstanding. The police in the USA are regarded as above the law; rules don&#x27;t apply to them.<p>You&#x27;ll never find a prosecutor willing to address criminal behavior like this by police.<p>If you want to fix this, do a five whys on that, not some idiot cop waving his gun around at children. What should be and what is are different.<p>News at 11. If you fire this cop, they&#x27;ll hire a new one, and put them through training that says that everyone might be armed and they&#x27;re authorized to use force when they think they&#x27;re in danger, and they&#x27;ll continue sending cops out to raid people&#x27;s houses for crimes where there&#x27;s absolutely no evidence the suspect has ever even thought about being armed.<p>This cop almost certainly was in fact willing to destroy whatever he pointed his gun at and whatever might be behind it, because that&#x27;s how he was trained. This is strange logic. You&#x27;re saying that they shouldn&#x27;t fire the cop because any new hires are going to be incompetent? This doesn&#x27;t make sense. You can both fire the cop and call for better training. Besides, if we&#x27;re constantly firing cops for not following <i></i><i>basic</i><i></i> gun safety, either we solve the problem or it becomes cost prohibitive to not properly train. You can indeed have both. One, I think this cop will argue he <i>was</i> following basic gun safety, that he was authorized to use deadly force against anyone or anything in the house. I don&#x27;t think this cop was incompetent nor would his replacements be; I think he was doing what he was trained to do, and they&#x27;ll train his replacements the same. You&#x27;ve got to make his actions fireable, first. You can&#x27;t just wish they were.<p>Second, we won&#x27;t fire the cops who don&#x27;t follow basic gun safety - we will <i>at most</i> fire the ones who get caught on video as part of a story of national importance. This cop isn&#x27;t the one bad-trigger-discipline cop in that department, let alone the country. Fire him without figuring out how to systemically fire them all, and cops will dismiss it as politically-motivated persecution, have some protests about #BackTheBlue or maybe even a work stoppage, and then go back to business as usual, with the same trigger discipline.<p>And the fired cop will get a job in another department.<p>I agree you can have both. I just think you can&#x27;t have one without the other. The gun safety rule applies to things you actively intend to destroy, not things you&#x27;re merely &quot;authorized&quot; to destroy. Furthermore, cops aren&#x27;t authorized to use deadly force against anyone in the house <i>a priori</i>, only if there&#x27;s sufficient danger (IANAL).<p>(Not disagreeing with your overall point, just saying that it would be (IMO) laughable for a cop to try to make those arguments, even considering their training.) I&#x27;d imagine that in this case, as in many others, it is purely punitive. The state just likes reminding &#x27;troublemakers&#x27; of its monopoly on violence. Then we should sanction the whole state for minor infractions of one officer.<p>Municipal bond offerings are currently exempt from SEC registration and disclosures, we can get the federal government to change that upon evidence of small infractions and force an extremely high level of disclosures such as policing statistics for the next 10 years if the municipality wants to raise capital.<p>This beats activist&#x27;s state-level FOIA requests.<p>It doesn&#x27;t harm the ability of an officer to make split second decisions and get home safely, which is usually their argument against any proposal.<p>It doesn&#x27;t require a whole civil suit or criminal suit for anything to happen.<p>Just gets the message across that actions have consequences. It lets them run out of excuses so their real thoughts can be made as clear as day. There are sanctions but I think it doesn&#x27;t practically work because the government is responsible for punishing his people.<p>I think we need private police, subject to the same law as anyone else, and third party arbitration in private courts when something happens. yeah but then you make the cops sad cause they can&#x27;t be shitheels anymore. so that&#x27;s out. If this is the case (I&#x27;m not saying it is or isn&#x27;t), then that is more akin to gestapo tactics and should not be even remotely acceptable by anyone in society. More so those on the right who often draw analogies to the Soviet Union. If you are surprised by these tactics, there are hours and hours of video you should watch from peaceful protests that have occurred over the last 6 months. Surprised? No. Trying to not make a left or right comment? Yes. It&#x27;s an oddity of US politics that this is perceived as a left or right issue at all, in that one &#x27;side&#x27; seems to have adopted the stance that police should be allowed do pretty much anything with no repercussions or meaningful oversight. Outside the lunatic far-right, this sort of thing would be condemned from all sides in many developed democracies. &gt; It&#x27;s an oddity of US politics that this is perceived as a left or right issue at all,<p>There are several major issues like that in US politics.<p>Why is climate change a left or right issue?<p>Why is wearing masks a left or right issue? &gt; Why is climate change a left or right issue?<p>Because businesses don&#x27;t want to pay&#x2F;lose money on climate change action, and the &quot;party of small businesses&quot; endorses this view.<p>&gt; Why is wearing masks a left or right issue?<p>Because the virus was seen as a political&#x2F;messaging problem (rather than a public health issue) by one of the sides, therefore wearing masks was viewed as capitulation. Because some sizable proportion of humans will believe any crap they&#x27;re told, provided the message is couched in terms of something they&#x27;re afraid of, and the right has decided to cater to those people leaving the left with the people who like to think about things for themselves. I don&#x27;t believe this is a good argument.\nThe same argument has been done endlessly for the other side.<p>There are definitely people who believe the party line on everything. If that&#x27;s the case, that could be an indication you&#x27;re not thinking for yourself. &gt; leaving the left with the people who like to think about things for themselves.<p>You really broadcast your ignorance and your failure to understand others positions with comments like that. For what it is worth, this isn&#x27;t only a problem in the US. It is just that the US only knows what&#x27;s up in the US and the US news is seen by most other western countries. There&#x27;s also an argument to be made that US news highlights the worst people and not the average person. &gt; Why is climate change a left or right issue?<p>Because as with all politics it determines the distribution of resources. Those who stand to gain v&#x2F;s those who stand to lose have both heavily manipulated the science, or at least the reporting.<p>&gt;  Why is wearing masks a left or right issue?<p>Voluntary masking wouldn&#x27;t be. Compulsory masking runs afoul of those who have a fundamental belief in self-ownership, negative rights and reject most positive rights [1]. This has deep political roots.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Negative_and_positive_rights\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Negative_and_positive_rights</a> Yeah, that&#x27;s why all the anti-maskers screaming at their rallies are waving around their guns and big signs that say &quot;I reject Rousseau!&quot;<p>It _does_ have political roots, though, so you&#x27;re right about that.  But it&#x27;s much simpler than presuming a bunch of OANN viewers have read anything more complex than Ayn Rand.<p>The President didn&#x27;t want to wear a mask in public, so he scorned mask-wearing - contrary to every public health directive - and now a significant portion of the populace refuses to take that incredibly simple step that has been proven over and over to dramatically reduce infection rates.  That&#x27;s it.  It really is _that_ simple. Exactly. I can recall when the right was all upset about Ruby Ridge and Waco. Now that it&#x27;s people they perceive to be their enemies being punished they&#x27;re cool with it. Who on the &quot;right&quot; is cool with this? Genuinely asking. The President referred to police brutality against journalists as a “beautiful sight.” <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;trump-revels-in-beautiful-sight-of-law-enforcement-grabbing-journalist&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;trump-revels-in-beautiful-sight...</a><p>There are plenty of prominent Republicans explicitly supporting Kyle Rittenhouse (not a cop, but a similar event.)<p>There are, of course, vastly more examples of explicit support for police brutality and other lawbreaking in opposition to protests. Oh true, I thought the parent comment was talking about this DOH event specifically. The police (and their unions, and civilian voters with authoritarian pro-police ideologies) are a major political constituency on the right, one that Donald Trump had repeatedly pandered to (because he is a pro-police authoritarian). It is beyond naive to pretend “unaccountable police violence is good” isn’t a mainstream right-wing belief in 2020.<p>&gt; When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice.’ [Trump, July 2017]<p>&gt; If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell — I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise. They won’t be so much, because the courts agree with us too — what’s going on in this country? [Trump, July 2016]<p>&gt; “Sometimes they grab one guy, ‘I’m a reporter! I’m a reporter!” ...they threw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn.” [Trump, September 2020, clearly mocking the reporter in context]<p>So the people on the “right” who are cool with this are basically every Republican official and about 70m Americans who voted for Trump last month. Seems like a lot of people! Surprised to see your downvotes.<p>The police were literally started in the late 1800s to protect capital and share the responsibility of cost across all people. (In the South, they were tightly related to patrolling for slaves, in the north they were predominantly helping wealthy merchants protect warehouses and other stores of wealth.)<p>In the decades since, the police (and their unions) have had a long, long history of right wing action.<p>The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) is known for their &#x27;Red Squad&#x27;, which was used in the 1900s to bust up unions, leftists, and people suspected of being communists. They regularly welcomed literal Nazis into their ranks in the 30s and 40s.<p>The stories aren&#x27;t unique to Portland either. A common piece of police iconography is a Punisher skull. Police with SS tattoos are not uncommon. Law enforcement had existed for millennia, not the last two centuries. Greek polis had <i>nyctostrategoi</i> (literally, &quot;night officers&quot;) that patrolled and enforced laws as early as 500 BC. And Mesopotamian city states probably had police, too. Do people really believe that professional law enforcement didn&#x27;t exist until 1800 AD? Sorry, I was a bit vague. Yes, obviously law enforcement has existed for centuries. Uniformed police departments have not. Especially in the United States, where police violence is especially bad. (I had sort of implied this with the North&#x2F;South dichotomy, but was not explicit about it.)<p>Historically, enforcement of the law was a military, community, religious, or rotating obligation. It was not particularly respected, organized, or high class. There were some exceptions, but in general our current model of policing evolved from English tithings. Groups of men who were responsible for bringing criminals forward. These groups were collected into Shires, overseen by a Shire-reeve (later &quot;Sheriff&quot;). The shire reeve could round up a posse to go collect a criminal.<p>Over time, cities started to want to improve the protections for their capital. They wanted to try and prevent crime rather than hunt criminals. The night watch had a reputation of being low class and unruly, and the city of Glasgow decided to clean up their act. They founded the first uniformed police department in 1800 in an effort to be a visible presence in hopes of deterring crime.<p>Police in America were largely slave patrols, sheriffs and posses, and militias until the middle of the 1800s, when larger cities started following Glasgow&#x27;s model. As I pointed out in a response to your other comment [1] this is incorrect. Police as a public institution in the US date back to the colonial era, centuries before you claim the first police departments were formed. Altering the statement to saying that police were reformed to be more professional in the 1800s immensely different than claiming that police did not exist. The latter is akin to saying that armies didn&#x27;t exist until the early modern period because most soldiers were levies instead of professional solder.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25341633\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25341633</a> &gt; <i>The police were literally started in the late 1800s to protect capital and share the responsibility of cost across all people.

Organized police in the US date back to the early 1600s at the latest. In fact police existed in New York back when it was called New Amsterdam: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;police&#x2F;Early-police-in-the-United-States\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;police&#x2F;Early-police-in-the-...</a><p>I&#x27;m serious baffled as to how people got the idea that police were created in the 1800s. Do people really believe that cities like Boston and New York existed for centuries with nobody to enforce laws? Night watches, tithings, posses, militias, and sheriffs are not the same thing as police departments. And even still, the vast majority of night watches were privately funded in America. My link provides direct examples of law enforcement organizations that were publicly funded, as early as the 1630s:<p>&gt; Among the first public police forces established in colonial North America were the watchmen organized in Boston in 1631 and in New Amsterdam (later New York City) in 1647.<p>Again, police are as old as civilization. Laws without a body to enforce them are just words in paper (or clay tablets). Night watchmen aren&#x27;t police. Personally, I believe it&#x27;s dangerous to conflate the two -- modern police departments are very, very different than the more community organized (or elected) folks who watched over small towns. Organized, uniformed, powerfully armed standing patrol police forces like we have today are a relatively new phenomena.<p>That said, we&#x27;re skidding towards a semantic argument, so if you are comfortable agreeing to disagree here, I am too. We can continue to think each other wrong, looking at the same history. &gt; Night watchmen aren&#x27;t police. Personally, I believe it&#x27;s dangerous to conflate the two -- modern police departments are very, very different than the more community organized (or elected) folks who watched over small towns. Organized, uniformed, powerfully armed standing patrol police forces like we have today are a relatively new phenomena.<p>This isn&#x27;t a semantic disagreement, this is factually incorrect. ”Organized, uniformed, powerfully armed standing patrol police forces&quot; have absolutely existed in the US before the 1800s and date back to classical antiquity at least. Rome often employed it&#x27;s legions as police, and there was even a dedicated legion stationed specifically to police Rome [1]. It&#x27;s hard to get more &quot;Organized, uniformed, powerfully armed&quot; than deploying the military as a patrol force. And in the US professional police forces, not militia or community watch, have existed since the 1600s. And by the way, many police forces are still led by elected leaders - professional, organized police and community oversight are not mutually exclusive.<p>It might be fair to say that in the 1800s and early 1900s industrialization and technology had progressed to the point that police started to resemble modern police, and many US cities grew to the point that they started municipal police forces in this time frame. But the police of the 21st century with cameras, computers, dna testing, 911 systems and radios are arguably even more removed from the police of 1900 than the police of 1900 were to the police of 1800 or 1700.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cohortes_urbanae\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cohortes_urbanae</a> &gt; It&#x27;s an oddity of US politics that this is perceived as a left or right issue at all, in that one &#x27;side&#x27; seems to have adopted the stance that police should be allowed do pretty much anything with no repercussions or meaningful oversight.<p>This strikes me as the kind of characterization of other peoples&#x27; beliefs that they would find to be false, misleading, and uncharitable. Used to be that way in the US too. &gt;It&#x27;s an oddity of US politics that this is perceived as a left or right issue at all<p>Not that odd. One side believes in decentralized power which tends toward police doing &quot;pretty much anything&quot; according to their read of the situation, and another side favors reams of paperwork and regulations that may hinder effective policing.  The oddity in the US is how the media convinces people to pick one side and criticize the other absolutely, rather than commit to compromise. Fair enough. I would have liked if <i>the state shouldn&#x27;t use violence punitively</i> was just an American stance rather than a left or right one. It shouldn&#x27;t be, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m being a bit careful with my language. To normalize that it is in fact a bilateral issue. How to solve it and what to do about, sure, those are left and right opinions. But the fact that it is an issue needs to be normalized, because it is indeed a fact. Honestly this seems like a bonkers denial of reality:  the State is exactly the embodiment of the use and monopoly of violence.  Pretending otherwise is ignoring hundreds of years of empirical data. We aren&#x27;t denying or even objecting to the state&#x27;s monopoly on violence.  The problem is the word &quot;punitive&quot; there.  State violence should be a means to stop other violence.  It shouldn&#x27;t be used as a punishment by itself (beyond more indirect forms of violence such as denying someone&#x27;s freedom by putting them in prison). I wish the state wouldn’t use government agencies putatively, such as the IRS, but they have, and will probably increase. If you weren’t trying to make a left or right comment why use the word “right”? Half the problem is that you&#x27;ve been convinced that this is a left-right issue. It&#x27;s political, absolutely. But not left-right. Stand up for what&#x27;s just. Being careful with my language should not be indicative of believing that it is a left-right issue. Being careful of my language should be indicative that I believe people will interpret it as a left-right position and I&#x27;m not here to discuss politics. You&#x27;re talking about how society should be run and how the state should respond to issues within its purview. That&#x27;s inherently political.<p>I would say that being careful with one&#x27;s language to avoid offense is reasonable, if the hypothetical other party&#x27;s propensity for taking offense is reasonable. Incense at the specter of a political discussion is not reasonable. Discussions on HN are more interesting when the partisan temperature is turned down. A political discussion need not be divisive. Again, it&#x27;s not good that so many have been convinced that it <i>must</i> be. Yeah this is more on the other axis. Authoritarianism doesn’t care about left or right. This is something I&#x27;ve noticed. Often authoritarian vs anti-authoritarian views are mapped to left-right views. This makes conversation particularly confusing at times. I tend to notice when fairly central left-right anti-authoritarians speak they get accused of being left or right (whichever is opposite of the position the person they are responding to). I&#x27;m unsure how to have these types of discussions without them becoming left-right issues. You should check out the political compass [0]. It&#x27;s an organization but I&#x27;m more interested in the compass itself [1], which has left and right on the X axis and authoritarianism and anti-authoritarianism on the Y axis. It seems to succinctly describe one&#x27;s political ideology, although not to a granular detail. There is also the issue of multi-faceted extremism, where one takes views on different issues where when taken as a whole, the overall political philosophy does not fit into any one category. An example is being pro-gun-rights but left-leaning. PG wrote about this [2].<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Political_Compass\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Political_Compass</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;5&#x2F;5c&#x2F;Political_Compass_purple_LibRight.svg&#x2F;220px-Political_Compass_purple_LibRight.svg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;5&#x2F;5c&#x2F;Po...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;mod.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;mod.html</a> I recently stumbled upon Altemeyer and found his recent thoughts fascinating. He tries to approach the subject separately from left&#x2F;right. The PDF is free.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theauthoritarians.org&#x2F;options-for-getting-the-book&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theauthoritarians.org&#x2F;options-for-getting-the-book&#x2F;</a> That’s likely to a large extent a product of the US’s two party system. In multiparty democracies, you’ll usually get a selection of right-wing parties, from libertarian&#x2F; hyper capitalist types to moderate conservative parties (think Merkel’s CDU) to hard right to fascists. In the US, to some extent they’re packed uncomfortably into one party (though some of the CDUish tendency ends up in the other party), and the authoritarian end of the spectrum is assertive and noisy and tends to grab the narrative. That and left or right doesn’t care about Authoritarianism when they think the Authorities are on their side. Who is making it a left-right issue in this thread? I think if you check now you&#x27;ll see it. I was trying to keep the temperature low to reduce the instances of this. Fiery but peaceful protests, right? Or, the correct, non-orwellian term: violent riots. The case the right cares about is Roger Stone. He&#x27;s an old man, no threat to anybody, who was involved in normal legal proceedings. Somebody decided to make an example out of him. He got a heavily-armed pre-dawn raid, and CNN was right there to watch. Left and right are meaningless terms.<p>I&#x27;m on the right side economically but I&#x27;m fiercely anti authoritarian and I find this terrible.\nI don&#x27;t like the &quot;peaceful protests&quot; because it&#x27;s just destruction of private property but I hope they can create enough momentum to push for the privatisation of police. \nSome BLM leader in NY was organising something like that, a militia to defend their people. \nI speculate this is also why people like Kyle Rittenhouse were defending people in the protests despite not agreeing with the violence (before being identified as not part of the violent mob and attacked).<p>Incidentally I don&#x27;t think police privatisation is going to happen, even under a Biden presidency, because that would remove power from the government and neither democrats nor conservatives are happy with that. It’s obviously not the case, just a silly take. Do we really think “the state” is involved in telling police how to do their raids? Like DeSantis walked in to their planning meeting said to be extra mean, just to teach her a lesson? Most police academies subject trainees to hours of video footage of cops getting ambushed by people with guns, and drill into them that any situation can turn deadly in an instant. They are hard-wired to think that they can lose their life in any second in any interaction with any citizen no matter what the circumstances. Right, and that is why the &quot;more training&quot; argument I&#x27;ve heard some use as an alternative to the &quot;de-fund the police&quot; doesn&#x27;t hold water.<p>My own experience working near a lot of police early in my career led me to believe that the majority of the training instills a &quot;us vs them&quot; attitude in the police, and it carries through to everything they do. Combined with the constant bombardment of stories about the tiny percentage of cases where someone is actually violent and the results are predictable.<p>Frankly, i&#x27;m of the opinion that the vast majority of cops shouldn&#x27;t be carrying lethal weapons into the average traffic stop or whatever other activity is basically 100% safe outside of infinitesimal number of cases which go violent. After all, by pulling over, the person has basically already yielded to their authority. You need the proper training. You can review some of that training through right-to-know requests. You can also read <i>The Tactical Edge</i>. Many of the issues you see happen are because of incorrect or insufficient training. There can be an us-vs-them if it&#x27;s not done right.<p>Also, the threat on a traffic stop is not to be dismissed - there are officers attacked during those stops. Those stops are not just for traffic violations, but can also happen if the vehicle matches one used in a crime or reported stolen. Do you really want to be unarmed when making traffic stops or other calls? Sometimes they may stop, not to yield to authority, but to ambush the officer so they can get away without being identified. Which is of course why they are suppose to report the traffic stop as they make it. Plus, in the case of warrants and the like, the second they get a hit on their terminal it sets off flags in dispatch&#x2F;etc which will immediately start sending backup.<p>Those were the systems I was working on 20+ years ago. I think that&#x27;s an argument for better training or a complete rethinking of training.  More of the wrong training will just result in bad behavior getting more entrenched.<p>Related to that point, defunding may actually have the opposite of the intended effect.  You may actually have to spend more money to increase accountability, change culture, and improve the quality of policing. Yes, you can probably rework it, but as another comment noted its entrenched culture at this point. So, even if a cadet gets out of training with good habits&#x2F;attitudes those can change very quickly when they start working with the more experienced officers. I&#x27;m sure it can be done, but it will likely take a zero tolerance level of push-back like has happened with sexual harassment in the corporate world to solve the problem.<p>And I don&#x27;t for a moment consider most police forces to be underfunded. The lions share of most city budgets are the police force, and it goes to buying armored cars and helicopters, and &quot;benchmark city&quot; ratios of police&#x2F;citizens. And where I live the armored car gets used once or twice a decade, and in all cases so far could have probably just called the larger city an hour away and borrowed theirs as was done 15 years ago before the purchase.<p>Some how we survived for a century with far less police, and outside of the crime wave of the 1970&#x2F;80&#x27;s which were likely caused in large part by other things, were generally safer too. That &quot;crime wave&quot; seems like it would have solved itself without the huge ramp up of police funding we now have today, although the tough on crime people like to attribute it to that. A large part goes to fighting the failed drug wars. Which in turn feeds into the massive prison populations we have now, the largest part of which are there for non violent crimes. Well, more training and proper training (and probably getting rid of a lot of the leadership). It’s not like this is new ground; plenty of places have reformed their police (in particular, after the fall of the iron curtain), and there are playbooks that have been moderately successful. This is a very naive understanding of police work. Pulling over does not mean a thing. If a small number of cases go violent, and you don’t know which ones, you cannot just ignore them. If 99.9% of contacts are non-violent, a cop who makes 1000 contacts is dead.<p>Violence has never gone down from defunding. Although this should be obvious, an alarming number of people don’t seem to be thinking rationally on that topic. It has certainly gone up after defunding, however. You shouldn&#x27;t make up numbers about the ratio of violent vs non-violent stops. The vast majority of police go for their entire careers without having to ever discharge their weapon. Police work is actually quite safe, they never appear in any of the top most dangerous professions lists. And compared with some of those lists <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;27&#x2F;the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;27&#x2F;the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-i...</a> they are paid much better due to being about the only job that is still unionized throughout the entire country. I&#x27;ve been pulled over by cops making $100+k a year, and its not all all uncommon for them to break $200k with overtime. (and this is in TX, not exactly known for CA salary levels). That’s not how data works unfortunately. You can’t average the experience of a Chicago beat cop with a desk duty cop from Nome Alaska. Besides that, number of discharges doesn’t tell much of the story.<p>They’re not paid better due to the fact that they are in unions at all. Otherwise teachers would be rich, and police departments in major cities wouldn’t be struggling to hire even with relatively high wages. They pay that because nobody wants the job and the public is inexplicably antagonistic towards cops who join out of a desire to help people.<p>Saying that it’s quite safe is absurd and obviously untrue. It didn’t make your top 10 list of professions with the most deaths, but it’s barely below the cut, so still in the top 20 easily. And again, that data doesn’t tell the whole story. This.<p>American police training routinely promotes an us-versus-them mentality. It instills the idea that every situation is a threat that must conquered and dominated. You can see this in their comments that the streets are &quot;a war zone&quot; and talk about being &quot;warriors&quot;, and a routine glorification of violence and stereotypes. This is why American police routinely <i>escalate</i> situations. Note on the video, the police don&#x27;t just pull guns, but then start agressively barking orders.<p>Contempt of Cop is real. If you, dear reader, don&#x27;t know (or believe) in this comment, read about &quot;killology&quot; and &quot;warrior cop&quot; training.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;warrior-cop-class-dave-grossman-killology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;warrior-cop-clas...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.killology.com&#x2F;sheep-wolves-and-sheepdogs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.killology.com&#x2F;sheep-wolves-and-sheepdogs</a> Of course, in reality, COVID has killed five times as many cops as criminals have. In normal years, traffic accidents are higher risks for them, and many other professions are more dangerous. Traffic accidents are the highest risk in normal years, followed by heart attacks. Those two reasons account for almost all of the on the job deaths for cops. This is very true(personal experience). It’s not just in the academy it’s in every training course.  All it takes is a jittery Rookie and things go wrong quick. &gt; &quot;Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents. After several attempts and verbal notifications that law enforcement officers were there to serve a legal search warrant, Ms. Jones eventually came to the door and allowed agents to enter,&quot; Plessinger said. &quot;Ms. Jones&#x27; family was upstairs when agents made entry into the home.&quot;<p>It’s weird too, because on one hand you have them being patient and restrained, on the other they decide to pull their guns out. I felt the same way when I read they waited for 20 minutes. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be stated if the cops initially showed up with vests and guns drawn or if more showed up after failure to comply. If it was the former, I could understand the shock and cloudy judgment experienced by the scientist when you&#x27;ve realized your house is under siege. Perhaps they viewed her uncooperative nature as the residents preparing for conflict. It&#x27;s possible they wouldn&#x27;t have drawn their weapons if the residents complied immediately. Relax.<p>You have 20 seconds to comply:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Hzlt7IbTp6M\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Hzlt7IbTp6M</a> It&#x27;s possible they wouldn&#x27;t have been so hesitant to open the door if cops didn&#x27;t have a reputation for shooting people with no consequence.<p>The people with actual power in this situation have the greater responsibility. &gt; The people with actual power in this situation have the greater responsibility.<p>This cannot be stated enough. It seems in our general conversations that whenever there is a tribal component to the discussion that this responsibility shifts when it aligns or disaligns with your tribe. I&#x27;ve always been a firm believer that you can complain about those in other tribes, but it is your responsibility to hold those in your tribe to a higher bar. After all, you don&#x27;t have a voice in the tribe you don&#x27;t belong to and your tribe isn&#x27;t perfect and can always seek to improve.<p>And there should never be a question about a person in a position of power being held to a higher responsibility than an average person. No one should be getting a pass on this, inside or outside of your tribe. That&#x27;s not really logical. If you think you&#x27;ll get shot for no reason, then surely you would think that your chances of getting shot will go up with non-compliance. If I think I&#x27;ll get shot for no reason, then there&#x27;s no point where I think I can do anything about my chances. There&#x27;s just nothing you can do when your home is surrounded by people who likely have at least one person who&#x27;s gone through &quot;warrior training.&quot;<p>Your options are pretty much comply and hope you don&#x27;t get shot, fight, hide somewhere and hope you don&#x27;t get shot when they storm in, or set up a camera streaming to someone you trust just in case you don&#x27;t survive. It looks like she used those 20 minutes to go with the latter option. &gt; If I think I&#x27;ll get shot for no reason, then there&#x27;s no point where I think I can do anything about my chances.<p>Thats terrible judgment. If you think you might be shot for no reason at all, then it certainly doesn&#x27;t improve your chances to start giving people reasons to shoot you. Perhaps preparing for conflict is the natural response to interacting with the police in the US, because that is what the police do before barging into your home and interacting with you. I&#x27;d lose my mind if some swine pointed a gun at my child. A message to police: don&#x27;t do that, and you won&#x27;t have a reason to be armed around me. &gt;<i>I&#x27;d lose my mind if some swine pointed a gun at my child.</i><p>I wonder if things like this are what honor duels were about in the past? A way to semi-legally call out someone personally with potentially severe consequences.<p>Pointing a gun at a kid in a situation like this seems like it should be punishable by itself. We need to codify a right to self defense against the police. Too many situations like this exist where the police place others in mortal danger. In a situation like this were the armed party not police it would be unquestionably legal for the victim to respond with deadly force. Police no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt and they deserve no special legal protections when they run around assaulting people with deadly weapons. An alternative is to eliminate or reduce qualified immunity. Who was in mortal danger? The video showed no evidence of a gun being aimed at anyone, simply up the stairs. It&#x27;s also not assault unless there&#x27;s motive. Without a physical or verbal act indicating unlawful use or potential use of violence, it would be hard to prove assault. (You might be surprised when you look up case law on this)<p>Your civilian scenario isn&#x27;t exactly congruent because you are missing the legal authority point. If you are a civilian with the authority to search a building (your house when you hear a noise at night for example), then you you would be justified in clearing the building in the same way the police did. The response of deadly force depends on if there are alternatives to that use of force (and greatly varies by state). In this case, the alternative to the occupant using deadly force is to comply with the warrant, and if necessary, sue in court for any damages. Of course they do. There are plenty of developing and underdeveloped countries where that’s how it works. Go see how well that works out for them. &gt; There are plenty of developing and underdeveloped countries where that’s how it works.<p>My impression of developing countries was that police are vicious, brutal, and corrupt by default. As opposed to the US where bad cops are the exception. And they have very little oversight. Which countries are you talking about where that&#x27;s not the case? &gt; I&#x27;d lose my mind if some swine pointed a gun at my child.<p>I understand the sentiment. I really do. But that is the wrong response when someone is pointing a gun at you. That’s how’s your child loses their father or mother.<p>Don’t forget that police are trained to shoot to kill. There is no training for “shoot to injure” ... the logic being that if you are injured, you can reach into your clothes and pull out a gun, potentially killing the officer who shot you. I appreciate your sentiment, but, as a former Marine with a little combat experience, I probably have a bit more understanding of this type of situation than you (statistically likely). You say it&#x27;s the &quot;wrong response&quot;; I&#x27;ve seen people who have their families put under threat of death; they actually lose it. It&#x27;s not some choice of bravado, not an honor thing, it&#x27;s a physiological reaction to the extreme emotional stress.<p>You may not understand this type of situation, but I&#x27;ve experienced the feeling of going from a safe, comfortable environment to being in pain and seeing friends hurt, all in a split second; even with Marine Corps training, I was ready to snap. My hands were shaking, there was a roaring in my ears, and I was ready to kill the first threat I saw. That situation, in my home, with my family? It isn&#x27;t a choice. We are biological creatures, and there are some reactions that are just biological. It&#x27;s easy to play armchair general and discount all of the human factors. &gt; We are biological creatures, and there are some reactions that are just biological<p>I understand and I assume you have weapons stashed around your residence in case of these kind of encounters.<p>But this family almost certainly did not. If you watch the video, the gun is pointing upstairs, presumably at the husband and children. I doubt the husband has a firearm handy or a means to defend himself for this situation.<p>So his emotional response to attack without proper weaponry is foolish, unless on the odd chance he’s a trained ninja like you :) I think I did a poor job in highlighting the meat of my response from the rest. The point is not about what I would do, or could do, in a situation like that. The point was that people don&#x27;t behave rationally in situations like that; not because they&#x27;re fools, or weak, or immature; it&#x27;s because they are having a physiological response to extreme emotional trauma. If they don&#x27;t, they are textbook sociopaths, or have been put through large amounts of emotional conditioning.<p>Read through your comment:\n&quot;I doubt the husband has a firearm handy or a means to defend himself for this situation. So his emotional response to attack without proper weaponry is foolish&quot;<p>This point of view is speculative, it doesn&#x27;t come from experience (or even a basic psychological understanding). People do NOT function that way. Maybe they do when playing Call of Duty or watching a Die Hard movie, but not in real life. I can&#x27;t really impart what it feels like in that sort of situation, but I hope you never have to experience it. You end up needing therapy. Yep, the correct response is comply, document everything, hire a civil lawyer. Cities spend 10s to 100s of millions to settle police lawsuits every year. Might as well get your cut. If some insane police officer with no trigger discipline is dumb enough to point his gun at an unarmed child, the child&#x27;s parents are justified in shooting him dead. If the officer reacts with lethal force, he should be charged with murder. &gt;There is no training for “shoot to injure” ... the logic being that if you are injured, you can reach into your clothes and pull out a gun, potentially killing the officer who shot you.<p>I&#x27;d have thought the logic is, &quot;If you want to injure, use a baton.  Guns are tools for killing.&quot;<p>Teaching &quot;shoot to injure&quot; would be reckless considering the chances a &quot;wounding&quot; shot ends up killing somebody. Most police (and self-defense) training is &quot;shoot to stop&quot;. That’s a euphemism. I understand where you’re coming from, but it really isn’t.<p>Most training is to shoot “center of mass”. That often kills, yes, but if the goal was to kill (or even kill quickly), tactics like the “Mozambique drill” - two shots center of mass and one shot to the head - would be standard. It’s not. It’s specifically used as training for exceptional circumstances. Exactly. Law enforcement or self-defense training does not train to put a security round into the head of a downed subject (shoot to kill training), but rather to summon&#x2F;render medical aid once the threat has been stopped (shoot to stop training). What’s wrong with just doing as the police say? &gt;I&#x27;d lose my mind if some swine pointed a gun at my child.<p>How to avoid this:<p>1) When they show up at your house with a search warrant, let them execute it.<p>That&#x27;s it.

I do statistics in a software program designed basically to do all that stuff for you by clicking stuff.”<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s the data scientist to hire: someone who &quot;clicks stuff.&quot;<p>Additional quote from article:<p>&quot;In an affidavit signed by FDLE investigator Noel Pratt on Dec. 3, he concluded the email message was sent to approximately 1,750 accounts before it was discovered. Pratt said in the affidavit that he tracked down the IP address of the computer associated with the email and it directed him to Jones’ home address, which he said was probable cause to conduct a search of her property and seize her computers.&quot;<p>This person is not trustworthy, or qualified as a source.  None of her colleagues have corroborated her claims.  She was put on a pedestal by a media that desperately wants to attack any governor, especially a Trump ally, who wanted to open their state back up rather than go the lockdown model.  It&#x27;s that simple.  I&#x27;m not a DeSantis fan at all, but if an anti-vaxxer was crusading against him, I wouldn&#x27;t give them a platform just to get to him.  I&#x27;d think about the implications of putting an alarmist with no scientific credentials to speak of on a platform as a weapon against him.  She&#x27;s a GIS specialist with no coding skills.  How exactly does that make her qualified to talk about infectious disease data publicly, and to unilaterally change the dashboard she was tasked with maintaining without consulting her boss and&#x2F;or team? (that&#x27;s why they fired her)<p>We can talk all day about the appropriate police response to this kind of crime, but she&#x27;s not credible as an expert.  She&#x27;s a click jocky who is skilled with Tableau, Qlik, and ESRI.  And she&#x27;s engaged in a deceptive charade of labelling herself a whistleblower, down to the tweets leaving out key information. Give a bunch of high school bullies a few hours of training and all the &#x27;tacticool&#x27; gear they want (vests, drop leg holsters, armored vehicles, ar&#x27;s etc) and it&#x27;s hard to imagine any other result.  Poor muzzle discipline, innocents (and dogs) killed, the list goes on. Gun ownership is very common in this country, and anyone on the other side of any door can have one.<p>So I can get that part.<p>Pointing a gun, loaded or not, at someone else should be a serious crime though! And there probably is, but cops can safely break most laws. While it is true that a lot of people own guns, there still needs to be a good reason to draw your weapon. Drawing a weapon is escalating the situation. Full stop. By drawing a weapon you indicate that you are willing to kill another person. There is a clear difference between <i>having</i> a weapon and positioning one&#x27;s team in case weapons are drawn, but the police have a higher standard than the citizens. As a trained professional you have a higher expectation to remain cool and collected in a stressful situation (that&#x27;s why you train. That&#x27;s what you train for).<p>Guns should not be drawn unless there is a reasonable suspicion of a threat. What I tried to say in my OP is that there appears to be no indication of a reasonable suspicion of a threat.<p>As for gun ownership stats, I think many will be surprised with some of the data points: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;264932&#x2F;percentage-americans-own-guns.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;264932&#x2F;percentage-americans-own...</a> I imagine police officers are trained to have their guns drawn any time they enter a home where they cannot see the occupants.<p>There is not enough time to draw and shoot if the occupant runs out with his gun.<p>By the way, you are absolutely right about what it means to have a gun drawn: they are indicating that they are willing to kill. That&#x27;s how they are trained. &gt; Gun ownership is very common in this country, and anyone on the other side of any door can have one.\n&gt; So I can get that part.<p>Its completely unacceptable.  Police don&#x27;t pull over drivers for speeding with a gun drawn.  However, anyone in Florida may be armed and you cannot reasonably argue that the drivers are cool headed.<p>This overreaction is unprofessional, dangerous, and thuggish.<p>We have a law that we may not be required to quarter soldiers, perhaps a better law would have been to make it illegal to enter private property without consent armed. &gt; We have a law that we may not be required to quarter soldiers, perhaps a better law would have been to make it illegal to enter private property without consent armed.<p>I believe that a warrant gives them this right. But the give a bit more nuance there is a difference in entering armed vs drawn. We should definitely have a high standard for when weapons are allowed to be drawn. It is in fact the police who are in a position of power, so they have the higher standard to meet. With a pulled over car you can see the driver, and part of  US driver&#x27;s ed is to keep your hands visible to the officer.<p>When you break down a door, you can&#x27;t know what&#x27;s waiting on the other side. There is the concept of the Castle Doctrine, where you are allowed to use deadly force (within reason) to defend yourself and your family when someone attempts to assault you within your own home. Not all states have it but regardless, it is null and void when it comes to the police.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not sure why this is being downvoted? We&#x27;re discussing gun ownership in America, when it is legally allowable to use said firearms and the fact that none of that matters when it comes to Police entering your home, all in the context of police acting like the Gestapo at this woman&#x27;s home. For any normal citizen, pointing a gun at someone unprovoked is considered assault at best. I think the law is a bit different when that someone shows up at your door or is inside your house. Isn&#x27;t that the essence of the Breonna Jones case? I was reading of a different case recently too.<p>If they&#x27;ve announced that they&#x27;re law enforcement, it&#x27;s a bad idea though. You may be in the right if you&#x27;re just armed and not pointing it, but being in the right never protects you. The law actually isn&#x27;t different.<p>Cops just have qualified immunity and have shown they throw hissy fit little tantrums if a DA holds them responsible for being the worthless sacks of shit that they are. That they sometimes are. I agree that good cops do exist. Show me a cop that, for example, wants justice for Breonna Taylor, and I&#x27;ll agree they&#x27;re one of the good ones. But without being able to clear what is actually a <i>very low bar</i> for belief in American ideals and the rule of law, most of them are part of a criminal conspiracy. Yeah, I bet if someone came over and beat the shit out of you for only an hour a day, you&#x27;d be correcting people that the person is only sometimes an asshole. Florida makes it very easy to own and conceal a handgun.  I guess that leads to both politeness, and caution. That&#x27;s not the real relationship tree. Mass gun ownership leads to fear. Fear may lead to politeness and caution, but only because of the fear. It may also lead to a &#x27;fight or flight&#x27; type response, and things might escalate quickly beyond where anyone wanted them to be...<p>If you want to structure society around fear, that is (I guess) a country&#x27;s prerogative, but it&#x27;s not something I (as a non-American) would ever support. You have made some lovely statements. You have nothing to back them. They will play well here. This coming from a person who lives in Florida and has a carry conceal permit. wasn&#x27;t this story about the police being polite, and then later entering... cautiously? This hasn&#x27;t been my experience fwiw as someone who moved from a non-gun country to the US. To be honest where I live (Montana) guns really aren&#x27;t a problem. At least not the kind of problem that makes it a win to require Democrat candidates to support additional gun control measures. I think it&#x27;s not unrealistic to imagine that we could completely dispense with the crazy Republicans if only democrats would drop gun control, it&#x27;s such a wedge issue. Imagine that: Trump would never have happened, in exchange for not pursuing gun laws that probably wouldn&#x27;t have achieved anything. Ha! It leads to verbal confrontations escalating to murders instead of fistfights. Mass gun ownership also increases gun ownership among fools and incompetents who leave their guns in places where they can be stolen and introduced into the black market. Or even where 4 year olds discharge the parents weapons into their 5 year old siblings - accidentally more or less. I’ve seen a few cases like that NYC makes it very easy to own and cancel a handgun. I&#x27;ve never heard it of it&#x27;s residents being polite. I though NYC is a very difficult place to own and conceal a handgun (legally). Oh, it’s impossible to do legally.<p>Which doesn’t stop NYC having many, many guns being concealed carry. Because of you are looking to commit violent crimes, what’s another felony vs. having the power of life and death over victims?<p>And if you are a likely target of violent crimes, what’s a concealed carry felony vs. being dead or having a family member assaulted or murdered because you couldn’t stop it? Half of what police are trained to do is violence-based. And we need people like that, for violent situations. But we don’t need that for a &#x2F;TON&#x2F; of basic situations. We have armed warriors giving speeding tickets and expecting them to not be warriors. Where are the administrators who aren’t the warriors? In that vein, there&#x27;s actually an experiment in progress where cops are not always dispatched but instead a paramedic and social worker are sent. Turns out they can resolve many issues.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denverpost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;06&#x2F;denver-star-program-mental-health-police&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denverpost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;06&#x2F;denver-star-program-me...</a> &gt; I&#x27;m always amazed at how often cops approach every day tasks with weapons drawn.<p>That is IMO a side-effect of the (from an European POV) absolutely mind-boggling, ridiculous sentencing of criminals in the US. Here in Germany, when a drug smuggler gets caught, they can expect four, five years behind bars. Not worth to shoot the cop that just stopped your car full with meth and make a life sentence out of it for murder.<p>In the US however? Decades, sometimes <i>centuries</i> behind bars. Given that perspective, it does make sense for a criminal to shoot that traffic cop - the chance to get away and escape a death in prison is non-zero.<p>Add to that the fact that there are more guns than people in the US, plus extremely lax carrying laws, and &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.<p>The result are (rightfully, I have to admit) afraid and thus extremely trigger-happy cops.<p>If the US wants to get rid of trigger-happy cops they have to get the gun problem and sentencing under control first. Eh, don&#x27;t side with cops. They have no legal obligation to do anything. They know this. So they pick their battles where they know they can kill a few people and get away with it. When it comes to actually having a chance at saving lives, they run away and hide, and get rewarded for it.<p>See the recent-ish school shooting in Florida where the on-duty cop ran away like a baby and let children die. Brian Miller. Still has his job. No one gives a shit.<p>Cops in the US are cowards who don&#x27;t deserve to arm with a super soaker. &gt; In the US however? Decades, sometimes centuries behind bars. Given that perspective, it does make sense for a criminal to shoot that traffic cop - the chance to get away and escape a death in prison is non-zero.<p>Three-strikes sentencing can also exacerbate this - escalating minor drug possession to potentially life-ending prison sentence. Those cops are choosing to be the enforcers of the laws&#x2F;sentences which you are suggesting are unjust. Yes, and we voted Biden in as President.<p>(No I didn&#x27;t vote for Trump) The training is a huge one. Patriot act on Netflix (clearly 100% unbiased and best news source ever) even talked about exactly that.<p>His joke was to the effect; imagine airplane pilots spending 90% of training learning how to use the ejection seat and a couple hours learning to fly &gt; <i>I&#x27;m always amazed at how often cops approach every day tasks with weapons drawn. Reading the article (and being aware of the ongoing story) there&#x27;s no indication (to me) that there would be any hostility facing the officers.</i><p>It&#x27;s less amazing when you start to realize that police are cowardly and most are dumb enough to think that having a gun out will protect them.<p>It&#x27;s currently a side life goal of mine to get the IANA to assign me acab::&#x2F;16. I agree. And the responses so far indicate either cynicism or justification. Neither is useful imho.<p>Police _are_ overly militarized and overly aggressive. We should be able to have a conversation in a healthy democracy about appropriate rules of engagement and escalation.<p>Personally, I think it can be traced directly to the failed war on drugs. and indirectly, to the wars on terror creating both an excuse and a market for police weaponization. when you insist as a population to the right to have guns, then you have to be prepared that people need to treat you as if you have a weapon and, at times, will make mistakes.  It&#x27;s one of those weird rights that people want so they can &quot;defend&quot; themselves, but actually makes society as a whole a lot more dangerous. The police went through the house with their weapons drawn because they had a search warrant that was being ignored.<p>They spent almost half of an hour politely requesting that these people allow them to carry it out, and these people refused to comply with what amounts to a legal court order.<p>A functioning state <i>requires</i> that the state has a monopoly on violence.  If you are ordered to allow the police to seize some of your property, and you refuse, force will be escalated within the limits of the law until you the property is taken.  That is a <i>good</i> thing.  If the police show up at your house with a warrant, COMPLY WITH THEM.  You aren&#x27;t going to win a physical battle against them because, again, they have an ultimate monopoly on violence and the only way to change that is going to be the creation of a new state. I sort of don&#x27;t want a comment like this, that isn&#x27;t relevant, at the top. Like you can briefly say you empathize with her position and that obviously the police are misbehaving. But what we all really want is the Republicans to pay for suppressing data, because obviously Florida is in much worse shape than anyone wants to admit, it couldn&#x27;t be any other way, so whose head will roll for the inevitable cover-up, and if not, why was such a cover-up lawful? For a person like this, can&#x27;t they direct her to step outside where they can pat her down and then do the search? Without their guns drawn? But the chance of getting away with killing a few people becomes non-existent if you actually try to do something sane. * American cops &quot;that there would be any hostility facing the officers&quot;<p>From [1]: &quot;Plessinger said Jones refused to answer the door for 20 minutes and hung up on agents. Jones eventually let the agents into the home, she said.<p>Her family was upstairs when agents entered, Plessinger said.<p>The 31-second video Jones posted on Twitter shows agents entering her home with their guns drawn. Jones tells the officers that her husband and two children are upstairs as they direct her outside of the house.<p>One of the agents points his gun toward the stairwell. An officer shouts, “Police, come down now.”<p>As the video ends, Jones yells, “He just pointed a gun at my children.” The video does not show any children, or agents pointing guns at any children. FDLE said agents didn’t point guns at anyone.&quot;<p>...<p>There&#x27;s a couple things missing from your comment:<p>1) The person refused to answer the door for 20 minutes, which is definitely a form of resistance and an indicator of possible problems, at which frankly, SOP probably kicks in and &#x27;guns are drawn&#x27; at the point of entry.<p>2) The cops deny pointing guns at anyone, including children.<p>So frankly, that seems very reasonable.<p>While all of the journalists seem to want to recount only one side of the story, and only even part of it - is frankly deeply troubling, and it&#x27;s misinformation of a serious kind. Right now we are getting really spooked about &#x27;someone&#x27; misinforming American about election results, and attacking the integrity of the press, so I&#x27;m perennially amazed that journos want to avoid the important details that provide context.<p>Finally, remember there&#x27;s SOP (standard operating procedure). There are a lot of guns in America, and people are pretty violent in general in terms of trying to get away, or to assail cops in the process. Most warrants served are probably not for &#x27;hacking&#x27; rather more violent actions, and there may very well be established SOP about when to draw and not.<p>If the incident basically amounted to:\n1) No answer at door\n2) Cops enter with guns draw, point only upstairs urging people to come down.<p>Then it&#x27;s completely reasonable.<p>Obviously, nobody should be pointing guns at regular people for white collar crimes, but as usual, all this might have been avoided if the individual  answered the door and &#x27;used her words&#x27;.<p>Also, the &#x27;big story&#x27; here is the possibility of someone being harassed for whistle-blowing, which is disconcerting, but that&#x27;s not so much relevant when worrying about the specific facts of an altercation.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower-search-warrant-20201207-rapzkgm7fnbujlhwzadunciigu-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-whistleblower...</a> When you give a cop a hammer and only a hammer they will view every problem as a nail.<p>This is what Defund the Police is about. Its not about getting rid of cops, its about providing the right resources and tools and staff for the type of job they have. Funny enough, training is expensive and most of the issues are from a lack of training. I think removing funding will only make things worse. Evidence doesn&#x27;t seem to indicate that, given funding, the police will turn it into meaningful training: it seems to go elsewhere.  From [1], a sample:<p>&gt; We found that, in a two week period at the beginning of June, when the anti-racism protests began, New York City spent $115 million on police overtime, which was over four times what the city spent in the same period last year.<p>&gt; $14 million went to new locker rooms. $64 million went to motor vehicles and $104 million was planned for police training. During that training, 60 hours are spent on firearm skills while just eight hours are spent on conflict management.<p>So the training given to police is a fraction of money spent on annual overtime, and the training that is received goes towards increasing violence.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;the-real-cost-of-police-nypd-actually-10-billion-year-2020-8?op=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;the-real-cost-of-police-nypd...</a> In 2019, the NYPD spent $230 million on lawsuit settlements, including $95 million on police misconduct alone.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comptroller.nyc.gov&#x2F;reports&#x2F;annual-claims-report&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comptroller.nyc.gov&#x2F;reports&#x2F;annual-claims-report&#x2F;</a>. Yeah, the biggest cost by far in any department is personnel, especially unionized personnel. Remove funding for military equipment, restrict gun carrying by police to special teams, stop using militarized police as a response to nonviolent crime.  These are all necessary changes that are part of defunding the police. The military equipment is free under the federal grants. Military equipment is <i>provided</i> under the federal grants.  It is only &quot;free&quot; in the sense that it isn&#x27;t being paid for by local taxes.  That means that local police need to be defunded of federal funds as well as local funds. It&#x27;s not really federal funds either. It&#x27;s surplus equiptment. Perhaps there&#x27;s a more accurate term rather than defund. Sounds like it would be more socially responsible to decommission it properly, rather than using untrained, irresponsible, and reckless police as a dumping ground for surplus equipment. What peices of this surplus equiptment are socially irresponsible? This equipment is defensive, administrative, or less lethal. If anything, it should provide more options before things turn lethal. Defensive equipment promotes escalation, as there is less worry of harm.  Defensive equipment promotes escalation, as it is a social signal that you come prepared to enact violence.  Less lethal equipment promotes escalation, as it has a perception of being harmless and more acceptable to use in non-violent situations.  The solution is to stop escalating, not to provide more methods by which to escalate while decreasing the risks involved in escalating.<p>Also, you know, tanks.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;towns-dont-need-tanks-they-have-them\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;towns-dont-need-...</a> &gt; Defensive equipment promotes escalation, as there is less worry of harm.<p>I think there&#x27;s a conversation about law enforcement and civil rights that people in the US need to have. But its awfully hard to have a real conversation when people don&#x27;t want police to use lethal force and also don&#x27;t want cops to have access to things that allow them to do their job with less reliance on lethal force.<p>&gt; Also, you know, tanks. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;towns-dont-need-\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;towns-dont-need-</a>...<p>Actually those are not tanks. And the US military has no problem using .50 cal on personnel. Which are just nitpicks but they illustrate how hard it is to talk about these subjects when the people making the criticisms are so profoundly ignorant about the facts of the matter. Community trust and support is what lets police be able to police without lethal force.  Treating it as a war between police and other citizens destroys that trust.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peelian_principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peelian_principles</a> I can agree with that. How do you propose to deal with the criminal element? &quot;Defensive equipment promotes escalation, as there is less worry of harm.&quot;<p>Yeah, and safer cars increase reckless driving for the same reason...<p>&quot;Defensive equipment promotes escalation, as it is a social signal that you come prepared to enact violence.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s being used in response to a suspect&#x27;s social cue that they are there to commit violence. What should we do, just lay down?<p>&quot;Less lethal equipment promotes escalation, as it has a perception of being harmless and more acceptable to use in non-violent situations.&quot;<p>This is false. The use of less lethal force is not viewed as harmless and any training will show that. That training will also contain use of force education. I&#x27;m not aware of any of it being free. (at least not in TX)<p>They pay for it and in fact if they dont USE it, it will be confiscated and not refunded.<p>so not only do they get very big brutal hammers, but for contractual reasons they are FORCED to use them or lose they money they paid for them. Its not free, it&#x27;s expensive to maintain and deploy. The vehicles, sure. But they get orher, simple equipment too. But what is the purpose of an MRAP (for one example)?<p>In the incredibly rare event you have an active terrorist attack and can move the MRAP to it before it&#x27;s over, it may provide the benefit of movable cover.<p>The rest of the time you have to park it (in two parking spaces likely), train people with it,  fuel it, clean it, maintain it. It&#x27;s just a huge distraction that sends a terrible message to the people you are supposedly serving. I&#x27;m a person that it serves and don&#x27;t see it sending a bad message. They can use it in inclement weather to deliver supplies, such as after hurricanes. They also tend to deploy the armor at events that are high risk prior to an attack. An MRAP is not going to be any better at delivering supplies than a few 4x4 trucks.  They&#x27;re not built for cargo and they&#x27;re very heavy.<p>And what events in the US are at high risk of attack by IEDs and mines? They have better ground clearance and should still be operational after say a tornado or hurricane. A truck with high ground clearance costs more than an order of magnitude less than an MRAP to maintain. Do you have the numbers for that?<p>Also, a regular truck will not stand up to storm debris in strong winds. it allows LEOs and medical personnel to approach an area that is in danger of lethal force by criminals. Training and equipping peace officers to de-escalate situations is far cheaper and better for the general population than the hundreds of millions in excessive force and wrongful death lawsuits that are paid out of our taxes.<p>NYC alone has dropped over $300M on settling lawsuits due to their poor training over the last 5 years[0]<p>I know a couple current and former NYPD officers and the amount of times I’ve been told of how a routine mental health check up turned into 4+ cops beating the crap out of an unarmed person \nin their own home would likely surprise most people who aren’t familiar with how brutal the police in the USA are.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;31&#x2F;city-payouts-in-nypd-misconduct-cases-up-by-nearly-30m&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;31&#x2F;city-payouts-in-nypd-misconduc...</a> It&#x27;s not necessarily a &#x27;lack of training&#x27; so much as &#x27;money spent on irrelevant training instead of what they need&#x27;. Either police departments can agree that not all members of the police need to carry guns and be trained to shoot, and redirect training funds from weapons to de-escalation and assistance - or we must move the funding away from the police department to a different department that will do so. &quot;...or we must move the funding away from the police department to a different department that will do so.&quot;<p>And then you still have armed police without training. There seems to be a weird attitude in the US that the police are some sort of independent entity, and the most the state can do is reduce its tribute to them. This is a really odd approach, and doesn’t really have a parallel elsewhere; successful police reform had generally involved changes of leadership, independent misconduct commissions, and increased consequences. They are usually unionized. This mandates that many changes opposed by the union (misconduct commissions and increased consequences) would have to be approved&#x2F;negotiated by them or else risk a strike. Those negotiations tend to cut out any meaningful changes that threaten their autonomy&#x2F;privileges. I think it’s more misallocation of training than lack of training per se. Not enough emphasis on deescalation training. Defunding means that they have to rely more on civil asset forfeiture. This is probably not the result you intended. The first step of defunding should be that police doesn&#x27;t get to keep the spoils of civil asset forfeiture. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2020&#x2F;dec&#x2F;04&#x2F;barack-obama-lesson-british-left-words-matter-defund-the-police-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2020&#x2F;dec&#x2F;04&#x2F;barack...</a><p>I suspect your comment is greyed out because of this term. Such a fucking stupid slogan, when you turn off people and then try to clarify &quot;It means...&quot; to an audience that&#x27;s mostly stopped listening. Again, &quot;defund the police&quot; is a motte and bailey argument: its activists will claim it&#x27;s all about reform, but  once they have your attention and know they won&#x27;t be substantively debated, watch that word &quot;defund&quot; turn quickly to &quot;abolish&quot;. And no solutions will be forthcoming about how to deal with criminals. I&#x27;m not amazed, because police are put in completely unknown situations with people they&#x27;ve never met, and know absolutely nothing about.<p>People&#x27;s public personas really aren&#x27;t a guarantee that they&#x27;ll act a certain way on their property, especially when they are not doing something voluntarily.<p>Combine that with the fact being that gun ownership is a Constitutional right--that means the chance that anyone can have a gun is above 0.  And various attributes of anyone that might determine whether or not someone is about to retaliate are extremely unknowable without long observation times.  There&#x27;s no possible way to quickly ascertain someone&#x27;s proclivity to violence, agitation level, emotional state, number of guns they really have on hand, willingness to use them, etc.  People will act differently outside of a public setting like work, on a TV show, etc.<p>So as long as guns are as easily available as they are currently, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect a law officer to start the interaction in this way which is a manner that protects the officer the most. You are aware cops have absolutely no obligation to enforce the law, right?<p>So you or me entering this woman&#x27;s home with guns drawn - we have the same obligation to be there as a cop.<p>This whole &quot;oh but the cops are scared for their life&quot; crap needs to stop. They have no obligation to do anything, so anytime they do, it&#x27;s their choice. Just as much their choice as you or me busting into a home with guns drawn.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t be sitting here sympathizing with how a random burglar is totally justified in entering a home with a weapon drawn because the homeowner could be armed.<p>Why do you do the same with cops?<p>Edit: to summarize my point: cops have no obligation to be there, so if their solution is to enter with guns drawn and barking orders, we shouldn&#x27;t try to sympathize with that behavior. We should tell them to stay at home and cuddle a teddy bear instead. A lot more people would be alive today if we quit making excuses for why cops are so eager to kill people. &gt; You are aware cops have absolutely no obligation to enforce the law, right?<p>This is a search warrant situation.  Obligations exist in this situation - to the judge, court process, and CO.  If you want to debate the obligations to the public or immunity of cops, fine--but this isn&#x27;t like a random traffic stop.  What the police is supposed to do in this situation is very clear--serve warrant, get evidence.<p>&gt; You wouldn&#x27;t be sitting here sympathizing with how a random burglar is totally justified in entering a home with a weapon drawn because the homeowner could be armed.<p>This isn&#x27;t sympathy but just expectation.  You would <i>expect</i> a house invader to be armed for exactly that reason, right?  Similarly, why wouldn&#x27;t you expect a cop to do the same? They have no legal obligation to be there or do that job. If they refuse, there can be no punishment. This has gone to the federal courts, and even the Supreme Court, several times. Cops have absolutely zero legal obligation to enforce the law. There&#x27;s no sense in you even trying to disagree with this because the highest court in the land had consistently declared it as the law.<p>On your second point... I agree? Cops are forcing themselves into people&#x27;s homes with the express intent of fucking shit up, that&#x27;s why they enter armed and dangerous, the same as a thief. Is that what you&#x27;re saying? Because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. Do you sympathize with the thief? I don&#x27;t, the same as I don&#x27;t sympathize with the cop.<p>Edit: to clarify - the cop could be entering the home as a neighbor and a friend, and that&#x27;s what everyone would prefer. Unfortunately, cops decided long ago they&#x27;d rather hold onto their right to kill with no questions asked, so now they&#x27;re no better than a methhead busting down a door. It&#x27;s ultimately their fault for this image, and they&#x27;re the only ones that can fix it. &gt; Cops have absolutely zero legal obligation to enforce the law.<p>Was surprised to learn this is true.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;politics&#x2F;justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;politics&#x2F;justices-rule-po...</a> Of course the cops have an obligation to be there. Regardless of whatever legal principle you&#x27;re referring to states, it will not take long for a police officer to be fired if they refuse to do any work. Read up on Brian Miller in the Parkland shooting. Let children die because he ran away. Still working as a cop. They tried to fire him but can&#x27;t. Laws are enforced at a cop&#x27;s discretion. &gt; it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect a law officer to start the interaction in this way which is a manner that protects the officer the most<p>This mentality is so wrong to me.<p>Yes there is danger associated with entering a home, but if you are not willing to take any risk, don&#x27;t try to be a cop. \nSure, if cops can reduce risk for themselves without increasing it for others, then by all mean they should, I&#x27;m not saying they should be daredevils.<p>But this is different, this is just offloading all the risks from their side onto the citizens.\nA situation that could be minimal risk to everyone (because let&#x27;s not pretend that people shooting at cops entering a home is a usual thing), is now high risk (and traumatic in all cases) for the citizen. I would even wager that the risk for themselves is getting increased over time because of people freaking out more and more seeing a cop with a gun in the US.<p>And let&#x27;s not pretend that cops in the US are well trained, they are so afraid and completly unable to de-escalate a situation that I would have 0 confidence in a cop pulling a gun on me in the US (not saying I would like it anywhere, but I would sure be less freaked out in Europe).<p>This is just plain stupid, it&#x27;s not a necessity of life like you paint it. &gt; And let&#x27;s not pretend that cops in the US are well trained, they are so afraid and completly unable to de-escalate a situation that they I would have 0 confidence in a cop pulling a gun on me in the US (not saying I would like it anywhere, but I would sure be less freaked out in Europe).<p>&gt; The officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a 2016 traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota,[...] clocked more than 100 hours of trainings on topics such as firearms usage, street survival, and the use of force—but had only attended two hours of deescalation training.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;warrior-cop-class-dave-grossman-killology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;warrior-cop-clas...</a> &gt; A situation that could be minimal risk to everyone (because let&#x27;s not pretend that people shooting at cops entering a home is a usual thing), is now high risk (and traumatic in all cases) for the citizen.<p>Well, if you are arresting a person, perhaps there&#x27;s things that can be done, like waiting outside.  How is it supposed to be handled when you have to get evidence?<p>&gt; I would sure be less freaked out in Europe<p>I&#x27;m sure this is an oversimplification but AFAIK states in Europe either have more restrictions on gun ownership or a culture&#x2F;mediascape&#x2F;welfare-state that doesn&#x27;t encourage the desperation&#x2F;antagonism you see in the US. The chance that anyone can have a gun is above 0 everywhere, it&#x27;s a meaningless statement. Sure, the chances are higher in the US than just about everywhere else, so why not just say that.<p>It&#x27;s totally unreasonable for the officers to act this way, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly obvious that escalating to guns drawn makes them any safer. Maybe it does, but maybe it turns them into a threat in the minds of the people they think they are protecting themselves from. &gt; So as long as guns are as easily available as they are currently, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect a law officer to start the interaction in this way which is a manner that protects the officer the most.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is as simple as this. While one should train for the worst possible scenarios one also has to be aware what to reasonably expect. Like the source in my original comment notes, being a police officer is relatively safe. Given those statistics an officer should not view every situation as deadly. Though it is fine for them to be on high alert. It is still something that is often drilled into people during gun training that you should not point a weapon at something you do not <i>intend</i> to destroy. That is rule #1. Officers need to understand that by erring on the side of weapons drawn is equivalent to escalating any given interaction. Is that the mode of failure we want to have in police? &gt; While one should train for the worst possible scenarios one also has to be aware what to reasonably expect<p>Sometimes (I&#x27;m actually going to say most of time) giving the suspect warnings or time isn&#x27;t a good idea.  In the case of collecting evidence that is on computers, this evidence is easily destroyed if someone knows what they are doing and giving the suspect a warning could ultimately result in loss of justice.<p>Therefore, coming in unexpectedly, and performing actions to make sure the suspect does not do anything until the evidence is collected makes sense.  Yes, coming in with guns drawn is scary, etc.  But would knocking on the door and asking for the computers have worked?  It might eventually, after many opportunities for evidence destruction occurred... but which way has a higher chance of working?<p>It&#x27;s useful to note here that I think if you work for the state, you should be held to a higher standard--this is different than working at a private company and embezzlement, stealing, etc.  If you have violated the trust of the citizens of Florida via doing something wrong at your state job, and a judge agrees there is enough probable cause that evidence is on your home computer, isn&#x27;t better that a method of evidence collection is done that is swift and not likely to result in destruction of evidence? If someone more or less commits a crime against the state of Florida, isn&#x27;t that more important than the fear&#x2F;mental health of the individual suspect? &gt; Combine that with the fact being that gun ownership is a Constitutional right--that means the chance that anyone can have a gun is above 0.<p>This chance is always above zero, unless you&#x27;ve just full-body-and-orifice searched the person.<p>I am not american, but isn&#x27;t there some constitutional clause on bodily integrity or something like that? And isn&#x27;t that more important\nthan this right on owning guns&#x2F;pointing guns at people that might own guns, and&#x2F;or carry said guns?<p>&gt; So as long as guns are as easily available as they are currently, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect a law officer to start the interaction in this way which is a manner that protects the officer the most.<p>Going into a home gun-first is something I would expect from armed burglars, not from police that are there for a digital media search warrant.<p>[edit]<p>So, after a search, TIL: the USA does not have constitutional bodily integrity, but does grant you the right to own a gun... <i>What</i> ? <i>&gt; police are put in completely unknown situations with people they&#x27;ve never met, and know absolutely nothing about</i><p>While this is often true, it wasn&#x27;t true in this specific case. The person whose home the cops wanted to search was a former state employee, whose record they had plenty of time to examine prior to going to her home, so she was not an unknown quantity. &gt; I&#x27;m not amazed, because police are put in completely unknown situations with people they&#x27;ve never met, and know absolutely nothing about.<p>In the vast majority of cases, the police <i>choose</i> which situations to enter and how to engage. &gt; a manner that protects the officer the most<p>I doubt this is true. To me it is clear that their demeanor and behavior increases the liklihood of escalation and an incident. People own guns legally in other first world countries and this is a problem fairly unique to the US. &gt; I&#x27;m always amazed at how often cops approach every day tasks with weapons drawn. Reading the article (and being aware of the ongoing story) there&#x27;s no indication (to me) that there would be any hostility facing the officers.<p>Invading someone&#x27;s home isn&#x27;t an every day task. Most people don&#x27;t like that. And since this in the US where potentially anyone could easily have a gun, some will take the opportunity remove the invaders of their house by force, especially if they aren&#x27;t aware or sure it&#x27;s the police. [0]<p>But anyway, I&#x27;m not sure why police should even be the focus of this thread. They&#x27;re just doing their job. The bigger issue I see here is the police have been called to take care of an issue that shouldn&#x27;t require police.<p>0. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Castle_doctrine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Castle_doctrine</a><p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll just add since I&#x27;m getting downvoted to oblivion for saying something that could slightly be viewed as remotely favorable to police: It&#x27;s sad to see this topic hijacked from the focus on Rebekah Jones, where there&#x27;s an actual interesting story here about her work being potentially surpressed, to some unrelated topic about how much force police should use. Something that has been talked about ad nauseam across HN already, and yet this (at this time) is the most upvoted comment. Invading someone’s home with an assault team is unnecessarily aggressive. Police in the US are armed to the teeth, so it’s no wonder they overcompensate with aggression.<p>Of course, if they received a tip or confirmed that someone in the building is armed and dangerous, then that’s a different story. But simply going in with guns drawn in every single situation is simply unacceptable. Many warrants are served everyday. I would say it&#x27;s an common task from a LEO perspective, but not from a citizen&#x27;s perspective. Police have to announce their presence. You would think also just from common sense and context that this was something that could have been done with one officer politely knocking on the door, knowing there is a zero percent chance that there would be someone hold up with a gun trained on the other side of the door in this instance. I mean it&#x27;s not like this data scientist was some drug lord or arms dealer with a history of resorting to violence. The guns were for theatrics and nothing more. Lots of people jumping to conclusions one way or the other here, but keep in mind a few things.<p>#1 The police had a warrant. That means they had to have a certain amount of evidence to present to a judge. &quot;She is a disgruntled former employee with an axe to grind&quot; is probably not enough to get a warrant. Server logs with an IP address would hold up in court.<p>#2 Pointing guns at clearly non-aggressive people and particularly kids is bullshit in general. The PD says she hung up on them and knocked on the door for 20 minutes. Maybe BS cover up, but if true, might explain the seemingly over-aggressive entry.<p>Not jumping to conclusions, but sometimes decent people do stupid things. For further context, this is the message that she&#x27;s accused of sending:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s time to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don&#x27;t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it&#x27;s too late.<p>That&#x27;s literally it. When I hear &quot;disgruntled former employee&quot; I think of phishing for credentials or threatening former coworkers, in this case the terms &quot;whistleblower&quot; and &quot;civil disobedience&quot; seem more appropriate. I&#x27;m not sold that what she did was a terrible crime. I do think it was foolish and likely pointless, but not something which merits police pointing guns at her kids and going to prison. A disgruntled former employee allegedly accessed the former employers system to send an unauthorized emergency message. That’s illegal and it doesn’t matter if it’s the Florida Department of Health, Google, or McDonalds.<p>Creating your own dashboard and fighting your former employer’s data is much more like whistleblowing or fighting the system. Hopefully these are just allegations and she can get good lawyers. Whistleblowing is often illegal. Civil disobedience is, by definition, illegal. Actions can be both illegal and morally&#x2F;ethically admirable--hopefully we can all agree on that. It’s not often illegal for public employees. Most of the time there are specific Whitleblower statues. She falls into the one for Florida.<p>Prong 1: Any violation or suspected violation of any federal, state, or local law, rule, or regulation committed by an employee or agent of an agency or independent contractor which creates and present a substantial and specific danger to the public’s health, safety, or welfare; and&#x2F;or<p>Prong 2: Any act or suspected act of gross mismanagement, malfeasance, misfeasance, gross waste of public funds, suspected or actual Medicaid fraud or abuse, or gross neglect of duty committed by an employee or agent of an agency or independent contractor.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.floridalaborlawyer.com&#x2F;what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-whistleblower-against-a-public-employer-in-florida&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.floridalaborlawyer.com&#x2F;what-does-it-mean-to-be-a...</a> #1 seems like a fairly optimistic interpretation of how the system works in practice.<p>Re #2, &quot;sometimes decent people do stupid things&quot;: these &quot;decent people&quot; have been doing these &quot;stupid things&quot; habitually, systematically, across the nation, for decades. This isn&#x27;t some one-off incident, this is the typical procedure. &quot;Decent people do stupid things&quot; when oversight is lax, accountability is thin, wrong is not punished, and right is not highlighted.<p>All of these factors are the result of poor institutional control, and a lack of capacity of institutional leaders to incentivize good behavior and eradicate bad behavior.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to pull a gun on an unarmed child in a household of people who have demonstrated no danger to the police executing the warrant, even if it took forever to enter the property.

Wasn&#x27;t trying to justify it. I wasn&#x27;t going after you, apologies if it came off that way. My frustration is aimed at the system which tacitly consents to needless police aggression.<p>When I read about police behavior I am always reminded of Dr. Zimbardo&#x27;s suggestion that systems may be corrupted not by bad apples, but rather by a bad barrel that damages otherwise healthy apples within. Your comment about decent people hits near the same concept. No worries, I can see how you could read it as justifying their actions. I was just trying to point out that she likely made things worse.<p>I wish our police forces could be much more like the British where only a small percentage of officers are armed. The over-abundance of weapons here makes that exceedingly difficult, but it would be nice.<p>Certainly situations like this where the probability of violent resistance is so small should merit unarmed response, but that&#x27;s just not the way we do things. Just because they have a warrant does not mean they should be going in with weapons drawn even if they were made to sit around for 20 minutes while the innocent person decided what do to.<p>And once they had taken violent charge of that innocent person they had no business lurking in the family dwelling with weapons drawn menacing people that were not even listed on that warrant.<p>You are making a very thin apologium for appalling behaviour. &gt; Just because they have a warrant does not mean they should be going in with weapons drawn even if they were made to sit around for 20 minutes while the innocent person decided what do to.<p>Agree.<p>&gt; You are making a very thin apologium for appalling behaviour.<p>Wasn&#x27;t my intent, but I can see how you would read it that way. #2 acting aggressively simply because someone didn&#x27;t comply is an abuse of power. The only justifiable reason to draw their weapons is if the occupants were viewed as a threat. To threaten as retaliation for non compliance is fucking horse shit. &gt;  <i>Server logs with an IP address would hold up in court.</i><p>TIL I can frame somebody by breaking their wifi password and doing some crimes.  Cool. Well I meant the IP was enough for getting a warrant.

(Rebekah&#x27;s computers were confiscated, as an example.) Being unresponsive doesn’t warrant having your life threatened. Why do people think this? It’s BS either way. It&#x27;s possible the guns were not point at them but were in a low ready too. There are home security videos that you can watch in the article. I&#x27;ll have to watch that.<p>Edit:\nWatched it, but did not see guns being pointed at anyone. And they don&#x27;t show any guns being pointed at anybody.

It doesn&#x27;t show people upstairs in that video.

Why did they need to do that?  Why would they have any reason to believe anyone in the house was a violent threat?<p>Come in with the damn guns holstered.  It&#x27;s some scientist&#x27;s house, where her kids live.  Not a fucking prepper compound. Do you know if they have guns in the house or if they are violent? This is standard procedure if they were noncompliant. No harm was done, so I don&#x27;t see why this is being discussed. If they had thought there was a chance of violence, they would have been much more forceful. &gt; No harm was done, so I don&#x27;t see why this is being discussed<p>Come on now. If you can&#x27;t look at events this year and understand why people are frustrated&#x2F;scared about a situation like this, then that&#x27;s willful ignorance.<p>Is it reasonable for LE to come into certain situations preemptively prepared for violence (gun draw in tight quarters)? I think yes. Is this one? Hell no They&#x27;re prepared to defend themselves because the individual was non-compliant for 20 minutes so they don&#x27;t know if the people in the residence were setting up an ambush. I believe it&#x27;s willful ignorance to ignore the facts of the case. Have you ever educated yourself on police training and tactics? So coming in with guns drawn and covering their arcs as they move through the building is okay even if they thought there was no chance of violence? The fact that no one got shot this time makes it ok for this to be SOP?<p>You seem to have made a lot of posts on this thread about how law enforcement should behave and the tactics they employ. What experience with law enforcement or the military do you have? If you don&#x27;t have direct experience, what are you basing these comments on? Which one said they thought there was no chance of violence?<p>I am trained in a law enforcement program and do self study (more than many officers do) on tactics and the law. &gt; Which one said they thought there was no chance of violence?<p>You implied it. &quot;If they had thought there was a chance of violence, they would have been much more forceful.&quot;<p>I feel like we&#x27;re going to continue to disagree here but I do want to thank you for contributing your viewpoint to the discussion. I should have worded it better as high chance of violence.<p>Same to you. &gt; This is standard procedure if they were noncompliant<p>Laws differ greatly across the US as to this. I am unfamiliar with the laws and procedures of this particular jurisdiction though.<p>&gt; No harm was done<p>Though everyone is different, pointing guns at kids is very likely far from harmless, no matter the firearm operator. As we have seen very much in 2020, law enforcement makes mistakes all the time (to be generous). I know of no laws that would prevent clearing a house they way they did.<p>If you have a mother acting illogically and emotionally, then I would say that is what would cause the harm. Kids will respond the way they think they are supposed to respond based on the response of others. If the mother remains calm and tells them everything was fine and normal, then there should be no harm. &gt; If the mother remains calm and tells them everything was fine and normal, then there should be no harm.<p>Kids vary a lot, but I&#x27;ve not seen a kid that ever behaved in such a way.

The state epidemiologist asked her department to temporarily remove one data field from the public report while they verified some data. Then, they asked it to be re-enabled a few hours later.<p>From what I can tell, Rebekah&#x27;s supervisor didn&#x27;t mention the reason for removing the data, he just told her to remove it. She told him it was &quot;the wrong call&quot;, but did it anyway. He then told her to add the data back a few hours later, which she did.<p>So, it looks like she got the wrong end of the stick about deleting data, and was then fired for insubordination. Apparently she has also has a criminal history including battery against a police officer and sexual cyberstalking of her ex-boyfriend.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tampabay.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;health&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;florida-health-department-officials-told-manager-to-delete-coronavirus-data-before-reassigning-her-emails-show&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tampabay.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;health&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;florida-heal...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lsureveille.com&#x2F;daily&#x2F;crime-briefs-student-charged-with-three-counts-of-drug-possession&#x2F;article_14076f2e-3368-11e6-a129-2717ab6bb2be.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lsureveille.com&#x2F;daily&#x2F;crime-briefs-student-charg...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tallahasseereports.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;rebekah-jones-firing-is-the-covid-clickbait-the-media-dreams-of-but-its-all-fake&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tallahasseereports.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;rebekah-jones-firi...</a> If you want to dispute the facts go ahead, but don&#x27;t bother with this character assassination BS.<p>Brian Burgess is a political operative, not a journalist.<p>The State of Florida has all of her email correspondence at work and after firing her for insubordination the best evidence they can offer from a person they allege is such a terrible human being is that she sent an email that said &quot;that&#x27;s a wrong call&quot; and then complying with the request.<p>As far as I can tell Jones&#x27; work since her firing has been fine and that the Governor felt the need to use his platform smear her just bolsters her credibility, as does this absurd police action at her house. Looks like you did more research than the original article. Just a few mins of googling to try to dig up the facts. &gt; Apparently she has also has a criminal history including battery against a police officer and sexual cyberstalking of her ex-boyfriend.<p>Please do not post off-topic and irrelevant information onto existing threads, you run the risk of derailing the current conversation.<p>Her criminal history has nothing to do with whether or not this specific warrant, raid, and overall government response was justified. &quot;battery against a police officer&quot; obviously relates to the level of danger that a police officer would be expecting. If that happened before, it is more likely to happen again. Two problems:<p>A) That is an extremely dangerous road to encourage law enforcement to go down. &quot;Charged with&quot; is not the same as a conviction, and resisting arrest is a broad category that can encompass a wide variety of behaviors. Police in most instances should judge danger based on the current information they have, based on who is actively presenting a threat -- not based on whether or not someone was <i>charged</i> with something in the past. I can go into more detail on that if you want, but... I don&#x27;t really think it should be hard to figure out why that would be problematic.<p>B) Even ignoring the above point, your comment is exactly the kind of off-topic change I was warning about. This thread was started by someone claiming that Rebekah&#x27;s <i>whistleblowing</i> was justified and that it was worth throwing financial aid her way because she was doing the right thing. It was followed by another commenter questioning why she deserved aid, and as evidence that she didn&#x27;t, that commenter devolved into a personal attack over her previous criminal record. Now we&#x27;re debating whether the police used excessive force and whether they should have been scared of her.<p>The thread is off topic. The point is, the police shouldn&#x27;t have done a raid over a crime this minor in the first place. Rebekah&#x27;s previous criminal record doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the severity of the crime that caused this raid. The conversation over how police should have acted during the raid is a distraction from the original point that this was not the kind of crime that warranted breaking down someone&#x27;s door and pointing a gun at their family.<p>&quot;battery against a police officer&quot; in a completely separate case does not change that point. It&#x27;s irrelevant information to what we&#x27;re currently talking about. &gt;another commenter questioning why she deserved aid<p>No, that is incorrect. OP claimed she was a whistleblower, with no evidence. I outlined the facts that we have available, which seem to show she wasn&#x27;t.<p>&gt;that commenter devolved into a personal attack over her previous criminal record.<p>Giving details of someone&#x27;s previous publicly available criminal record isn&#x27;t a &quot;personal attack&quot;. What do those prior charges against her have to do with whether or not she&#x27;s a whistleblower in this specific case? Nothing.<p>&gt; Giving details of someone&#x27;s previous publicly available criminal record isn&#x27;t a &quot;personal attack&quot;.<p>It is when it&#x27;s irrelevant information tacked on just just to give an impression that her account of what happened here is untrustworthy. If you had left that sentence off and not mentioned her prior charges, would anything about the rest of your comment have needed to change? What were you trying to accomplish by bringing up unrelated prior charges other than to impugn her character?<p>&gt;  I outlined the facts that we have available, which seem to show she wasn&#x27;t.<p>Eh... let&#x27;s not go overboard here. You linked 2 relevant articles, one of which is largely sympathetic to Jones&#x27; account, and one of which is an opinion piece that devolves into the same personal attacks in your own comment.<p>Then to drive home the point of how important you thought her prior charges were, you linked a 3rd article that&#x27;s only talking about those charges and nothing else. The default is lawful until proven otherwise. And that goes for the police who executed the search warrant - lawful until proven otherwise. The warrant is issued by a judge meeting a probable cause standard. And pointing a gun at her children is just dandy, isn’t it? Cops training and behavior is one huge problem in the US. The other part of the problem is people like you, people who justify and normalize their violent behavior. If i were to choose what’s worse I’d say it is actually not the cops who are trained poorly, it’s people like you whose thinking is distorted towards violence They were clearing a corner (assuming the kids were off-frame since the video didn&#x27;t show it). I see no problem with what was presented in the article&#x2F;video. Training and behavior is a major problem, but I don&#x27;t see it in this case. If you had any training, then you would have understood there was no abuse in what was presented. I have some training. When I was taught to clear corners it was always done by the first person to go around the corner. There isn&#x27;t much point in clearing a corner when you have someone friendly who has already gone around it.<p>The LEO who is clearing the corner has also gone to a higher escalation of force than the other LEOs. Other LEOs have weapons drawn but he&#x27;s the only one pointing his gun at things. The fact that only one person is behaving differently, and more aggressively, suggests to me that their behavior isn&#x27;t appropriate here. The first person went past the stairs (you clear floor by floor). It would be better to park the first person at the stairs while the others proceed to search the rest of the first floor, basically a modified bounding overwatch. That way you don&#x27;t have to reclear the stairs everytime you pass it (since the upstairs has not been cleared). You have to clear a corner of your conscience and learn some empathy (fake it till you make it). If it ever happened to you and your family you’d be pissed and wouldn’t waste your energy in trying to justify their violent behavior Lol I have been the victim of police misconduct and filed a (successful) complaint against them. Maybe if you took some training and educated yourself on law and law enforcement, you would have some empathy for both sides instead of just one. There was no violence here. Soft violence or symbolic violence is what I was referring to here. It’s menant to humiliate, to subjugate, to impose unearned reapect and law enforcement abuse it all the friggin time. Just once in a while is there is a honest and really respectful cop that not cooperating with doesn’t even appear like an option. But when cops bark orders and you’re supposed to say yes sir, i’ll do whatever you please because you’re authority, that’s when we’re dealing with soft violence Well, unless you disband government all together there will always be soft violence - every government imposes its will over the people. If I pointed a gun at someone that would, at the very least, be assault with a deadly weapon. It&#x27;s definitely violence. But not if you’re law inforcement, it is considered routine or justified as a commenter did previously: they did clear some corner or whatever. This kind of behavior has sadly been normalized and is seen as acceptable now. If we don’t do something now we’ll have striking&#x2F;hitting&#x2F;punching suspects as normal too That&#x27;s not true at all and is a slippery slope argument. In fact, over the decades the courts have made numerous rulings in the opposite direction - giving suspects more rights and protections. That is not untrue, the courts have made some terrible rulings but that’s a different story. However, the law enforcement department has become increasingly trigger happy and there’s no denying of that. Brady v MD, Miranda, and others have strengthened people&#x27;s rights. Are there still problems? Yes. But overall it is getting better.<p>What evidence do you have that cops are more trigger happy now than before? The numbers seem pretty steady to me. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;251894&#x2F;number-of-justifiable-homicides-in-the-us&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;251894&#x2F;number-of-justifi...</a> They may indeed not be more trigger happy now than before but more evidence came to light now so the perception is that they are more trigger happy when in reality they WERE ALREADY trigger happy.<p>Im aware that there are professional law enforcement personnel but overall the institution failed to clean up its bad apples. Oh no, not only that but actively defends them. I didn&#x27;t say the warrant was not lawful.<p>But I have the right to give money to whoever I want until it is shown to be unlawful. You have the right to give money to anyone whether their actions were lawful or not. I was just wondering why people jump to give money to people they never met, based on 30 seconds of video and a short article. Maybe there&#x27;s more to it, like what was listed on the search warrant. Her actions seem to have been ethical and important regardless of whether they were lawful. I think the CEH exam would disagree with unauthorized access being ethical. What was her important action directly linked to this? Reporting accurate data on the current pandemic when government officials couldn&#x27;t be trusted to do so. On the balance of evidence I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that likely that she was responsible for the unauthorized access, and even if she did I don&#x27;t think the ethics would be as cut and dried as you&#x27;re making them out to be regardless of what CEH says. What if that message saved lives? What if, as a hypothetical&#x2F;counterfactual, it had saved thousands of lives? Ends justifying the means is generally not considered sound ethical thinking. She may feel it&#x27;s her moral responsibility, but it still wouldn&#x27;t be ethical. That&#x27;s an awfully flippant dismissal of an entire major branch of moral philosophy. Consequentialism has its critics and I don&#x27;t expect everyone to subscribe to it in a strict sense, but if your own moral philosophy doesn&#x27;t justify unauthorized access to a computer system to save lives (and s&#x2F;thousands&#x2F;billions&#x2F; if it&#x27;s just a matter of degree) we&#x27;ll just have to agree to disagree. They said ethics, not morals. &gt; Ends justifying the means is generally not considered sound ethical thinking.<p>Sure it is; what else <i>could</i> justify means?<p>It is often recognized that there is a tendency to make arguments about ends justifying means when the benefits realistically foreseeable from an action are not such that they should be seen as justifying the particular means, though. It would be better if you call it by its name then - utilitarianism. The choice with the greatest good or least harm. This is different from the ends justifying the means, which is colloquially used to justify bad actions. &gt; It would be better if you call it by its name then - utilitarianism.<p>Non-utilitarian deontological systems typically have rules about which means are appropriate to which ends, so, no, ends properly justifying means isn’t exclusive to utilitarian systems. &gt; Non-utilitarian deontological systems typically have rules about which means are appropriate to which ends, so, no, ends properly justifying means isn’t exclusive to utilitarian systems.<p>In the example you mention, the means are justified by the rules, not the ends. &gt; In the example you mention, the means are justified by the rules, not the ends.<p>No, in a deontological system where the appropriate means are tied to the ends, the means are justified by the ends. The rules are the decision principals, but the ends are (in that case) the inputs. &gt; deontological system where the appropriate means are tied to the ends, the means are justified by the ends.<p>according to the rules.<p>&gt; The rules are the decision principals, but the ends are (in that case) the inputs.<p>Whether an input provides justification is a function of whether the rules specify that it does or not. Sure, justification in any system is a product of the the rules as applied to the facts.<p>But, just as in reasoning from facts with rules of logic and inference to conclusions of facts, you don&#x27;t say knowledge of the fact conclusion is justified by the rules of logic and inference, but by the source facts, so when ethical rules consider means in determining ends, it is said that those ends are justified by the means. In either the fact or ethics case you will, when it is not otherwise clear from context, cite the particular rule framework within which you are working, but even then you wouldn&#x27;t say the conclusion or action is justified by the rule framework, though you might say it is justified <i>within</i> the rule framework by the applicable premises. You&#x27;re arguing about the individual definitions of specific words while ignoring the overall question. Nobody here cares about the subtle differences you see between  &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morals.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the question: if you have the opportunity to save hundreds or thousands of lives by breaking a minor law, are you justified in breaking that law? Many of us would say yes. The alternative is absurd, it doesn&#x27;t hold up in the real world. How many widely accepted historical heroes do we have who broke laws to save lives?<p>tfehring&#x27;s point still stands, and I think you should respond to their post using the meaning that they obviously intended before you get mired down in a more pedantic debate over the technical definition of individual words. I think you&#x27;re mistaken to think that more data will save people&#x27;s lives. The people not wearing masks have turned it into a political ideology, which doesnt respond well to data base arguments. In a just world, these cops would get a 10 year prison term for this.  They had no reason to aim their guns at these citizens, especially children. Maybe they assume Florida Man lives there. Media outlets...<p>&quot;Agents raid home of fired Florida data scientist who built COVID-19 dashboard&quot;<p>That implies it was raided because she was working on the dashboard, but it was raided because she allegedly accessed an emergency messaging system she should have no longer had access to.<p>That headline primes you to be outraged.<p>Could this have been revenge from the agency for what happened earlier this year? Maybe, but the article doesn&#x27;t actually suggest that, and there&#x27;s no evidence of it. Not addressing claims of her data accuracy she &lt;strike&gt;did break&lt;&#x2F;strike&gt; apparently broke CFAA:<p>&gt; &quot;FDLE began an investigation November 10, 2020, after receiving a complaint from the Department of Health (DOH) regarding unauthorized access to a Department of Health messaging system which is part of an emergency alert system, to be used for emergencies only,&quot; Plessinger said. &gt; <i>All authorized users use the same user name and password.</i><p>Having shared credentials for an account is going to make it very difficult to prove who accessed the system.<p>Also, the single user for a common system typically means that they didn&#x27;t want to pay extra to have multiple users. Makes me wonder if this incident will open Florida to a lawsuit by the vendor. &gt; Having shared credentials for an account is going to make it very difficult to prove who accessed the system.<p>As others have said, if she actually used the system, access from her home IP might be enough to convict.<p>&gt; Makes me wonder if this incident will open Florida to a lawsuit by the vendor.<p>Possibly, but that&#x27;d be civil law. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to be in that agency&#x27;s shoes right now. Somewhat on tangent but interesting fact I just read about the CFAA - two cofounders of HN (Morris and Swartz) were convicted of breaking CFAA - Morris being the first ever. Assuming Morris and Swartz here are Robert Morris and Aaron Swartz - Morris is a cofounder of YC, but I don&#x27;t believe he had much to do with HN. Swartz was involved with Reddit, not HN. Ah you might be right about Swartz. I thought Morris developed the HN we use today? He was a co-developer on the Lisp variant that HN is written in, but as far as I know the HN codebase was PG doing a POC that said Lisp variant could write software (and given he was more concerned with Lisp then and Reddit, then a company YC had investments in, had just rewritten from Lisp to Python, maybe making the case that Lisp could be used) I&#x27;d say administrative work is considered involvement no?

But if it turns out her allegations are correct, and the state was manipulating the data, I think that more than excuses it, and makes the police action malicious (criminal?) retaliation. If the state wasn&#x27;t manipulating any data, then it&#x27;s disorderly and improper (though doesn&#x27;t call for armed officers still...).<p>Like most things, you have to sort out the details of the case before you can pronounce judgement.<p>Call me biased, but for some reason, when people sacrifice their careers and freedoms to send out a warning about corruption, I usually give them a lot more trust than the institution under scrutiny. Time will tell. She may or may not have broken CFAA. I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence proving it was she who sent the unauthorized message. There was enough evidence to obtain a search warrant which was executed. It won&#x27;t be public until her case goes to court. Looks like you&#x27;re right. The warrant affidavit links her IP address to the unauthorized message.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.miamiherald.com&#x2F;latest-news&#x2F;article247682356.ece&#x2F;BINARY&#x2F;FDLE%20search%20warrant%20affidavit.pdf#storylink=readmore_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.miamiherald.com&#x2F;latest-news&#x2F;article247682356.ece...</a> &gt; she did break CFAA<p>Allegedly Background to this discussed earlier in the year fwiw:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23231237\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23231237</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23236613\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23236613</a> I wish that people with this mindset could be denied entry to Europe even for vacationing.<p>They are aware of the context, they know that they are entering a house where also a husband and two children are living. What makes them believe that they pose any kind of threat?<p>I&#x27;m not expecting them to ask for a coffee and discuss the matter and further proceedings at the table, but threatening everybody with a firearm like that? The chilling effect is the point. As I recall, she first became famous claiming that the dashboard was deceptive and hiding cases and deaths.<p>That turned out to not be true, at all.  It was just a very convenient story for journalists who, weirdly, have been obsessed with highlighting deaths in states run by Republicans, and simultaneously ignoring the same in blue states due to their narrative bias.<p>Illinois has been practically ignored because of this bias, despite very bad numbers in the latest spike, while when Georgia first relaxed it&#x27;s lockdowns in May, articles were published calling it &quot;an experiment in human sacrifice&quot;.  (Didn&#x27;t see a surge in cases afterwards, since most Georgians are sane and just kept wearing masks while going places)<p>While I always am against excessive police force, I also am fed up with journalists trying to dramatize things, and add credibility when it&#x27;s not needed to any cause celebre.  A person who builds dashboards isn&#x27;t a data scientist BTW.<p>Edit:<p>I&#x27;m fully aware I&#x27;ll be downvoted to oblivion for this post, but this person is a COVID alarmist, has pushed for excessive caution, and claims credentials and skills she doesn&#x27;t have.  I particularly resent her pushing for keeping elementary schools closed despite all of Europe and the vast majority of peer reviewed scientific literature saying otherwise.  She&#x27;s marketed herself as a renegade scientist all year, and dramatized all of it to great effect.<p>Second Edit:<p>Here she is in spring making the claim on Rachel Maddow that Florida was &quot;hiding&quot; hospitalization data.

The absence of a massive, national scandal resulting in the impeachment of DeSantis proves that Florida wasn&#x27;t hiding anything, months later.  Her claims were always made without evidence, and were magnified by partisan actors. &gt; The absence of a massive, national scandal resulting in the impeachment of DeSantis proves that Florida wasn&#x27;t hiding anything<p>I&#x27;m sorry but that proves nothing of the sort. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Sure but when you make an absolute claim that something <i>is</i> true, absence of evidence is enough for any reasonable person to disbelieve the claim entirely. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an accurate recounting of the dispute. She wanted some data included; the government didn&#x27;t because it thought it was invalid&#x2F;made them look bad; and she disobeyed orders around how and which data to publish, which is what got her fired. I don&#x27;t think any of that is even in dispute.<p>The big question is whether you trust Ron DeSantis more to make scientific judgments, or a random low level professional. It&#x27;s a few days later, but here&#x27;s a pretty extensive report on the Florida coverup from the Florida Sun Sentinel, titled &quot;Secrecy and spin: How Florida’s governor misled the public on the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-coronavirus-florida-desantis-spin-ss-prem-20201203-tyjmgkos6bd7vo7vnripqliany-htmlstory.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sun-sentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;fl-ne-coronavirus-f...</a><p>It doesn&#x27;t directly state that hospitalizations numbers were actual lies, but it does demonstrate how the information was spun and presented in a very misleading way. The absence of a national scandal proves nothing. Proof has to meet a much higher bar than that. Does it lend some support for thinking there was nothing there perhaps. But it is far from proof. She made an assertion that Florida was hiding covid hospitalizations.  Where was the bar of proof then?  That which can be asserted with no evidence can be refuted with none as well.<p>So tons of people in Florida died, and they hid it?  Because that&#x27;s the only way this wouldn&#x27;t have been a scandal if the private hospitals and public health authorities had colluded to &quot;hide&quot; hospitalizations and deaths. I would be interested in sources. For your brave actions in the face of danger I award you an upvote ;) “ All authorized users use the same user name and password.” It’s Weev all over again. &gt; &quot;complaint from the Department of Health (DOH) regarding unauthorized access to a Department of Health messaging system which is part of an emergency alert system, to be used for emergencies only&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents. After several attempts and verbal notifications that law enforcement officers were there to serve a legal search warrant, Ms. Jones eventually came to the door and allowed agents to enter,&quot; I sure hope she can get some good legal help.

Just gross. Plenty of people in America think that having your kids put in refrigerated cages is a perfectly normal and justifiable consequence of your commission of a misdemeanor.<p>Just threatening them temporarily with violent death is nothing compared with that. &gt; pointed guns at her kids.<p>That is a problem. It might be poor training. It might be bad policy. It might be personnel who make bad decisions. Or some mix of all three.<p>But it isn&#x27;t corruption. Sure it is.  These &quot;personnel who make bad decisions&quot; are accepting money as recompense for their role as mafia enforcers.  Just-following-orders is a corrupt moral position which has resulted in the deaths of a lot of innocent people.<p>I understand that when you think of corruption you are assuming several magnitudes greater recompense but you have to remember how the little folks live. I didn&#x27;t see that in the video that was posted, where is the evidence for this claim? My laptop was not able to keep up with all the adtech running on this website. Has anybody verified the original story where she says that she refused to manipulate data? Is that true? I&#x27;m not from the US and I don&#x27;t know if &quot;floridatoday.com&quot; is a trusted source. This must be one of the weirdest arrests I&#x27;ve seen. I would understand officers busting in guns drawn if they considered denizens dangerous. I would understand an arrest without guns drawn. But casually walking in with a gun (in case there&#x27;s something to kill) makes this look like a psycho checking in.<p>From my non-US perspective all these gun first arrests look crazy, especially for handling car speeding or non-violent offenders.

Ahh, the land of the free! &quot;All authorized users use the same user name and password.&quot;<p>Oh, well done. She says she has backups of the website data and files, but I wonder if she has backups of the evidence of state corruption that she said was also on her computer? Land of the free? The US a has created its own reality and complicity enables it to persist. It made its bed, now lie in it or do something and stop whining. Actually, now I wonder how big the difference between the official and her numbers is. I looks like someone really want to silence her. They drew guns on her and her kids.<p>I&#x27;d say we should be outraged, but we&#x27;re awash in outrage because the rule of law has become a one sided bludgeoning instrument for the government to suppress dissent.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to get out of here. To hell with this place any more. #sad Defund the police. &gt; \nJones has had a history of run-ins with law enforcement in Florida. It involves multiple cases, all but a single case closed without a conviction. One is a robbery charge that was dropped when no evidence was produced for prosecution. The rest, including the active one, relate to Jones&#x27; personal life. She is currently facing one misdemeanor count of cyberstalking, stemming from what appears to be an acrimonious breakup.<p>BPD case illegally accessing a state database to publish misleading covid agitprop? I&#x27;m shocked. or they could have changed the password, but that being &#x27;murica, I guess dudes with ghuunz is a reasonable alternative I&#x27;m sorry but this is absurd.<p>No the police did not &quot;raid&quot; her house.  The showed up at her house and knocked on the door for 20 minutes until she eventually answered the door, and was arrested.<p>They <i>did</i> go into her house with guns drawn, presumably because the other people inside were refusing to come out.<p>To people who are shocked that they would do this: there are like a billion guns in The United States.  The cops are doing this because the threat of somebody shooting them is real.  To avoid this: when the police show up at your house, with a warrant, come outside unarmed.  Part of the respect of due process is reciprocal.  They have a warrant, which was granted to them by a judge.  They aren&#x27;t <i>requesting</i> to come into your house, they are <i>ordering</i> you to leave, as a part of a functioning judicial system.<p>On this person&#x27;s twitter account, she calls these people the &quot;gestapo&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but no these are not the gestapo.  The gestapo were a secret police used by the Nazis.  They showed up at people&#x27;s houses and <i>killed them</i> or <i>sent them to death camps</i>.  They didn&#x27;t use a warrant, politely knock on your door and try to call your phone for 20 minutes, and eventually take you to a jail cell where you would be granted a trial.<p>I&#x27;m so fed up with the holocaust denial that these people engage in when they make these outrageous comparisons.  The Nazis were <i>NOTHING</i> like contemporary America.  NOTHING.  They were loading human beings into train cars, sending them to industrial killing facilities, and killing them.  Sometimes they would perform vivisections on them, they would be raped, and tortured, and starved to death if they waited long enough to be killed by the gas chambers.<p>That is so, so, so far from anything that is happening in The US, and every time somebody tries to make one of these comparisons it only causes people to forget who the Nazis were, what they did, and <i>how horrific</i> it was.<p>This woman&#x27;s home wasn&#x27;t raided, she was served a search warrant.  These people weren&#x27;t the gestapo, they were a civilian police force.<p>Stop this. Such a crazy time, who do you believe? Was it the govt afraid of covid data or was she guilty of revenge harassment against her boyfriend? What if this is false? Like, everybody here is quick to believe that someone raided a home and pointed guns at the faces of children. What if it is a lie? How do we know it&#x27;s not beyond &quot;oh yes it&#x27;s the US so it makes sense&quot; What if I had four legs and a tail? Edit for clarity: both are non sequiturs. You provide no justification for your spurious speculation. The article has a video. There&#x27;s a video corroborating exactly what she says happened in the article that is linked.<p>You can click the link and see for yourself. I just watched the video, and I didn&#x27;t see anyone have a gun pointed at them. I saw a cop holding a gun and another cop point his gun at the top of a staircase that&#x27;s out of frame. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ocalapost.com&#x2F;rebekah-jones-created-revenge-site-posted-nudes-of-a-man-desantis-speaks-out&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ocalapost.com&#x2F;rebekah-jones-created-revenge-site...</a> This doesn&#x27;t seem to justify a guns-out raid of her home half a year later. How can the police aim a gun at someone that clearly do not pose a threat? In most cases, one reason they can is because there is no enforced repercussion for doing so.<p>Most police forces do in fact have rules for this type of conduct and institutional mechanisms to regulate it, but enforcement has become discretionary to the point of non existence.<p>Please note that this description is extremely generalized and that there are numerous other factors. I’m not making a comment about whether it was right for them to do so or not, but “someone that clearly do not pose a threat” is not as clear cut a category as it might seem. When the potential consequences of making an incorrect judgment are very large, they have to be extremely careful in drawing such conclusions. Another major issue we have with policing in the US (aside from the people who are only there as a power trip) is that one group with little variation in training is sent in for everything from jaywalking to armed robbery.<p>The odds of any random police officer encountering a situation where they are going to be truly in harms way are lower than the odds they use excessive force against a cooperative person. It&#x27;s horrific.<p>Being a pizza delivery driver is twice as dangerous as being a police officer. Because they are scum. Many police in America are scum, a state of affairs perpetuated by a profound lack of accountability to the public. They can break down the wrong door in the night, murder the innocent occupants, and face no meaningful penalties (let alone meaningful <i>criminal</i> penalties) despite obvious negligence leading up to and during the incident. Given that, one can see how the wrong kind of people (assuming the job is what we naively assume it&#x27;s supposed to be about) are often drawn to police jobs.<p>edit: This is a strongly worded comment. I believe strong words are appropriate when we’re talking about atrocities like the murder of innocents under the color of law. These scum are not a “side” that deserves “equal consideration”—we have a responsibility to figure out what’s true and what isn’t to the best of our abilities, but ultimately we need to strongly condemn evil whenever and wherever it manifests, and the breed of authoritarian cruelty practiced by many American police definitely qualifies.<p>Also note that I have intentionally not said <i>all</i> police are scum, because that’s obviously not true. I didn&#x27;t see any gun-aiming at her, or even drawn guns before she was escorted outside in the posted video.  The only place I&#x27;ve seen that claim is from the subject of the raid. Then you weren&#x27;t watching the video.  They drew guns after entering the residence.  They pointed them up the stairs where she said her husband and two children were.  Thus they were pointing guns at her children. Watch the full video on her twitter account, it happens about 10-20 seconds into the video. Whether the claims are true or not, the video does not support it.<p>&gt; They drew guns after entering the residence.<p>Yes, but she claims:<p>&gt;&gt; They pointed a gun in my face.<p>In the video, she clearly leaves the residence before any guns are drawn. Potentially the cop to the left of the door from the camera&#x27;s perspective has his hand on his gun, but it&#x27;s not drawn either. So if this happened, it&#x27;s not on video.<p>&gt; They pointed them up the stairs where she said her husband and two children were. Thus they were pointing guns at her children.<p>She doesn&#x27;t say that and the video doesn&#x27;t support it.<p>She says:<p>&gt;&gt; I tell them my husband and my two children are upstairs... and THEN one of them draws his gun.<p>&gt;&gt; On my children.<p>According to the video, she&#x27;s outside at this point. It&#x27;s not clear how she can know where they are, except that she might have assumed they were where she last saw them. She actually says they &#x27;are upstairs&#x27; which doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;at the top of the stairs&#x27;, but &#x27;on the second floor.&#x27;<p>If anything, the video disputes the idea that they are at the top of the stairs. There is a light source shining down on the steps, but there are no shadows.<p>In fact, I don&#x27;t even read that she&#x27;s making the claim that the cops pointed guns at her children, merely that they <i>drew</i> the guns on her children. The video does support this claim since it could be argued that they were drawing their guns on anyone who might be in the house, whether they were physically in the same space or not. Yup. You can even hear her complaining about the cops pointing guns at her children while she&#x27;s outside the house and can&#x27;t possibly know what the police are pointing guns at. I&#x27;d bet she was planning this smear campaign from the moment police showed up at her house.<p>Having guns drawn while making sure there&#x27;s no threat in the house is perfectly normal. I&#x27;d do the exact same if I was executing a search warrant. It is a shame that Florida exists as a state. You made The Gov look bad? Then yeah, you gonna get The Treatment. What did you expect? I don&#x27;t know... rule of law? Something <i>better</i> than a shithole country? Note that none of them were armed, she was cooperating, and the police came in with their guns drawn and pointed them at children.<p>This is why police should be unarmed. They can&#x27;t be trusted if they have guns on hand.<p>I hope she sues those officers. Note that the video doesn&#x27;t show the police pointing guns at any one, child or adult. I&#x27;m going to trust the women screaming about them pointing their guns at her children.<p>But even if they just had them out, that&#x27;s improper police work. You gun should only be drawn if the intent is to kill someone. They went in there with the intent of terrorising their victim. At no point did anyone demonstrate <i>any</i> threat to the officers, and so at no point should they have had their guns out.<p>That&#x27;s basic gun safety 101. &gt; I&#x27;m going to trust the women screaming about them pointing their guns at her children.<p>Sure, you can do what you want but usually in law enforcement we like to see evidence presented for serious accusations. In fact that is how they obtained the search warrant for the screaming woman&#x27;s residence, by showing evidence to a judge.<p>&gt; But even if they just had them out, that&#x27;s improper police work.<p>What are your qualifications for criticizing warrant service procedure?<p>&gt; You gun should only be drawn if the intent is to kill someone.<p>Thats wrong in multiple ways, you don&#x27;t seem to have the relevant background knowledge and experience to discuss this issue.<p>Ask yourself how upset you would be with a police officer&#x27;s use of deadly force if you learned that he had <i>intended to kill</i> the person he shot, rather than intending to save someone&#x27;s life?<p>&gt; They went in there with the intent of terrorising their victim.<p>You don&#x27;t know that. You could just as easily believe that the woman refused to open the door for 20 minutes in order to antagonize law officers in the performance of their official duties. This is why we want people to support their statements with evidence instead of pretending to read minds.<p>&gt; At no point did anyone demonstrate any threat to the officers, and so at no point should they have had their guns out.<p>Perhaps that would have been the case if they had responded to the officers in a timely manner. After a 20 minute wait, its possible that the individuals in the house have set up to attack the police when they enter.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s basic gun safety 101.<p>Hard to take lectures on gun safety from someone who hasn&#x27;t demonstrated the relevant qualifications. Somebody fired from a job over a grievance <i>allegedly</i> used unauthorized access and is surprised the FBI showed up at her door? I don&#x27;t understand.<p>And in case anyone thinks I&#x27;m trolling, I&#x27;m not. Dead serious.<p>Edit: I said FBI, I was wrong about that- but still- if she&#x27;s accusing of unauthorized access, isn&#x27;t such a raid par for the course? added <i>allegedly</i> above. Even if you believe retributive justice is to be doled out by LE, one of its own principles is: &quot;It is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers.&quot;<p>And I&#x27;m not buying that guns-drawn arrest with kids present is necessary. Dead serious. I didn&#x27;t comment at all about that kids having a gun pointed at them. <i>that</i> is awful. The rest? Sounds like normal legal proceedings against somebody suspected of committing a computer crime. When you&#x27;re making policies for people who both fire guns and have guns fired upon them for a living, you don&#x27;t get to be very fine-grained in those policies. The situations are, by their nature, chaotic.<p>In a situation where police are <i>legitimately</i> going in with guns drawn (like, I dunno, arresting actual terrorists known to have actual guns?), they don&#x27;t have the luxury of determining whether someone&#x27;s a child before pointing a gun in their face. If anyone in the house could be armed and firing back, they need to point the gun first.<p>So, there isn&#x27;t a realistic &quot;They shouldn&#x27;t have pointed guns at children, but the rest of it is fine.&quot; Either it&#x27;s okay to point guns at children because the situation demanded it, and the moral culpability of the child&#x27;s trauma (or worse) is on whoever left children with armed outlaws... or they shouldn&#x27;t have gone in with guns at all to the personal residence of someone whose alleged crime involved no violent action of any sort. Actually, no. Retributive justice is not something LE <i>usually</i> gets involved in (within civilized democracies). It is left for the courts. The way she was arrested isn&#x27;t normal, nor necessary. But I suspect that was the point. She hasn&#x27;t been charged with any crime. It&#x27;s way too early to be accusing a whistleblower of being a criminal.<p>You&#x27;ve seen zero evidence of her being responsible and you still accuse her? As far as I can tell from the story, there is no evidence whatsoever that she had anything to do with the unauthorized access, which seems to consist of somebody logging into an account that has a shared username and password (!) and posting a message that got emailed out to ~1700 people. &gt; As far as I can tell from the story, there is no evidence whatsoever that she had anything to do with the unauthorized access<p>They had to get a warrant to search her home. Seems unlikely that a judge would issue a warrant without some kind of probable cause. While the system was poorly secured, a lot of poorly secured systems have basic logging. All it would take is an IP address.<p>None of us are privy to the details here, so it&#x27;s really hard to say. &gt; Seems unlikely that a judge would issue a warrant without some kind of probable cause.<p>Unfortunately, here in the US that is not something you can bank on. There is a large amount of evidence that judges routinely sign on warrants without even understanding what the warrant is for, and there are even many types of non-standard warrants that do not need to follow that protocol. You&#x27;re just assuming that&#x27;s what the warrant was related to.<p>She hasn&#x27;t been charged, let alone found guilty, of any crime. I made it clear that it was conjecture on my part. Pulling the IP from server logs was the most likely reason they got the warrant. Turns out that was indeed the case. &gt; Somebody fired from a job over a grievance used unauthorized access and is surprised the FBI showed up at her door? I don&#x27;t understand.<p>This was state police rather than federal (a highly relevant distinction, given the context) and the snide &quot;surprised&quot; is unwarranted&#x2F;baseless when we don&#x27;t have even the full facts from one side let alone both sides. We don&#x27;t actually know that she used unauthorized access. (Innocent until proven guilty? Apparently not here!)<p>That aside, even if she <i>did</i>, is that reason to storm in with guns? The level of possible harm is incredibly out of proportion with the supposed crime. It wasn&#x27;t the FBI, it was the FDLE. Also, the warrant was for something (more or less) completely unrelated. I&#x27;m not sure she is surprised. But if her grievance is that her employer is not fulfilling its public health mission, and the data she is sharing is public health data she feels the public has a right to see, then she might feel getting arrested is unjust. While the arrest may or may not be unjust, the fact of the matter is that she broke the law. Which typically results in police showing up. Regardless of your attitude about what she did, the title can be really boiled down to &#x27;data scientist releases confidential federal data; gets arrested&#x27;. How is it &quot;the fact of the matter that she broke the law?&quot;<p>She hasn&#x27;t even been accused of breaking the law. There have been zero charges. Can you explain to me why COVID-19 data should be considered confidential? My first thought is that she got raided because she was releasing data that contradicted the Official Florida State COVID-19 data. The alleged crime is unauthorized access to a government communication system and has nothing to do with covid-19 data.<p>The evidence provided in the article for the crime is flimsy at best however. The communication system had a shared username and password for everyone and the warrant was reported to be based on an IP address that was believed to be the source of the unauthorized access.<p>It seems reasonable to go 50&#x2F;50 on either of:<p>1. they looked for and found a reason to charge her with this as retribution for her work.<p>2. she was disgruntled enough about being let go that she illegally accessed a poorly secured government system to send a retaliatory communication.<p>There is no where near enough information to know which is which though. They weren’t FBI, they were state police. And this was more than showing up at her door: they came in with guns drawn, pointed them at people. One cop had his finger on the trigger. &gt; Somebody fired from a job over a grievance used unauthorized access and is surprised the FBI showed up at her door?<p>From the article, I think it was the Florida state police, not the FBI. Lets see if she actually used unauthorized access or they just picked someone who could have done it and was convenient to blame. They aren&#x27;t FBI. Where is the evidence she did it? Even if she did send the text, why do they need that many guns drawn (check out the rifle on the last guy in the vid)? Yeah sounds particularly risky to break the CFAA. Or indeed simply to be accused of doing so; sounds like a _lot_ of people had access to the shared credentials. yeah baby lick that boot! Please don’t do that here. We really wish no one would do that, but they just keep lickin&#x27;! Frustrating really...",

This reminds me of a similar, and quite popular, 90&#x27;s rock song in Australia called &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot; [0]. It refers to the horrible exploitive activities of CSL on an asbestos mine in the Pilbara region of Australia where they controlled their workers in a similar manner to what you describe here.<p>0. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blue_Sky_Mine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blue_Sky_Mine</a> And nothing’s as precious as a hole in the ground. That is <i>de facto</i> slavery! Well, it&#x27;s actually <i>de facto</i> indentured servitude. I would call it Capitalism without opposition from the Left. This is objectively the case. It’s exactly what happens every time the left is broadly defeated. And I literally mean every single time. It&#x27;s Soviet Union in miniature. Whether someone owns the land by property right or &quot;owns&quot; &quot;common grounds&quot; by administrative right, the result seems to be the same: Oppression of those, who don&#x27;t.<p>And this is why a strong opposition is important. It makes oppression much more difficult. (Probably) The first aerial bombardment on US soil was when private planes dropped homemade bombs on striking coal workers at Blair Mountain in 1921.

The Birger Gang, led by Russian immigrant Charlie Birger, and the Shelton Gang, led by brothers Carl, Earl and Bernie, had been involved in a bloody turf battle for domination of the southern Illinois liquor racket for several months. Their ever-escalating arms race had evolved from shotguns to tommy guns and even homemade trucks covered with armored plate used to shoot up each other&#x27;s roadhouses.</i><p>&gt; <i>The warfare turned particularly violent in November 1926 as a series of shootings, bombings, and destruction of property caused terror throughout the county. Upping the ante once again, the Sheltons embarked on a bold plan to destroy the Birger Gang hideout, a place known as Shady Rest. They approached a pilot on a barnstorming tour and coerced him into taking a member of the gang on an overflight of the Birger roadhouse. On 12 November 1926, gang member Blackie Armes climbed aboard the old Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; biplane carrying several bombs, each made out of dynamite sticks bound around a bottle of nitroglycerine. While passing over Shady Rest, Armes lighted and dropped three of the devices. Only one exploded, missing its intended target and instead killing Birger&#x27;s favorite bulldog and pet bird. Though initially stunned, members of the Birger gang fired back but did no damage. The shocked pilot flew back to the airfield, let the gangster off, and then immediately took off again, probably fearing for his life!</i> It&#x27;s definitely either Blair Mountain or the Tulsa Race Massacre; there are some disputes about there actually being planes bombing in Tulsa but there was definitely a bomb dropped at Blair because one dud showed up in court. Both were in 1921 though which beats your thing by several years, didn&#x27;t know about it though it&#x27;s a wild story. Hey a fellow Little Egyptian.

In 1894, President Grover Cleveland pushed Congress to establish the holiday as a way to de-escalate class tension following the Pullman Strike, during which as many as ninety workers were gunned down by thousands of US Marshals serving at the pleasure of railway tycoon George Pullman, one of the time’s most hated industrial barons.<p>&gt;Cleveland was wary of the response to his actions.

Your employer can mistreat you under the threat of losing your employer-provided health insurance. If everyone had government-provided health insurance, then employers would have less leverage. Government-provided health insurance can also ease the burden and risk for people starting new companies.<p>It also maximizes the number of people paying into the insurance pool. &gt; If getting your health insurance through your employer creates dependency and gives your employer more control over you (and it does) then why is it a good idea to give this power to the government?<p>Does your government have due process?  If it does, how would that government use an obligation to provide you health insurance against you to influence your decisions?<p>People quit jobs far more often than they quit countries, and employer provided insurance does tie you to more strongly to your employer (e.g. I knew someone who needed a heart transplant who would literally die if he went without insurance, because he depended on a heart pump).<p>Also, you have to get insurance&#x2F;healthcare from somewhere, and in a democracy the government is <i>far</i> more accountable to its citizens than an employer typically is to its employees [1].<p>[1] This is very clear in the typical case, but less clear for people with rare in-demand skills (like software engineers). So you can switch employer and keep the care. The US military paid occupation soldiers in Berlin in scrip too. We also had the ludlow massacre where the local militia and mine company guards attacked the miners with machine guns (pre nfa...) and dynamite <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ludlow_Massacre\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ludlow_Massacre</a>. For anyone interested, there&#x27;s a 2014 documentary [1] about the Massacre and Louis Tikas [2], the main labor union organizer of the coal miners.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=22U0Hwb-7ao\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=22U0Hwb-7ao</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Louis_Tikas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Louis_Tikas</a> It&#x27;s important to remember that the strikers started the violence:<p>&gt;&gt;When leasing the sites, the union had selected locations near the mouths of canyons that led to the coal camps in order to block any strikebreakers&#x27; traffic.<p>Blocking strikebreaker traffic amounts to using violence to obstruct others&#x27; freedom of movement.<p>Strikebreakers were often assaulted and sometimes murdered.<p>The fundamentally coercive nature of historical striking activity is heavily glossed over, and modern day anti-free-market ideologues go to extreme lengths to try to justify it. Pinkerton (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pinkerton_(detective_agency)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pinkerton_(detective_agency)</a>) was one of those security companies. For some reason, the history page on the Pinkerton website has a big hole in it between 1907 and 1962. What could they have been up to in the early 20th Century, I wonder?\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinkerton.com&#x2F;our-story&#x2F;history\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinkerton.com&#x2F;our-story&#x2F;history</a> Is there anything stopping workers from crowdsource their own protection anonymously? Does it have to be some kind of formal union?<p>If you think about it, work is just a business deal and wouldn&#x27;t be possible for employees create some kind of company that deals with the companies they are employed? Pretty much like an agency, I guess. Oh, do you honestly think such an &quot;secretive, radical union cell&quot; funded by &quot;dark money&quot; would be allowed to exist and interface with corporates? (words in scare-quotes would be how this would be framed by employers and the media - they may or may not throw in foreign funding, Venezuela or China could get name-dropped with zero evidence). It doesn’t have to be secret, just your membership is secret.<p>It can have open plan offices in a cool neighborhood, pay politicians and all.<p>Just have centralized Emlpoyers information management system where information about employers, like salaries they pay business they do, the good and the bad to work there etc.<p>So when you are getting a job you apply to your not-union and they tell you what to expect and how much to ask. No more guesswork.<p>It’s like an HR that works for you. So it’s BR, businesses resources. Then the companies begin to fire employees that they find are part of this system and hire organizations like the Pinkertons to infiltrate and destroy your business resource system. They can fight back, of course but trying to destroy another company’s systems sounds super illegal.<p>Fine, throw a bug bounty program. So it&#x27;s like Glassdoor or Salary.com? That&#x27;s not a union, that&#x27;s not HR, that&#x27;s not armed protection. Are unions armed protection?<p>Anyway, the idea is to have a coordinator that work on your benefit. Companies, even the large ones are simply people coordinated by the capital owners.<p>The not-union is a coordinator  for the people who are not the capital owners but those who deal with the capital owners.<p>The aim is to assist for a fair deal through information, not to extort the capital owners. So...... a union? &gt; The aim is to assist for a fair deal through information, not to extort the capital owners.<p>This sounds similar to &quot;the aim is to be good, not bad&quot;.<p>Your assertion does not lie on facts but on your personal moral interpretation and even prejudice against a label.<p>Unions are organizations whose aim is to represent workers and defend their best interests with the company&#x27;s representatives.<p>Sometimes the company&#x27;s goals are in direct opposition to the workers&#x27;s best interests. How do you expect the negotiations to go if the company plans to strong-arm and coherce their workers into submissions. Well, this is not a union therefore doesn&#x27;t match all the features and objectives. The not-union aims to relieve inherit disadvantages of individuals v.s. corporations while preserving individual freedoms and free market dynamics. Just like companies coming together to fix a price and specs of their products thus leaving consumers with no options, workers coming together to force their own preferences by leaving companies with no options is also unacceptable.<p>If the unions actually do the things that you describe and people are happy with it, they should opt out for unions. &quot;<i>Are unions armed protection?</i>&quot;<p>Historically, yes, sometimes. Sounds like a talent agent. Sectors that utilize talent agents often still have strong collective bargaining agreements and unions in place. Part of the power of a union is the ability to deprive a business or industry of labor. A talent agent alone does not provide such leverage. I think you just described a union See, it&#x27;s not a union. Unions are apparently uncool in the USA. Think of it as Musk inventing the Tube by removing the engineeringly silly parts of the Hyperloop and adding a sharing economy feature to the result :)<p>Why would you share your &quot;not-union&quot; membership with your employer? Instead, use it as a coordinator between your peers to prevent being underpaid and overworked do to information disparity you normally have in your relationship with you employer and if you get screwed it turns out you have access to lawyers.<p>Something of that sort. The issue is that being in a &quot;not-union&quot; isn&#x27;t a protected class, so you could probably get fired for it after your employer sent the &quot;not-Pinkertons&quot; to do some intel.<p>To prevent this, you&#x27;d have to get your &quot;not-Union&quot; to either have huge solidarity, or lobby the government to make that a protected class.<p>Maybe if you went for the first you could make a song about it, how about &quot;Solidarity not-for-finite-periods-of-time&quot;? Why would they fire or investigate you? It’s not like you’re organizing strikes or anything like that. You are simply benefiting of the same knowledge that companies have to have a fairer deal. How are you going to negotiate without striking (or threatening a strike)? Why would the company care that you know you&#x27;re being underpaid if you&#x27;re still going to do your job either way? If you’re underpaid it means you can get a better deal somewhere else.<p>You’re going to negotiate with the knowledge in par with the company that is interested in having you.<p>Knowledge is power.\n- France is bacon. &gt; If you’re underpaid it means you can get a better deal somewhere else.<p>Unless companies conspire not to hire you in order to depress wages.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;biz&#x2F;news&#x2F;disney-settlement-wage-fixing-anti-poaching-animation-1201975084&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;biz&#x2F;news&#x2F;disney-settlement-wage-fix...</a> Individuals make their ways up and down the stack all the time.

Companies like to use their information and coordination advantage, and exploit it to their benefit.<p>It&#x27;s why some companies will try to find ways to fire you if you share your salary. I guess they’re free to try fight it. It doesn’t mean it’s helpless case. Measures and countermeasures, businesses as usual. Except one party is a billion dollar business, and the other party is a single worker relying on an hourly wage job.<p>Without the threat of collective action, the idea is toothless. Thanks to the not-union, the other party is not simply a single worker relying on an hourly wage job. Instead , the worker knows what can reasonably get from the company and if the company wrongs the worker, the not-union has the resources to help thanks to the subscription fees collected from the large number of members(potentially billions just like the companies). If you&#x27;re simply going to accept the company&#x27;s employment offer, why do you need the external organization? You aren’t simply going to accept any offer, you are going to negotiate a fair one thanks to the intelligence you obtain from not-union. Without leverage that comes from collective bargaining, how does the intelligence change your negotiating position? It’s not about extortion, it’s about fair deal. The knowledge is useful as market research, in a similar way knowing rent prices in the neighborhood when renting.<p>In the current situation, companies have access to this and employees don’t. Characterizing collective bargaining as extortion is part of the problem. So it&#x27;s like a union... but without any democratic control by the members, just a company trying to maximize profit from it&#x27;s &quot;customers&quot; instead?<p>What problem with unions are you trying to solve here? It’s with democratic control and not for profit, unless of course you vote for it to try to maximize profit.<p>It’s owned by a trust or something similar. A secret union. Would be labelled terrorists in no time flat. &gt;work is just a business deal and wouldn&#x27;t be possible for employees create some kind of company that deals with the companies they are employed?<p>have you read Godfather? Please explain? He&#x27;s referring to organized crime&#x2F;racketeering.  Your &#x27;not-union&#x27; scheme seems like organized crime if you squint a bit and imagine that it would be backed up with violence.<p>Populist tough-guy shakes down businesses to get back at The Man or some such.<p>Plus unions in the US have often been infiltrated by organized crime. This is a not-union, it doesn’t have those elements at all. It has a fancy office, a responsive website that nags you to use the app instead, and blogs about how they implemented the latest FUD and does have open source projects.<p>It has a Twitter savvy CEO a it’s mission is to make the world a better place. Pimps basically play the same role as unions. Congratulations, you&#x27;ve invented the Molly Maguires. This culminated in the Battle of Blair Mountain were mine owners employed private security and the US military to put down 10,000+ striking miners.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Blair_Mountain\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Blair_Mountain</a><p>It&#x27;s an incredible story of capitalism gone mad.

This is 100 year later, and despite of how many union die hards see it... most workers aren&#x27;t likely to buy int a centuries long struggle. They&#x27;re interested in their own lives &amp; jobs. I think the main points are:<p>1. Their own struggles aren&#x27;t new: companies have been trying to fuck workers over since time immemorial, and\n2. There is a well-known solution to these problems: unions.<p>Are you working 16 hours a day, barely able to afford rent + food + utilities, and slipping further into debt every day? <i>It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way</i>, and we have a really good idea, based on historical facts, about how to fix it. you do know that Appalachia is still the poorest area in the US, and the unions did not fix the economic problems.<p>yes it provided the employees that were still employed with greater protections, but it is not the utopia you seem to believe it is Nobody claimed a utopia. Extracting natural resources is always going to be a tough job that is ripe for exploitation.<p>Did unions improve the lives of members? They certainly did where I come from. American labour history is more complex (union corruption and take over by organised crime seemed to run deeper) That depends,  sure you can point to examples where the Union did improve peoples lives<p>But then i can also point to examples where they did not, where they ended up driving business out, bankrupting people<p>Where unions are more focused on their own political power than helping workers<p>Or even if in general the union helped the &quot;average worker&quot; the collectivist nature of unions means not everyone will be better off.  For example Seniority, and &quot;personal connections&quot; are often more of a driving factor in Unions than merit or work performance. In fact highly efficient hard workers are often driven out of unions or forced to &quot;work slower&quot;, etc. &gt;That depends, sure you can point to examples where the Union did improve peoples lives\nBut then i can also point to examples where they did not, where they ended up driving business out, bankrupting people<p>The answer to this is not airy theorizing or anecdotes but statistical evidence. There are many people who do this. See for example figure 9 here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;charting-wage-stagnation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;charting-wage-stagnation&#x2F;</a> Do you get vacations? Have a (nominally) 40-hour work week? lol,  that is not a valid response to criticize of unions.  Sorry but no And &quot;Appalachia is still a poor region&quot; is not a valid criticism of unions. Right, I think the point is that while things have improved since then, workers are still exploited. The only way to change that is for people to band together. Large, diverse, unified groups can bring about change.<p>The coal miners were mostly Irish and German immigrants and African Americans. They all joined together and brought about changes that workers still benefit from today. People in 2020 can do the same. I get that 100 years sounds like a long time, but the coal miners unionization stories are my grandfather&#x27;s. Things change fast and it is good to keep the past in mind when evaluating the decisions we make today. Neonazis were used to intimidate immigrant workers at Amazon facilities in Germany a few years ago, so it&#x27;s not exactly &quot;history&quot; for &quot;old comrades.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;amazon-used-neo-nazi-guards-keep-immigrant-workforce-under-control-germany-8495843.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;amazon-used-...</a>&quot; I&#x27;m all for the Amazon hate train but this is pretty weak. The journalist first says Pinkerton was hired in Poland to investigate irregularities in their application process. Amazon says they only hire Pinkerton to &quot;secure shipments&quot;. The &quot;acquired document&quot; says that Amazon tracks social media information about labor organization and strokes. It&#x27;s all over the place, and even assuming all parties report the truth, no one actually says that Pinkerton is doing surveillance related to unions.<p>Maybe NPR is missing something from the original article, which I couldn&#x27;t find linked, but come on. From the article:<p>&gt; We need to note that Amazon is an NPR funder.<p>The original Motherboard article [0] is extensive. The NPR version is deliberately incoherent.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports...</a> You actually believe that Amazon has editorial control over NPR and specifically exerted that leverage to make this article incoherent? One of the common threads in media critiques like <i>Manufacturing Consent</i> and <i>Hate, Inc.</i> is that direct editorial control is not necessary in order to promote your agenda. Control of money and access, along with ideological indoctrination of journalists at elite universities, is all that&#x27;s needed. See also my comment below about NPR listenership and trust in Amazon as an institution. Semi-off-topic but <i>Manufacturing Consent</i> really changed the way I see the world and think about media. As a kid I never questioned that Iraq War-era Time magazine article with diagrams of a mobile nuclear weapons facility. It should be required reading. Same for me.  Unfortunately, I found it hard to get along with some close relatives after my change in perspective. You just need to have influence over who hires the journalists. If they like you then they&#x27;ll hire people who will probably also like you. Are you unironically referencing Manufacturing Consent? &gt;&gt;&gt; We need to note that Amazon is an NPR funder.<p>&gt; You actually believe that Amazon has editorial control over NPR and specifically exerted that leverage to make this article incoherent?<p>You don&#x27;t have to have editorial control to have influence.<p>For instance: how smart would it be for you to complain about your employer in public forums under your own name?  People call that &quot;biting the hand that feeds you.&quot;  So even if you have a legitimate grievance or have witnessed clearly unethical behavior with your employer, maybe you decide to keep quiet because you need the money from your job.<p>Your employer just influenced what you write without having <i>any</i> editorial control over you. This is the story of our entire media. No, they didn&#x27;t line by line come in and edit the article, but any media outlet is going to self-censor to not lose a big sponsor. I think that&#x27;s pretty self-evident at this point. The classic Manufacturing Consent does a deep dive into this dynamic.<p>Related, newspapers are historically unprofitable. Why would someone like Jeff Bezos buy the Washington Post? Like any investment, he expects some kind of return. And the return in this case clearly isn&#x27;t direct revenue. Do you have any proof of that? Otherwise it&#x27;s just conspiracy theory. Sometimes people do things that don&#x27;t benefit them. It&#x27;s called charity. I don&#x27;t think that Bezos is a saint, but I also don&#x27;t think he bought the New York Post to be his mouthpiece nor would the editors allow it. I think you would find that the book or two hour YouTube documentary “Manufacturing Consent” by Noam Chomsky provides compelling answers to your questions. I do understand it can be irritating to hear “watch this two hour doc” as a response to an internet comment, but it really is a master work on the subject. I haven’t seen it in a few years so I can’t do its arguments justice, but it completely changed my views on how media works. I have been meaning to watch it again though.<p>For a different take there is a YouTube series from “Crash Course” on “media literacy” that I suspect goes over this, but I haven’t gotten that far in the series yet.<p>And then there’s also Michael Parenti, another author who has written and has YouTube talks on the subject.<p>Either way I just want to say it’s not wild conspiracy theory. It is an established body of work people are talking about here. NPR&#x27;s CEO previously was in charge of external propaganda: &quot;From 2015 to 2019, Lansing served as the CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the independent federal agency whose programming reaches an average weekly audience of 345 million people in 62 languages.&quot; [0] Now at NPR he coordinates internal propaganda. Angry Bezos emails will be career-shortening for NPR staff.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;people&#x2F;770270513&#x2F;john-lansing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;people&#x2F;770270513&#x2F;john-lansing</a> The implicit threat of loss of funding and&#x2F;or access is often enough to sway editorial decisions in a way that could appear like direct control. NPR is on the record [0] as not even informing their editorial staff of their 175+ sponsors, which causes other issues (for which there is actual evidence, which, while reasonable, I haven&#x27;t seen for your theory):<p>&gt; That lack of awareness has led to some embarrassments in the past.

They are, in other words, more interested in you than they are in NPR&#x27;s journalism.<p>&gt; The staff that sells sponsorships does not contact the newsroom to ask for coverage favor for a corporate client. To do so is a firing offense.<p>&gt; Companies and marketers almost universally know not to ask journalists for coverage favors in return for sponsorship and advertising. To do so would be an insult—like asking a professional journalist to be a prostitute. It would invite distrust and negative coverage. It also would undermine the independence that attracted NPR&#x27;s coveted audience in the first place.<p>&gt; &quot;Rote disclosures of every connection to a sponsor would not only clutter our programs, and be rendered meaningless in the process, but would also require producers to have an awareness of our corporate supporters that could actually be counter-productive and erode our firewall.&quot; There&#x27;s no need for anything so obvious as a request from the sposorship sales staff to the newsroom, or corporate sponsors asking journalists for favors. It could be an unspoken, unwritten understanding, subtle enough that the newsroom staff and journalists might honestly deny it exists. Just knowing that Amazon is a major sponsor of your employer (and hence, your job) is going to affect how you write about them, whether or not any overt favors have been requested. I mean this with all due respect, but highlighting NPR&#x27;s own defense of their editorial practices is hardly convincing.<p>NPR routinely runs editorial pieces that were pitched to them by corporate sponsors or their fronts like think tanks.  They likewise have have discussion panels featuring these groups&#x27; talking heads. Listen to a few episodes of Marketplace if you want the most obvious corporate propaganda imaginable. Their impartiality is laughable. Just to be precise, Marketplace is not produced by NPR.<p>It is produced by American Public Media, which is a branch of Minnesota Public Radio (and Southern California Public Radio).<p>Perhaps you meant &quot;US public radio&quot; in general, but said &quot;NPR&quot;. They are not equivalent, however. It&#x27;s a distinction without any real difference. You could make the same argument about Planet Money, an NPR show, that went out of the way to provide cover for the banks during the financial crisis, had their host attack Elizabeth Warren in an interview, all while taking money from the same industry. Adam Davidson (the host who attacked Warren) of course then also went on to collect all kinds of &quot;speaking fees&quot; from financial institutions.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shameproject.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;adam-davidson&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shameproject.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;adam-davidson&#x2F;</a><p>NPR, despite what the parent linked, does almost nothing to police these conflicts. It&#x27;s a distinction with a difference. And no, I could not make the same argument about Planet Money, since that show <i>is</i> produced by NPR.<p>If you say &quot;American public radio&quot;, do you also include Democracy Now? Do you include shows produced by other local stations, including the ones that do not get distributed? NPR is not the totality of &quot;American public radio&quot;.<p>Understanding the structure of public broadcasting in the USA is critical to understand why it works the way that it does. NPR is a distinct organization, even from CPB (Corporation for Public Broadcasting), even if its sensibilities are echoed in other public radio organizations (like MPR&#x2F;APM).<p>As for your points about Adam Davidson, I don&#x27;t find that shameproject.com page particularly persuasive. It&#x27;s clear that Davidson&#x27;s worldview does not align with that of the people&#x2F;person who wrote the page&#x2F;manages the site. I don&#x27;t find this particularly remarkable or even particularly interesting. Davidson&#x27;s worldview doesn&#x27;t really line up with my own either. But there&#x27;s a bunch of stuff on that page (the quotes in particular) which lack context, and a lot of other stuff that consists mostly of deeply subjective assessments and assignment of motive to Davidson without much evidence. Not taking money from the people you’re covering is the barest minimum of journalistic ethics. Regardless, of whether you or I agree with anything else on that site, Adam Davidson, or whoever else, failing to meet that basic standard should be patently disqualifying. The fact that he was the host of a flagship, economic reporting show, even more so.<p>There are many other reasons I find it hard to take NPR’s claims of impartiality seriously, but this one is so glaringly wrong that it speaks for itself. I don&#x27;t accept anyone&#x27;s claims of impartiality. This notion of objective journalism is a US disease, and it needs to be stamped out as rapidly and as widely as possible. I view NPR as an excellent source of reporting on &quot;people&#x27;s lives as they experience them&quot; and &quot;the political status quo&quot;. I would never dream of considering NPR to be how I found out about ideas and practices outside of the political status quo - that&#x27;s just not what they (or any other mainstream media) does. &quot;<i>Listen to a few episodes of Marketplace if you want the most obvious corporate propaganda imaginable.</i>&quot;<p>You mean NPR&#x27;s business news show? That&#x27;s what business news is, right? If you read something like the Financial Times, it’s actually far less propagandistic than most “business news.” It mostly just reports the raw, unfiltered reality of Capitalist exchange. There are actually quite a few Marxists who like the paper for this reason.<p>When contrasted with something like Marketplace, which ceaselessly and glibly spins the darker realities of our economy to somehow be “upbeat” or “positive,” the difference becomes more obvious. And this is an editorial and ideological choice made by NPR, pursuing this framing. &gt; prostitute<p>I expected better than NPR. They could have just said &quot;like asking a professional journalist to be a PR agent&quot;. Who needs to be coherent or honest when you can thrill your listeners by smearing some company you both already hate? Things like honesty and integrity are wicked when they fail to serve the cause; this is a time for deliberate obfuscation!<p>— npr, probably<p>Geez, guys. There&#x27;s so many <i>good</i> reasons to go after Amazon; you&#x27;d think one of them would be enough, but nooooo. Amazon was recently polled to be the most trusted institution among US Democrats [0], which comprises the majority of NPR&#x27;s listenership and donors. They know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aicpoll.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aicpoll.com&#x2F;</a> Two points here at least worth footnoting:<p>(1) That poll is from July 2018, and while that&#x27;s technically recent, in terms of news about big tech that can affect perceptions, a lot&#x27;s happened in the last two years.<p>(2) According to the poll, Amazon was the third most-trusted institution among US Republicans, just behind &quot;military&quot; and &quot;local police&quot;, and was the second-most trusted institution behind the military across all respondents. I think you&#x27;re putting more emphasis on partisan affiliation here with respect to Amazon than the data warrants. That, or, Amazon knows from history (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, even going as far back as Standard Oil) that the public trust is not to be taken for granted. They have strong incentives to stay ahead of any negative sentiment that might arise. This isn&#x27;t a quality article, but it&#x27;s not lying.<p>There have been sporadic reports for about a year of major hiring&#x2F;contracting related to internal security and union activity. EG: publicly posted positions that said the &quot;quite part out loud,&quot; anonymous whistleblowers and some leaked docs.<p>I think this article specifically relates to a report by motherboard a week or two ago where they got emails leaked to them from Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Global Security Operations Center.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a better article by Vice. They Pinkerton hire seems to have been confirmed by amazon spokesperson.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports...</a><p><i>&quot;Internal emails sent to Amazon&#x27;s Global Security Operations Center obtained by Motherboard reveal that all the division&#x27;s team members around the world receive updates on labor organizing activities at warehouses that include the exact date, time, location, the source who reported the action, the number of participants at an event (and in some cases a turnout rate of those expected to participate in a labor action)&quot;</i> It just astounds me that the Old Timey Pinkertons are still around, to be honest. That is a company that my 98 year old grandfather tells stories about from his childhood.<p>I know there are other old companies, but Pinkerton is one of those that just sounds old fashioned. They&#x27;re owned by Securitas today, the Swedish security guard company. Which makes the decision to continue using &quot;Pinkerton&quot; as a _brand name_ even more of an intimidation tactic, IMO. And I think it ultimately results in demonstrating how committed Bezos is to fighting this. Same here. I&#x27;m a high school student; I learned about the Pinkertons last year in US History...

Just because companies have been trying to prevent organization of their labor for over a century doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t still messed up now. It&#x27;s easy to say that it&#x27;s just the way the world works from your desk, the people who are forced to work in Amazon&#x27;s warehouses with terrible working conditions don&#x27;t have that luxury. “What did you expect?” is my least favorite conversational trope (it’s more disappointing on HN because in general I have higher expectations here, but it’s common everywhere).<p>On the surface it sounds smart and world-weary. As an actual part of a conversation, whether something is expected is pretty orthogonal to whether, say, something would ideally be done about it.<p>I suppose it is relevant to whether something makes good content, but hopefully most of us aren’t here primarily to comment on our judgment of content marketability<p>I think the most common place I see it is with surveillance conversations<p>Though I should note that I’m not seeing those comments towards the top anymore, so that’s good I love the common tropes, you only have to learn a single response that allows you to control the narrative.<p>&gt; What did you expect?<p>Well, geez, I don&#x27;t know basic human decency probably? Are we all so numb to asshattery that we&#x27;re not surprised or upset when we learn about someone using power to hurt or control the little guy? &gt; Well, geez, I don&#x27;t know basic human decency probably?<p>Oh sweetheart, if you expect that under a capitalist system... or really any system run by human nature. &gt; Oh sweetheart<p>This should also be on the list of annoying conversational tropes. Agreed This brand of cynicism where you claim that everything is expected can also be a way to protect yourself from negative information. If you care about say privacy and you constantly receive news about surveillance, it can be disheartening, so it&#x27;s easier to dismiss the news with &quot;well, what did you expect?&quot;. I know I used to do that, in my head at least. I&#x27;m not advocating for cynicism of course, just saying that people might be doing it for deeper reasons than sounding smart and world-weary. &gt; “What did you expect?” is my least favorite conversational trope (it’s more disappointing on HN because in general I have higher expectations here, but it’s common everywhere).<p>&gt; On the surface it sounds smart and world-weary. As an actual part of a conversation, whether something is expected is pretty orthogonal to whether, say, something would ideally be done about it.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty much just a lazy dismissal of the issue, and maybe even an attempt to jam up the discussion. Speaking with my wallet. I no longer use Amazon.<p>Though my employer users AWS. I don&#x27;t have any swing over that sadly.<p>But for my own money, no more Amazon. I have stopped ordering from amazon.com but do still use AWS. I should probably evaluate other cloud providers, when I made the decision to use AWS about 5 years ago there were no other providers that offered all the functionality I wanted. It was also easy enough to throw a rock and hit a certified aws consultant. At this point the cloud provider that is the least shitty as a company is probably... Microsoft? Damn what has the world come to My company is on DigitalOcean, but we&#x27;re not exactly web scale yet, so I can&#x27;t vouch for them on that level. Their support is nice and responsive, though, and their management interface is very nice. They don&#x27;t do everything AWS do, e.g., they only just added an S3-compatible object store and I&#x27;ve yet to come across anything like secrets management or IAM for their virtual machines. Our prototype was on DigitalOcean but we started collecting issues and feature requests that were solved more easily by AWS. Including IAM, we were an early adopter of S3, it&#x27;s a great product. Now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, I&#x27;m going to open an issue to evaluate the other cloud providers. But honestly, the team is going to hate me, they have all spent a lot of time learning AWS. &gt; But honestly, the team is going to hate me, they have all spent a lot of time learning AWS.<p>This was another motivation for going with DO: there&#x27;s just less of it. Less to learn, less to get lost in. We&#x27;ve got a couple of juniors on the team who are brand new to actually having to get the software they write to run in production, and I don&#x27;t think the AWS control panel is a very good place to send someone like that. It&#x27;s pretty easy to avoid Amazon if you are Frugal. Walmart online is cheaper.<p>Most people are too lazy to look at another store. Is Walmart really that great by comparison ? I wonder what skeletons are up their closet. For those who identify strongly with unions, union-busting stuff like this is triggering... like &quot;bringing up the war&quot; in a war traumatised nation.<p>I get that. But... 2020 isn&#x27;t 1920 or even 1980. Fresh eyes might see more clearly.<p>To the advantage of union organisers, mass communication and organisation is a lot easier today. Surveillance is easier too. IDK. Yes, Bezos does not want an amazon union and won&#x27;t just let it happen without a fight. Same as always. That said, if people want to hear what an amazon union organiser has to say... it&#x27;s almost impossible to stop it.<p>I don&#x27;t think the central factor here is Pinkertons. Union organising is the actual determinant. If they can get enough amazon employees interested, they&#x27;ll probably succeed regardless. &gt; Yes, Bezos does not want an amazon union and won&#x27;t just let it happen without a fight. Same as always.<p>Which is, if I recalled correctly, illegal. Law is meaningless when there are a lot of money&#x2F;power involved. After all it&#x27;s the ruling class who made them. While true, it need not. be this way. Elite rich american failure to follow the letter and spirit of the law trickles down way faster then economics. Not in democracies. It does make it somewhat harder though. Democracies or not, regardless, I think the key for citizens is to have both a scientific mind as well as a fighting spirit. Lack of either would be a disaster.<p>So that it&#x27;s pretty costly for the ruling class to push ordinary people around. Not that they can&#x27;t, I mean they still control the army and police so technically they can still do whatever they want, but in reality it&#x27;s going to be very expensive, financially and politically to push people around if ordinary people possess both qualities. Didn&#x27;t stop Google from firing two employees in regards to union organizing. It doesn&#x27;t matter what they did, if the NLRB is backing the employees, the company is in the wrong. Having to wait for a government agency to respond to your case of being wrongfully terminated is a PITA as it is. The fact that they determined the employee was conducting protected behavior which Google actively disagrees with just goes to show these companies are so large they&#x27;re more than willing to just eliminate union organizers and wait for the government to tell them they broke the law as opposed to ensuring they follow it in the first place. See also Google conspiring to suppress worker wages for many years until they were caught and given a slap on the wrist. For those who are not familiar, Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Pixar, Lucasfilm and eBay all colluded with one another to keep tech worker compensation below its market value[1].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_L...</a> &gt; <i>Which is, if I recalled correctly, illegal</i><p>Retaliation against employees is illegal. Shutting down a unionised facility is not. Maybe in spirit.<p>In reality, bezos and any future amazon union are opposed to one another. That&#x27;s a pretty firmly embedded truism in union thinking too. No point getting outraged over the trite.<p>Also, this is not even amazon getting serious yet. Imagine what happens when&#x2F;if amazon union organisers ever make a credible effort. Don&#x27;t underestimate what a desperate individual will do when they&#x27;ve lost everything to Bezos greed. Not if you&#x27;re rich Maybe, but that doesn&#x27;t make it right, and it won&#x27;t change unless people are aware of it and fight against it, which is why this article is pointing it. Depends how you fight. Some union busting tactics are illegal, others legal and a few skirt the borders of illegality.<p>Even if they do do it illegally, the justice department has to be motivated to go after them. Which, with a Biden administration that is close to Bezos is unlikely:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-tech&#x2F;amazon-and-big-tech-cozy-up-to-biden-camp-with-cash-and-connections-idINKBN26M5O2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-tech&#x2F;amazon-...</a><p>These workers can&#x27;t really rely on the justice Department. &gt;Which is, if I recalled correctly, illegal.<p>Entirely legal in a &quot;Right to work&quot; state. Down vote me all you want, its 100% the truth.\nDon&#x27;t like it? Contact your representatives in the state legislature and get these laws repealed. If employees know that discussing unionizing or showing any pro-union tendency or behavior is going to arm their career prospects (or maybe even make them lose their job altogether) it&#x27;s definitely going to be a lot harder for them to organize.<p>I can&#x27;t believe people here people here manage to justify this abject behavior as &quot;business as usual&quot;. This is not normal, not legal and shouldn&#x27;t be accepted. It’s HN. Every time there’s an article about FB going too far, everyone seems to chime in about how FB is evil and anyone who works there must be evil as well, “so what did you expect?” It’s the same with Amazon or any FAANG company, and it gets quite tiring sometimes. I don&#x27;t think facebook is evil. It&#x27;s just run by a naive dictator who isn&#x27;t willing to make the tough decisions that will allow democracy to continue. The intentions aren&#x27;t bad but the outcome is horrible. Evil is what evil does. Tough ask for an average warehouse employee to practice enough opsec to hide the talks from Amazon. Harder still, if they retain Pinkerton agents to spy on you even after you clock out [1]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports...</a> &gt; To the advantage of union organisers, mass communication and organisation is a lot easier today.<p>But that&#x27;s a double-edged sword.  It&#x27;s also an advantage to <i>employers and businesses</i>.  And recent history has shown they have the advantage: they been successful at thwarting union formation (see Wal-Mart, the movie American Factory, etc.) and even labor laws (e.g. Prop 22). Well if you thwart union formation and legislation by using communication to persuade people that you&#x27;re right and to vote for your side, that&#x27;s called democracy. &gt;  Well if you thwart union formation and legislation by using communication to persuade people that you&#x27;re right and to vote for your side, that&#x27;s called democracy.<p>That&#x27;s neither here nor there.  The point I was disputing was the idea that changes in mass communication technology gives an advantage to unions.<p>However, to your point: your phrasing &quot;using communication to persuade people...to vote for your side, that&#x27;s called democracy,&quot; obscures some important distinctions.  If your success at persuasion stems mainly from the greater power you have to project your message (e.g. via wealth), then that&#x27;s arguably not actually very democratic.  That&#x27;s pretty easy to see when greater <i>political</i> power is used (e.g. the CCP suppressing dissenting voices and successfully persuading the people with a thick blanket of weakly-opposed propaganda), but there&#x27;s a similar dynamic when one side can greatly outspend its opponent, since wealth is a kind of power [1].<p>For a union vote, the employer typically has both greater wealth and greater political power: it can blanket the workplace with anti-union messages and require employees to <i>repeatedly</i> attend anti-union &quot;education&quot; sessions during work hours (which is typical before a union vote), while the union organizers have much more limited access, and must try to reach employees <i>outside</i> of work.<p>[1] this is an area of tension in liberal democracy, where trade-offs need to be made. That’s  called propaganda, not democracy. &gt;I don&#x27;t think the central factor here is Pinkertons. Union organising is the actual determinant.<p>&quot;If you didn&#x27;t want to be spied-on, you wouldn&#x27;t try to unionize&quot;?  Really? I didn&#x27;t say it isn&#x27;t a factor. I said determining factor. &gt; To the advantage of union organisers, mass communication and organisation is a lot easier today. Surveillance is easier too.<p>For those of us who are working from home due to the pandemic (or other reasons), we don&#x27;t have any way to communicate with our co-workers except via electronic channels that can be logged.<p>Pre-covid, one could reasonably expect that if one were to mention unionization in conversation over lunch, there wouldn&#x27;t be a permanent electronic record of it.  Now, it&#x27;s just not something you can discreetly discuss with someone unless you have their outside-of-work contact information. The situation is what it is.<p>That said &quot;communicating via electronic channels&quot; is not an insurmountable problem. It could be turned into and advantage. If union organizers post a letter, video or whatnot... amazon employees can see it. If people want to sign up to an unsurveiled &quot;stream,&quot; they can.<p>The reality of secrecy and anonymity are what they are. Amazon are feisty, but they aren&#x27;t the KGB. Secrecy is hard, probably unattainable. Anonymity is doable, but not default. Circulation is easy, assuming recipients are into it. etc. &gt; It&#x27;s easy to say that it&#x27;s just the way the world works from your desk,<p>Its equally easy to be disappointed and show some virtual outrage via social media. To me if office workers are not putting their money where their mouth then it is not of much consequence whether they are disappointed or world weary. it&#x27;s not just the way the world works. it&#x27;s the way capitalism works. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unfair for people to be fed up with watching these things happen while the root causes continue to be largely taken for granted. It&#x27;s not even the way that capitalism works. It&#x27;s the way that unproperly regulated capitalism works The way that capitalism works is to prevent proper regulation. No, that&#x27;s just the American model of capitalism. The rest of the world has a lot more balanced approach. The interesting thing about moderation of this comment (and please note this isn&#x27;t a complaint about the moderation) is that it was up-voted heavily when during Western European office hours then down-voted heavily during SV office hours, which is a correlation to the different cultural opinions I&#x27;ve also observed between SV and Europe when it comes to discussions regarding capitalism. ...so far. Other countries have some mechanisms - legal and cultural - in place that have resisted the creep of capitalist power concentration better than the U.S. has. But I&#x27;m pessimistic - I think globally we&#x27;ll continue to see taxes cut, social safety nets dried up, and privatization of benefits, like has been happening in the UK. It just seems to be the tendency of capitalism.<p>edit: I invite downvoters to let me know why they disagree, besides &quot;capitalism good&quot; The ironic thing about the UK is we are seeing the same people advocating deregulation at the national level, while also campaigning for greater government intervention at the local level.<p>Or at least that&#x27;s been the general sentiment I&#x27;ve seen in many of the Tory strongholds in the counties surrounding London. this is always the right-wing rhetorical contradiction:<p>&quot;less government!&quot;... when it comes to limiting the power of capital, and redistributing its profits to society<p>&quot;more government!!&quot; when it comes to squashing dissent to capital and existing hierarchies<p>it&#x27;s not really a contradiction, it&#x27;s part of a consistent authoritarian ideology ruled by capital and other oppressive social structures, but it is outwardly hypocritical and often goes against the interests of the people who parrot it &quot;Because capitalism&quot; is always a terrible argument, whatever your position.<p>It&#x27;s a very nebulous term.  Does it mean free markets?  Does it mean private ownership of the factors of production?  Does it mean laissez-faire?  Does it mean economic organization of a professional manager class, with management separated from ownership, and ownership characterized by tradeable claims on assets? It has a specific definition that you can find by googling: &quot;an economic and political system in which a country&#x27;s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t assume that others are naive, imprecise, or uninformed about what capitalism is and how it affects the world, just because your own understanding of it is limited.[0]<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a> Googling.  Got it.<p>Wow, what a time saver I wish I had known about that earlier. My point is not that googling it will reveal everything about it, but nice bad faith. My point is it has a dictionary definition and there are plenty of people who understand what it is. It is not a nebulous concept just because you aren&#x27;t informed about it.<p>If you want to get started learning about it, I recommend looking up Richard Wolff I must not have been clear, because you seem to have missed my point.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that capitalism is a nebulous concept because I am not informed about it.  I believe it is a nebulous concept because I have actually witnessed people in arguments using it to mean different things.  Some people consider capitalism as simply a rhetorical foil to Marxism.  Some people consider capitalism an economy that while capital is private, the economy may be mercantilist.  Others insist that free trade is part and parcel of capitalism. Etc., etc.  That&#x27;s all I meant.<p>And there&#x27;s a (not small) difference between bad faith and sarcasm.  And tossing around Dunning-Krueger after one extremely shallow interaction is the height of irony. when you say &#x27;&quot;because capitalism&quot; is always a terrible argument&#x27;, you&#x27;re doing more than observing that it&#x27;s used nebulously sometimes, you&#x27;re saying that by definition it cannot be used unnebulously, which is just false and is what I was responding to.<p>Your original comment was aggressive but I admit quoting Dunning Kruger, while not misplaced, was also aggressive and escalatory. Agree that the root cause here is not Amazon, it&#x27;s a system (unregulated capitalism) that incentives this behavior. I think it&#x27;s still fair to criticize actors in such a system, especially if such criticism is done with the context that these companies and their bad actions are the product of that system and that it would be positive for most of the workforce for that system to be better regulated. Unregulated?  American unions are tightly regulated: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act</a> &gt; the people who are forced to work in Amazon&#x27;s warehouses<p>Who is being forced? Many people don&#x27;t have the job flexibility and choice that many of us on HN have and are forced to take any available employment or go homeless. It really is amazing that people really refuse to understand how freaking privileged we are to have good pay, good mobility and the reality of people who don&#x27;t. Competition for &quot;unskilled&quot;, ugh I hate that word, jobs is fierce and when you&#x27;re living on the verge of homelessness you have neither the time nor money to invest in yourself. People that cannot find a better alternative in their current personal situation.\nSure they are not &quot;forced&quot; in a precise linguistic sense. But when it&#x27;s this or nothing there is really just an illusion of choice. Why is it Amazon’s problem that they have no alternative?<p>If Amazon went away, would their situation be better or worse?<p>I believe that as a society we must ensure that people have enough money to live, but why should the employers on the bottom of the skills spectrum be forced to bear the brunt of it?<p>Every employer should be required by law to provide a safe workplace free of discrimination and harassment.   But hiring unskilled workers at a market wage doesn’t make you a bad actor. Because Amazon are use their disproportionate position of power to abuse these employees. It is far from an even playing field. This very article we&#x27;re commenting on shows that Amazon are trying hard to keep it from becoming fair and equal. I find your lack of compassion for underprivileged employees astounding.<p>&gt; Every employer should be required by law to provide a safe workplace free of discrimination and harassment.<p>And who is going to sue when they are underpaid and have no other job options available? Litigation is time consuming and expensive and rent won&#x27;t wait. Your question was literally &quot;who is being forced?&quot; I responded to that and nothing more.<p>&gt; But hiring unskilled workers at a market wage doesn’t make you a bad actor.<p>No, but artificially preventing the market conditions (wage + others) from raising by blocking people&#x27;s basic right of association will make you a bad actor. If given a free choice of literally anything they could do to contribute to the world, do you think Amazon warehouse employees would put Amazon warehouse work as their primary choice? Something they said they wanted to do &quot;when they grow up&quot;? &quot;Something with dehumanising conditions, please!&quot;<p>If not, what is your answer to the quesiton &quot;why are they doing this job at all&quot;?<p>Because they have to do something, and this is the best they can do? Then &quot;have to do something&quot; is the force, and they are the forced. So by offering an alternative better than any other available, Amazon is the bad guy?  What about all the companies not offering them alternatives? I didn&#x27;t say &quot;Amazon is the (one and only) bad guy&quot;, or anything about bad guys at all. I said &quot;if they aren&#x27;t opting out, there is a force compelling them to be there&quot;.<p>You say &quot;who is forcing them? Why don&#x27;t they quit?&quot; and yet ... they don&#x27;t quit, and you (apparently?) think there is no reason why.<p>I don&#x27;t think the force is a single person or company. I think it&#x27;s the economic and social system we live in has become (intentionally or not) tuned to keep as many people as desperate as it can, because those are the kind of people who will work longer and harder for less money. They used to offer them alternatives but Amazon put those companies out of business. The idea that it’s Amazon or homelessness doesn’t really make Amazon look better. You’re mixing the general and the specific. Specifically yes, you don’t have to work for Amazon, but in general yes you are in fact forced to work or die in a capitalist system. In some situations Amazon may be the only viable employer. &quot;but in general yes you are in fact forced to work or die in a capitalist system&quot;<p>registered an account just to inform you what an utter crap of a statement you&#x27;ve made there. since i&#x27;ve bothered thus far, i made it a point to review more of your presence here. the conclusion i&#x27;ve come to is you are quite the twat. in a most general sense - a cunt of the dunning-kruger variety. Where do we draw the line? What tactics are ok for a company to use to combat unions if it doesn&#x27;t want them? Or should companies just accept and work with any union that forms? &gt; What tactics are ok for a company to use to combat unions if it doesn&#x27;t want them?<p>They don&#x27;t have a right to combat them at all. Union organizing is literally a human right. Of course ownership doesn&#x27;t want them -- the feelings of ownership are (supposed to be) irrelevant. &gt; They don&#x27;t have a right to combat them at all.<p>This is simply not true. Amazon have a right to argue against unionisation in order to combat it. It really amazes me what some people think qualifies for a “human right”. If you are paying someone and they are doing something you told them not to do isn’t it your “human right” to stop paying them? Where do you draw the line with what a “human right” is? Think about it this way: both sides have the right to freely negotiate a contract, and then decide whether or not to enter into it. The CEO can&#x27;t prevent the workers from talking to each other and figuring out what they think a fair contract would be, and the workers can&#x27;t prevent the CEO from talking to other CEOs for the same reason.<p>The specific human right is usually referred to as &quot;freedom of association&quot;. You can read more here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_association\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_association</a> As you observe, workers talking to each other to agree on prices for labor is the flip side of the coin from CEOs talking to each other to agree on prices for labor. But the latter is in fact illegal. CEOs can&#x27;t talk to each other and agree to pay $10&#x2F;hour for warehouse workers. Coordinating with others to set prices for labor or goods isn&#x27;t viewed as within the scope of freedom of association. Union activities are in fact specifically exempted from anti-trust laws because otherwise they would fall within the scope of them. Workers can agree with each other not to accept less than $15&#x2F;hour for warehouse workers.<p>You need something more than freedom of association to justify unions, rooted in the recognition of bargaining disparities between employers and employees. The way I&#x27;m thinking about it, you don&#x27;t need anything extra to justify unions, but you do need something extra to prohibit wage fixing. I agree that freedom of association, when considered alone, would allow wage fixing and price fixing and all sorts of anti-competitive behavior.<p>We&#x27;re moving away from areas where I&#x27;m confident I know what I&#x27;m talking about, but I think as a society we&#x27;ve decided that while anti-competitive laws do infringe on the rights of business leaders, we&#x27;re trying to balance their rights with those of everyone else, and the laws are necessary to prevent a permanent class divide between business leaders who cannot be challenged, and workers under them. In the long run, allowing complete free association among CEOs would limit the freedoms of the rest of society.<p>Society is a constant project of balancing various conflicting rights, and this is one of many cases where we limit the rights of a few to defend the rights of many. You don&#x27;t see any power disparity here? I do. But power disparity doesn’t have anything to do with freedom of association. It’s a different basis for allowing unionization. You&#x27;ve got it the wrong way round. You start by assuming everything is permitted and then you selectively (and ideally reluctantly) bring the weight of law to bear when you discover that it&#x27;s a net benefit to society. It&#x27;s a correction for gross inequalities of power.<p>That&#x27;s something the libertarian left and libertarian right surely agree on - minimising the application of the monopoly of force and all that.<p>So you assume both employers and employees can freely organize and associate. That&#x27;s your starting point.<p>Now - we&#x27;ve decided that the right to join a union should be protected (it evens out an existing power imbalance) and that collusion to force down wages should be illegal (because it amplifies an existing power imbalance to the detriment of society at large) But we have to realise that the common situation here is a corporation against a single individual. How is it comparable to a cartel of corporations? Sure but if both sides have the human right to freely associate, then the employer should surely have the right to reject associating with the union at all. But that&#x27;s not afforded to them under US law, per my understanding. &quot;Associate&quot; has a specific definition here that&#x27;s a little narrower than normal conversation. It refers to being a member of a group, not just being connected to it in some way. The CEO is free to not join the union if they don&#x27;t want to. They can also quit if they don&#x27;t want to deal with it at all. By the same token, the company’s management is free to fight union creation, by sharing anti-union messages. Freedom of speech and assembly on both sides. Agreed, but in the American context, &quot;fighting&quot; union creation usually means a little more than just sharing informative messages. &quot;I heard Donny got both kneecaps busted after he passed out a union flyer last year&quot; said the manager conveniently holding a baseball bat from the &quot;baseball club&quot; he just so happened to be involved in. I think this is legally the case in most places, but IMO it is extremely unfair to give ownership acting through the corporate entity the same rights as employees, which are actual people. Sure. the complaint here is not that Amazon shared anti-union messages. (and gets murky when it tries to force employees to consume said messages) You are paying someone to work 18 hours a day, every day. They would like to not work 18 hours a day anymore, and stop working at a mere 12 hours; they are even willing to accept less pay. You fire them, because you clearly told them not to do that. They organize with other workers and demand the right for a 12 hour day, with this right enshrined in law and with penalties for employers who do not comply. You say “they are free to work for someone else or quit if they don’t like it!”<p>Fast forward many decades later. This is a right you and I both enjoy. (This is also why we both have time to shitpost on HN.) If there was a serious proposal to take it away, you and I would probably be standing side by side on the street demanding our rights back.<p>It’s easy to talk a big game about human rights when your rights aren’t on the line. * Where do you draw the line with what a “human right” is?*<p>By looking into the declaration of human rights: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;</a> Which is even more unenforceable than the 4th amendment. It still has value even if enforcement is imperfect and selective. In the real world, &quot;rights&quot; are not inalienable. I mean, who among the lower classes wrote the US constitution? Not a single one. That&#x27;s because it was written by the bourgeoisie who were protecting their interests. Who do these people, the &quot;United Nations&quot;, writing their &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights,&quot; think they are with declaring union organizing a human right?  (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;</a> - article 23)<p>FWIW, You can pick out any other number of declarations of human rights and the right to form and join trade unions is in them. It&#x27;s very widely considered to be a human right, not some fringe thing. &gt; If you are paying someone and they are doing something you told them not to do isn’t it your “human right” to stop paying them?<p>Obviously not. Real-world cases in point:<p>* Firing people for being queer<p>* Firing people for objecting to sexual harassment<p>* Firing people for going to the bathroom Just to add, most of the bathroom related ones are other employees complaining, not management. Management has to respond to that. This is because US culture insists on separate gender bathrooms. In the context of Amazon, though, performance quotas are inhumane, warehouses are huge, bathrooms are sparse, so employees aren&#x27;t able to use the bathroom without taking performance demerits.  So you get people passing out due to dehydration because they don&#x27;t want to need the bathroom. If Mr. Bezos wants to operate a business in a country, he needs to follow its laws. If he doesn&#x27;t like them, he can take his business somewhere else. Easier just to change the law. Its in the UN declaration of human rights and also if you think about it, in the Declaration of Independence.<p>&quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot; &gt; <i>Its in the UN declaration of human rights</i><p>This is, legally speaking, a meaningless document. So is the Declaration of Independence. So is Matthew 5. What&#x27;s your point? His point is it doesn&#x27;t matter what you are &quot;guaranteed&quot; simply because if the real world was so black and white in regards to how laws were interpreted and followed, we wouldn&#x27;t be having these arguments. &gt; What tactics are ok for a company to use to combat unions if it doesn&#x27;t want them?<p>In the US they could improve working conditions to the point that employees are happy with the status quo. Unionisation efforts are typically driven by employees who are stressed by unhealthy&#x2F;unsafe working environments, employee mistreatment, or poor pay. We see the opposite of this in the tech sector, where decent pay, safe environments and plenty of benefits leads to a rather union hostile attitude.<p>&gt; Or should companies just accept and work with any union that forms?<p>If we accept that unions act to address the power imbalance between employees and employers and unionisation is mainly driven by employers exploiting that power imbalance then I think it&#x27;s both good for society and in line with the spirit of the laws that exist in many places that make various forms of union busting illegal. In most Western countries, workers have a right to form unions.<p>So yes, companies have to accept it. At the same time in most Western countries decent working conditions and wages are already mandated by law. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the situation in the US but in Europe that means that conditions cannot be horrible to start with if the company acts within the law (which would be expected of a company like Amazon, but maybe I&#x27;m optimistic).<p>Unions are a way to negotiate a better deal than the legal minimum for unskilled labour. &gt; At the same time in most Western countries decent working conditions and wages are already mandated by law<p>Are they though?  There are a plethora of activist, legal, legislative groups focused on both working conditions (often on narrower groups, like say migrant farm labor) and minimum wage issues would probably argue this.<p>Obviously working condition protections are much better than they were before 1950s-ish, and the existence of a minimum wage is greater than zero (where applicable).  But neither of those inherently meet a bar as fuzzy as &quot;decent&quot;. &gt; <i>here are a plethora of activist, legal, legislative groups focused on both working conditions (often on narrower groups, like say migrant farm labor) and minimum wage issues would probably argue this.</i><p>That&#x27;s right and most of their work in Western Europe is helping workers <i>enforce</i> the law. Do companies have a right to circulate anti-union material, to have anti-union speakers come to work, etc? Depends on the country but _tentatively_ yes, America has a infamously anti-union, anti-worker history though so there&#x27;s significantly more holdover of it actually happening, what most other countries don&#x27;t have is services like the Pinkertons, previously a literally rifle-armed military&#x2F;police force for the purposes of seeking out and often murdering union leaders and breaking up strikes by force.<p>What I was taught was that generally most older countries already had established police forces that wouldn&#x27;t allow groups like the Pinkertons to exist by the time the union movement came along where America didn&#x27;t and instead their police actually came _from_ groups like the Pinkertons.<p>But I&#x27;d take that with a grain of salt given that it was second hand summarized information even when I first got it. It is basically correct that the US police descend from a mixture of slave patrol remnants and strikebusters near the late 19th &#x2F; beginning of the 20th century (though sometimes in opposition to them, the initial state police ranks were still largely drawn from private police, racist &quot;town watches&quot;, and militia forces).<p>England and the rest of the Anglosphere adopted what are often called &quot;Peelian principles,&quot; focused on policing by community consent, 50+ years earlier than that. Do you have sources on any of these? In the &#x27;defunding&#x27; era, I often see this claim about the origins of police but a) it seems unlikely to be generalized (police forces in the Northern states are obviously not derived from &quot;slave patrol remnants&quot; and b) it seems irrelevant since whatever the police was in the past doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what it is today and it doesn&#x27;t mean the goals or the culture are the same. In the North, rich merchants socialized the costs of the guards they hired to protect their assets in port cities through municipalization. In the South, that wasn&#x27;t the case, and the police are direct descendants from slave patrols.<p>From Time&#x27;s &quot;How the U.S. Got Its Police Force&quot;[1]:<p>&gt; <i>The first publicly funded, organized police force with officers on duty full-time was created in Boston in 1838. Boston was a large shipping commercial center, and businesses had been hiring people to protect their property and safeguard the transport of goods from the port of Boston to other places, says Potter. These merchants came up with a way to save money by transferring to the cost of maintaining a police force to citizens by arguing that it was for the “collective good.”</i><p>&gt; <i>In the South, however, the economics that drove the creation of police forces were centered not on the protection of shipping interests but on the preservation of the slavery system.</i><p>With regard to police originating from strike breakers, that&#x27;s also true.<p>&gt; <i>For example, businessmen in the late 19th century had both connections to politicians and an image of the kinds of people most likely to go on strike and disrupt their workforce. So it’s no coincidence that by the late 1880s, all major U.S. cities had police forces. Fears of labor-union organizers and of large waves of Catholic, Irish, Italian, German, and Eastern European immigrants, who looked and acted differently from the people who had dominated cities before, drove the call for the preservation of law and order, or at least the version of it promoted by dominant interests.</i><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4779112&#x2F;police-history-origins&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4779112&#x2F;police-history-origins&#x2F;</a> heavyset_go has provided a good source for my more general statements but I want to specifically address<p>&gt; police forces in the Northern states are obviously not derived from &quot;slave patrol remnants&quot;<p>This is a common misconception that the north was &quot;free&quot; even as the south kept enslaving people. It&#x27;s true that the north also had other economic forces influencing its policing, but the Fugitive Slave Acts gave plenty of legal cover for anyone wanting to make a buck by finding &quot;escaped slaves&quot; (often just whatever black people they found) in the north. Yes, they do. Don&#x27;t force your workers to work in dangerous conditions with low pay and no voice in their work place, and maybe they wouldn&#x27;t want to form a union. What if I don&#x27;t do any of those things?<p>What if I run the most worker-centric paradise, with employee empowerment, great wages, benefits and conditions?<p>And what if the national organization of an umbrella labor organization considers my non-union workforce as a threat to both their budget and their political power?  And what if they provide materials and advisors promoting unionization, despite the fact that they are acting in the interest of the union organization itself, and not the workers they hope to represent? If you “ran” the most worker-centric paradise, you’d be the elected CEO of a co-op where the workers had democratic control of the means of production. In such a place, there’d of course be no need for a union because the workers would have the say in what happens already.<p>Now your strawman benevolent dictatorship could never exist since you would still be denying workers control over their workplace. Thus they may form a union to fight for that control. If you are such a wonderful, caring employer what difference would it make if your employees were unionised?  I think that part of the problem here is that the history of unions and union busting in the US <i>appears</i> to be one of corruption on both sides; but this is not a necessary or inevitable feature of unionisation. Sure, that could happen. Are you trying to argue that an employer should have a 100% right to have a union-free workplace? &gt; What tactics are ok for a company to combat unions?<p>None. This is a legally protected right. &gt; None.<p>This isn&#x27;t a true statement.<p>Companies are allowed to argue against unionisation. In the US isn&#x27;t it even a constitutionally protected right to do so? There&#x27;s a huge difference between &quot;argue against&quot; and &quot;actively try to sabotage&quot;.<p>Here (Italy) unionization is a constitutionally protected right. My employer can try to persuade me not to join one, but is absolutely not allowed to retaliate against me if I do, discriminate basing on union membership, etc. &gt; My employer can try to persuade me not to join one<p>Yes, and isn&#x27;t this therefore an example of &#x27;tactics that are ok for a company to combat unions&#x27;? They could do whatever they&#x27;re doing with their tech workers. Around these parts any talk of unionizing developers is usually meet with skepticism or derision. So whatever big tech is doing is keeping most of their tech workers happy and unwilling to unionize.<p>They could do the same for their warehouse employees, but that would mean paying them very well and giving good benefits. Paying them like cost co does its store workers  might help It&#x27;s not really feasible to pay their box packers $120k &#x2F; year. Why would they have to?  Tech workers at FAANG are on average paid probably in the 2x-3x range of average in their industry.<p>I suspect if amazon paid 2x average box packer wages and gave good breaks&#x2F;benefits, unions wouldn&#x27;t have much traction there, either.<p>The parallel isn&#x27;t crazy (the economics might be, I haven&#x27;t analyzed) Nobody is asking that warehouse workers or store clerks be paid ridiculous amounts like $120k&#x2F;yr, a fair liveable wage will do, failing that a lot of the problems would be resolved if such companies scaled back whatever policies they have that lead to news stories like Amazon workers peeing in bottles because they can&#x27;t take toilet breaks, but as neither of these things happen you get exploited workers who naturally want to unionise.<p>It&#x27;s also not that feasible to pay developers $120k&#x2F;yr as the rest of the world has found out, America manages it for a number of reasons and because of this you likely won&#x27;t see developers unionise any time soon even if you guys do have some very questionable contracts. But it could be feasible to pay them more than a poverty wage. Something where working full-time would reasonably cover housing and food costs (and ideally healthcare as well) without needing government assistance. That&#x27;s not really my point. My point is that workers wanting to unionize is not some inevitability that Amazon must be forced to deal with. If their workers are happy they may not want to unionize. I think it&#x27;s telling that white collar tech workers generally are against unionizing while Amazon&#x27;s blue collar workers are trying to. So you have workers in the same company, some who feel that it is unnecessary to unionize and some who feel it is. Think about what you&#x27;re asking. Replace the word union with &quot;employees talking to each other and negotiating their contracts&quot;. &gt; work with any union that forms<p>Yes, because why the fuck would you side with the party that has power (the employer) over the side that usually doesn&#x27;t (the employee)? Carrots rather than sticks Do the things that don&#x27;t make employees want to form a union...such as paying and not overworking them. &gt; What tactics are ok for a company to use to combat unions if it doesn&#x27;t want them?<p>Won&#x27;t somebody please think of the companies? :&#x27;( I have not seen any convincing evidence that Amazon’s warehouses have “terrible working conditions”, do you have a source that might change my opinion? The Center for Investigative Reporting has, through its online publication Reveal, covered Amazon for quite some time - especially with respect to injuries.

Good thing those unions are there to help the worker and not just some parasitic middleman who sees an opportunity. &gt;  the people who are forced to work in Amazon&#x27;s warehouses with terrible working conditions don&#x27;t have that luxury.<p>Who is forced to work in Amazon&#x27;s warehouses? Is Amazon rounding up people with guns everyday to make them work there? You live in a small town with small businesses that are undercut by Amazon&#x27;s price and scale. Those businesses slowly die out as everyone in your region switches to ordering online (primarily from Amazon). Amazon opens a warehouse in the region to meet the demand and is now the largest employer around.<p>This exact transformation already happened with Wal-Mart in the 80s and 90s. Obviously no one is literally forcing workers to go to Amazon&#x27;s warehouses but you can see how in essence this leaves them with no choice (i.e. forced). I stopped shopping at Wal-Mart around 2009 and haven&#x27;t bought anything of Amazon&#x27;s website since 2016 (I still bought Whole Foods and Woot for a bit, but I&#x27;ve cut those out too).<p>Newegg is a better place for parts, why use the Amazon stores for B&amp;H and Adorama when you can .. just go to the websites for B&amp;H and Adorama?!<p>I wrote this a while back. Amazon&#x27;s has turned into a platform that&#x27;s basically killed all the other parts sites and competition we use to have:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;the-death-of-the-mom-and-pop-e-store&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;the-death-of-the-mom-and-pop-...</a> Do you have any evidence that Amazon has decreased overall employment? To me it is totally plausible that with the convenience of online shopping they have increased the overall “retail pie” and have not taken away from local businesses. So I would prefer when you make claims about how small business are dying out because of Amazon you provide evidence I should have prefixed that this is drawing heavily on what I remember reading about Walmart and their effect on rural&#x2F;suburban economies when they expanded. In that sense it is conjecture on my part as I&#x27;m not drawing on any studies about Amazon in particular. I only wanted to show how large corporations that compete directly with small retail employers can get an unfair advantage against their labour force.<p>Your theory could obviously be valid as well. My life was transformed with the growth of WalMart and Amazon.<p>The quality, variety, convenience and price of goods available to me all improved.  The Mom and Pop who had been financing their lifestyle on the backs of the rural poor were forced out of business.  I feel a little bad for them, but it seems wrong to elevate them over the rest of the population. I don&#x27;t think anyone here will disagree with you. They&#x27;re just saying that this new system brings its own problems. Namely heightened labor monopsony. That doesn&#x27;t mean we have to go back to mom and pop systems, but it probably does mean we should work on solving the new problems. As Colin says, I don&#x27;t disagree. I don&#x27;t think twice about ordering an item on Amazon for $2 that a hardware store downstairs sells for $5. I understand why the store&#x27;s margins need to be that high but I also need to make sound financial decisions and don&#x27;t make enough to subsidize anyone else. At the end of the day I&#x27;m still contributing to Amazon&#x27;s growth at the expense of a more fragmented market of small businesses. Most of the world&#x27;s natural resources and land have already been claimed. This means that most people have no choice but to work for the people who control those resources and land. Not only that, land that once belonged to the people was privatized during the Industrial Revolution in order to create a landless class of people that needed to work in the new factories in order to eat. It was hard to convince people to work in them otherwise. Land belonging to the people is a horrible system that creates huge inefficiencies due to moral hazard. If you look at the agricultural revolution in Europe, a major reason for increased crop yields was private property. Incentives matter. You point to efficiency, but to achieve that efficiency, people were driven off of land that their families had lived on for millennia in order to create a class of people that were desperate enough to risk their lives and limbs, and their children&#x27;s lives and limbs, in dangerous factories for wages they couldn&#x27;t sustain themselves with.<p>Millions of people went from self-sufficiency to being desperately poor and without homes because their land was privatized by governments that were in cahoots with industrialists. I don&#x27;t think that makes it just that people have no opportunity to work for themselves or be payed a fair wage working for someone else. Please. It&#x27;s the only option available to a lot of people anymore especially with COVID shutdowns but it&#x27;s part of a larger shift to a knowledge-economy. There aren&#x27;t many jobs for unskilled workers anymore and getting skills is too expensive for the poor. Ignoring that reality is ridiculous and only proves you don&#x27;t argue in good faith. Getting the credentials is too expensive.  Skills are nearly  free.  Most industries run on credentials.  It&#x27;s an important distinction. They&#x27;ll get there, be patient. Can I just point out that I think the &quot;horrible working conditions&quot; things is a little played up.<p>You want to know terrible working conditions dancing with a sign for 5 hours a day in the sun when it&#x27;s 90+. I did that for 3 years and was happy to do the job, mind you this was only 10 years ago so it isn&#x27;t forever. I made 7.50 an hour. I would&#x27;ve killed to get a job at amazon back then.<p>People are getting payed $16 that is incredible for an unskilled labor position. &gt; People are getting payed $16 that is incredible for an unskilled labor position.<p>That&#x27;s one view, but it&#x27;s only informed by &quot;the way things are&quot;. Another view is based on the way things should be, that no one should have to work for less than the wage it takes to live a reasonable life. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingwage.mit.edu&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingwage.mit.edu&#x2F;</a> offers values for this.<p>I don&#x27;t see why someone should work full time and still end up poor. &gt;I don&#x27;t see why someone should work full time and still end up poor.<p>no offense, but this assumes too much about a person. you could make minimum wage $100 an hour, and there will still be poor people because some people make bad decisions. (not even taking into account that that would cause massive inflation etc). just giving a person $100 an hour doesn&#x27;t guarantee they won&#x27;t end up poor, as evidence by all the professional athletes that made millions and ended up bankrupt<p>another note, your link above gives massively different outcomes based on life situations (1 adult, 2 adult, 0-3+ kids etc). Do we need to make minimum wage such that it works for 1 adult with 5 kids who somehow got there with no skills whatsoever such that they are still working for minimum wage? Some people make poor choices in life, and we can&#x27;t just raise minimum wage to a point that makes up for that. It&#x27;s simply not possible.<p>Now, we can talk about other safety nets, such as a universal basic income, and universal healthcare, etc which I&#x27;m 100% for. The gov&#x27;t should help these people, they shouldn&#x27;t force small businesses to pay people more than the value they bring to the business. This is just picking winners, amazon will get bigger, and small businesses will get killed. Let the free market decide how much people are worth in the market to a business, and let gov&#x27;t help keep people out of poverty. If a business can’t afford to pay its workers a living wage it can’t afford to exist.<p>Why should the government have to bail out business that can’t afford to operate? they can afford to operate. workers have agreed to do the job for the price set today. you want to raise that number arbitrarily, which they can&#x27;t afford. This thread is very specifically about how Amazon workers have agreed to do the job for a certain price, and how Amazon is trying to stop that process from proceeding. Even by your own perception of the situation, Amazon is in the wrong. People being able to feed and house themselves and their children is arbitrary?<p>That “agreement” to work for the current price is compelled by the threat of hunger and homelessness. It is not a fair and free agreement when one party has all of the power.<p>The very very very very least a company could do is pay all of their workers a living wage. 32K a year is poor?<p>World average is 18K, that&#x27;s adjusted for purchasing power parity. 32K is at least 2nd quintile, maybe top. Poland is a little less than 32K average, Japan is around 38K, OECD data from 2019. Somewhere between Japan and Poland is where the average worker starts to be poor. Interesting.<p>And that is at the present time, every generation going back to the invention of agriculture had it worse. Someone making 32K a year - PPP adjusted - is in what, the top few percent of all humans that have ever lived? Poor bastard. Learn to code.<p>In the same way that if everything is about politics, nothing is about politics, if everyone is poor, no one is poor. And if these people aren&#x27;t making a living wage while making what the top few percent of humans have ever made, how did our ancestors manage to live and have children on a sub-living wage? Shouldn&#x27;t they have died out?<p>I think in this case, &quot;living wage&quot; is just a propaganda term. &quot;Poor&quot; is too I guess. I guess maybe that propaganda term works on people, &quot;living wage&quot;. It seems to be effective propaganda, seems to be working. I just cringe every time I read it. Adjusted for inflation, I made $7 an hour working in a factory. Decades later you&#x27;re going to tell me that isn&#x27;t a living wage, more than twice what I made back then wasn&#x27;t a living wage? Was I lucky to survive?<p>That&#x27;s bullshit by the technical definition of bullshit, and its propaganda.<p>Anyway, these arguments usually split people into two camps, people who worked warehouse or factory jobs before, and people who haven&#x27;t. &gt; I don&#x27;t see why someone should work full time and still end up poor.<p>Then focus on the right problem which is cost of living.<p>Focusing on salary doesn&#x27;t fix the problem when you have markets that are heavily housing constrained and massive government meddling in education and healthcare that drive up the cost of both well in excess of inflation.<p>Increasing wages without addressing housing shortages, just puts more money in the pockets of landlords as those higher wages drive up rents.<p>Whether someone gets $1 or $2 matters not if you can buy the same amount of stuff with it.<p>In the overwhelming majority places in the country $16&#x2F;hour is decent amount that goes a long way. That&#x27;s over $40k at 50 hours a week. That&#x27;s enough to live on your own in most places. If you have roommates, it goes even further.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the $16. It&#x27;s the circumstances in very very few geographic markets where $16&#x2F;hour isn&#x27;t enough because cost of living is out of control in those few markets. And I disagree that everyone should get paid a loving wage.<p>Let&#x27;s take 2 identical twins Juan and Jamal (because if you&#x27;ve seen Juan you&#x27;ve seen Jamal). In school Jamal works hard, studies, and puts his efforts first. Juan on the other hand decides football is the way to go and along with that partying, drinking and at one point gets a gal pregnant.<p>They graduate Jamal gets several scholarships and goes to school while working part time to try and avoid debt. Juan only qualifies for community college but spends several years &quot;finding himself&quot; aka partying, drinking and generally not doing much.<p>4 years later Jamal graduates from school and gets a successful software engineering gig making a decent salary with which he is able to afford a decent house for him, his wife and his 2 children.<p>Meanwhile Juan has just finished his latest stint in jail for another DUI and it is a wake up call to him. He decides to get his life in order so he cuts out the drugs and the bad friends and tries to find a job. Unfortunately he&#x27;s unqualified for anything decent because it turns out shotgunning a beer is a useless skill.<p>For many years Juan has made poor decisions, he has been a drain on society and it&#x27;s resources, but now wants to change. That is good however to claim that he should get the same privileges and standing as his brother who spent years working hard giving back and making better long term choices is asinine.<p>EDIT:<p>There have been a lot of great and informative comments. Several people have been calling this out as a strawman. I&#x27;d like to point out this isn&#x27;t a strawman this is actually remarkably close to what happenned in my own family, it isn&#x27;t a fantastic out of this world scenario, it&#x27;s one I lived. Dismissing this as a strawman, is to dismiss hte point without engaging with it. If you need to spend several paragraphs designing a pair of strawmen to illustrate your point, consider widening your view on this.<p>&gt; <i>That is good however to claim that he should get the same privileges and standing as his brother who spent years working hard giving back and making better long term choices is asinine.</i><p>Nobody is complaining that minimum wage isn&#x27;t the same as a software engineering salary. Just that the floor is too low.<p>Unless you think all minimum wage earners are ne&#x27;er-do-well convicts with multiple DUIs? the counter point is that minimum wage is artificial. if you aren&#x27;t actually providing that much value, businesses will just cut the job altogether. if you are trying to raise a large family on minimum wage, well then that&#x27;s obviously a big problem, but it&#x27;s highly likely to be a problem you created with your life choices.<p>on the other hand, if you are in high school or college, minimum wage is likely fine as it&#x27;s just extra spending money. raising minimum wage significantly more than likely just kills these jobs in favor of a kiosk that can do the job just as well.<p>if we want to make it so that everyone can live, that is a job for gov&#x27;t with things like universal healthcare, universal basic income, social safety nets. forcing businesses to pay people more for a job than the job creates in value is not a solution. in the long term those jobs will just go away completely to a technology solution.<p>give people a safety net so that they can not be in poverty, but don&#x27;t force businesses to pay more than the market says a job is worth. kind of a silly argument on a post about amazon anyways, since they pay well above minimum wage, and in fact have campaigned on raising it (not out of the goodness of their hearts mind you, they want to put small competitors out of business and they know they can&#x27;t afford a large min wage hike like amazon can) &gt; <i>if you are trying to raise a large family on minimum wage, well then that&#x27;s obviously a big problem, but it&#x27;s highly likely to be a problem you created with your life choices.</i><p>This is true, but becoming less and less true. Today there are all sorts of jobs that used to provide a living wage, that don&#x27;t anymore. With no college and limited training, you could hire on at an assembly plant and make enough to support yourself. These types of jobs are getting scarcer and scarcer.<p>It&#x27;s not always bad life choices. Sometimes it&#x27;s choices life has made <i>for you</i>. Meaning: you were born in the wrong ZIP code, with the wrong parent(s), and sent to the wrong school. Choices other people made for you, rather than decisions you took the wrong path on.<p>&gt; <i>on the other hand, if you are in high school or college, minimum wage is likely fine as it&#x27;s just extra spending money. raising minimum wage significantly more than likely just kills these jobs in favor of a kiosk that can do the job just as well.</i><p>This is a really hard aspect to design for. I agree that we can&#x27;t require that all jobs pay enough to support a single earner&#x27;s ability to rent an apartment, feed themselves, pay for a car, auto insurance, healthcare, etc. If that were the case, I would never have found work in my teens and early 20s.<p>&gt; <i>if we want to make it so that everyone can live, that is a job for gov&#x27;t with things like universal healthcare, universal basic income, social safety nets. forcing businesses to pay people more for a job than the job creates in value is not a solution. in the long term those jobs will just go away completely to a technology solution.</i><p>I could not agree more.

Employers would offer what the job is worth, and workers would work for what they value their own time at.<p>yup. absolutely. Your post is the very incarnation of the term &quot;strawman&quot;. Less of this, please<p>(although I have to say that I found that part: <i>&quot;but spends several years &quot;finding himself&quot; aka partying, drinking and generally not doing much&quot;</i> kinda funny...) Nobody is saying that Jamal should not be paid more, they&#x27;re just saying the floor should be enough to live. What does that even mean? Live entirely alone in a 1 bedroom apartment? A studio? Live with roommates? What do their meals look like?<p>A &quot;living wage&quot; means absolutely nothing unless you define the expectations.<p>When I first moved to San Francisco in 2011, I was living on less than $300&#x2F;month or so for 8 months or so. I slept on an air mattress and ate rice and beans prepared weekly from 25lb bags because it was cheaper that way. I spent less than a dollar a meal.<p>What expectations do we have that people learn to be frugal? Here&#x27;s someone who lives in the SF Bay Area for $7000&#x2F;year:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earlyretirementextreme.com&#x2F;how-i-live-on-7000-per-year.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earlyretirementextreme.com&#x2F;how-i-live-on-7000-per-ye...</a><p>It&#x27;s actually not hard to live on these wages if you&#x27;re smart about how you spend your money. The only cost you can&#x27;t really escape without moving is the cost of housing, and if you don&#x27;t fix that problem, any increase in wages it just going to be temporary relief until housing prices correct. A &quot;living wage&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;middle class&quot;. A living wage means that a person is able to afford someplace relatively clean to live, feed themselves, afford heat in winter, etc. &gt; A &quot;living wage&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;middle class&quot;. A living wage means that a person is able to afford someplace relatively clean to live, feed themselves, afford heat in winter, etc.<p>That&#x27;s not middle class in traditional class terms (<i>petit bourgeois</i>) based on the manner of interaction with the capitalist economy, but it&#x27;s pretty much requires being “middle class” by the modern American broad income categories standards, where middle class is the middle income category. Are you seriously arguing that whatever fraction of Americans are below &quot;middle income category&quot; should should be ok with not being able to house, feed, cloth, heat themselves - and somehow this would work out ok for the country as a whole?<p>That seems extreme. &gt; Are you seriously arguing that whatever fraction of Americans are below &quot;middle income category&quot; should should be ok with not being able to house, feed, cloth, heat themselves<p>No, I&#x27;m saying that people who are below the middle income category (as that adjusts locally) often <i>cannot</i> reliably, securely &quot;afford someplace relatively clean to live, feed themselves, afford heat in winter, etc.&quot;. I&#x27;m not saying that they should <i>accept</i> that, just that if you are advocating for a living wage, you are, in fact, advocating to move the floor up to something that fits what is commonly styled &quot;middle class&quot; income currently. Ok, I misread you.  I&#x27;m not confident your assertion is true, but I don&#x27;t know enough about the &quot;living wage&quot; analysis to be sure.<p>I guess one factor here is &quot;middle income range&quot;, if well defined, will move if the floor is moved.  In things like this, distribution is also very important. There&#x27;s a world of difference between saying that Juan shouldn&#x27;t have the same privileges and standing as Jamal, and saying that Juan shouldn&#x27;t get a living wage. Do you have any statistics that can tell us how many &quot;Jamals&quot; actually exist in the US labour force? Because it feels like you are exaggerating a tiny tiny minority. I worked in a factory building car bumpers. The work was so alienating that one day I &quot;woke up&quot; in the factory with literally no recollection of the last 2 hours. From all I knew I could have been taken by ETs but since my bumper quota was good I guess I just zoned out and became a bot.<p>And I still call Amazon &quot;horrible working conditions&quot;.<p>The fact that it is better than being poor isn&#x27;t saying much. $16 per hour, at 2000 hours a year, is $32,000. The poverty line in the United States is around $26,000. &quot;Slightly above poverty wages&quot; is still pretty dang poor.<p>(And to forestall the inevitable adjustment of one&#x27;s pince-nez to well-actually: that it&#x27;d be median or even above-median wages <i>somewhere else</i> does not mean that it is not poor <i>in America</i>, nor that the two situations can be reasonably compared.) The purpose of the poverty line isn’t to demarcate who is poor and who is not.<p>It’s purpose is to establish a level at which poverty is 100% ensured.<p>Being below the poverty line means you are certainly poor. Being slightly above the poverty line means you are very probably poor. My first job in IT was back in 2005 and I was only making $25k&#x2F;yr ($30k by the end). That did grow to the point where I can make six figures now though. But it took a lot of experience building.<p>What tracks are available for Amazon warehouse workers who want to move up? I’ve been living in my car in SF for about 915 days, on less than $18k&#x2F;yr take home. I’m so poor that I can barely get hired to a minimum wage job (“but you have a car,” “but you have an iPhone”). Everything I have is left over from a time when I made $200k&#x2F;yr as a software engineer, and thankfully I’ve been given a lot of benefit of the doubt given my upstanding ways. (I was slandered, so people I meet see a good guy but when I interview they’re told of a violent bigot during the reference check, false).<p>I’m working on a book, or books, on the subject. It seems surprising to people that something happens called poverty with less than a certain level of income, that makes things get extremely hard and require great care to recover from. I was on track to get off the street and nearly did last year but faced a setback, and the pandemic threw a big wrench in my system this year (which is adapting, harder mode). My working budget has been $55&#x2F;day or $375&#x2F;wk or $18k&#x2F;yr. I went to your blog and listened to your post on &quot;Interviewing Without Resources&quot; and it feels like a non sequitur.<p>It felt like you see yourself as a victim. I&#x27;ve been out of work before, but I never saw myself as a victim or powerless. I knew what I was worth and yes, it does take a lot of work, but I found work based on my own skills and merits.<p>America is increasingly growing into a nation where we cloth ourselves in victimhood as virtue. We are literally in a space where no-body is in the office today. You could pick up a $130 ~ $160k job anywhere and move out to a suburb in Texas. All you need is half-decent Internet, and you&#x27;d basically be living as if you were making the $200k you had in The Valley.<p>Stand up for yourself. If you only see yourself as a victim, that is all you will ever be. &gt; <i>America is increasingly growing into a nation where we cloth ourselves in victimhood as virtue.

You&#x27;ve been slandered by whom? &quot;You are unreasonable for calling out a bad thing, since I can conceive of an even worse thing.&quot; It’s not unrelated, when talking about pay and working conditions it’s all relative to the rest of the economy and sits in that context, pointing out other parts of that context is perfectly relevant (though it obviously can’t paint a complete picture).<p>We should of course be mindful of whataboutism when discussing these things but I think it’s a good idea to consider the economic and social context when talking about these issues, they don’t exist in a vacuum. The discussion is about Amazon hiring Pinkerton operatives to spy on employees suspected of organizing even when they are off work. This was an interview with the journalist who broke the story as a continuation. [1]<p>Deflecting criticism with &quot;some workers have even more upsetting conditions than these&quot; doesn&#x27;t help either party, moreover it actually shuts down an important discussion relevant to both. We shouldn&#x27;t tolerate any business crushing dissent the way Amazon does; that&#x27;s what is being discussed here.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports...</a> I&#x27;m not talking about deflecting the conversation or shutting down discussions, nor am I even taking a side here (personally I don&#x27;t have enough information about this topic to have an opinion). I just don&#x27;t agree with pretending like the relationship between employers and employees exists in an isolated cultural&#x2F;economic bubble. There are many ways it can inform what actions we should take--at the very least it lets us know if this is a systemic problem or an isolated one, which alone could dramatically change what course of action to take. My point is that if we are interested in helping people in geniuly terrible working conditions there are plenty of people who have it far worse than those at Amazon and those should be the focus of these efforts and outrage rather than people making $16 an hour in moderately decent conditions. People can care about multiple issues at the same time.<p>This discussion isn&#x27;t explicitly about the working conditions of Amazon, it is about the highly unethical methods they use to crush dissent and workers organizing, namely the leaked documents that detail actions including the spying on workers suspected of organizing even outside of work by the Pinkertons.<p>This isn&#x27;t the 19th century, this deeply upsetting and unconscionable behavior should not be tolerated in the 21st century. How about we let those Amazon workers help themselves and form a union? It is incredibly played up.<p>10 years ago, warehouse conditions were the same or worse as they are now except you would be lucky to get $16&#x2F;hr without a forklift operator certification or some other credential that made it more than just &#x27;unskilled labor&#x27; And ~160 years ago we had literal slavery, doesn&#x27;t mean that people&#x27;s working conditions currently are good, just because others were bad or even are still currently bad &gt; You want to know terrible working conditions dancing with a sign for 5 hours a day in the sun when it&#x27;s 90+.<p>While dancing with a sign in the sun does lead to heat exhaustion risks, it&#x27;s unlikely to lead to permanent disability, which seems like the inevitable outcome of working at an Amazon warehouse for too long. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wweek.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;workers-risking-the-covid-19-outbreak-at-amazons-troutdale-warehouse-signed-a-strict-confidentiality-agreement&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wweek.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;workers-riski...</a><p>&gt; On June 10, the Oregon Health Authority announced a COVID-19 outbreak at Amazon&#x27;s Troutdale warehouse that has now lasted 25 weeks and infected 97 people with the virus, making it one of the largest workplace outbreaks in Oregon. It’s a very minor point but this article makes it sound like the generic term for a union buster is Pinkerton agent. Pinkerton is a private company who does security work these days, but has a long history of doing exactly this. Fascinating Wikipedia read if you’re curious.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pinkerton_(detective_agency)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pinkerton_(detective_agency)</a> Another echo from those old days: this news about Amazon was broken by a writer named Lauren Gurley.<p>Elizabeth Gurley Flynn was a famous union organizer who fought the Pinkertons more than a hundred years ago.<p>Coincidentally, the new novel <i>The Cold Millions</i> by Jess Walter portrays Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and the Pinkertons in Spokane in 1909.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elizabeth_Gurley_Flynn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elizabeth_Gurley_Flynn</a><p>(A quick search shows Lauren Gurley is a prolific writer on labor issues but doesn&#x27;t mention any connection to the earlier Gurley - the names might be just a coincidence) Are you reading the book? Do you like it? Yes, I am about midway through right now and I do like it.<p>Imagine my reaction this morning when I saw that the top story on HN was about Pinkerton union busting - reported by a writer named Gurley! Indeed, everything old is new again.  You know the saying, right?  History doesn&#x27;t repeat, but it sure does rhyme.  This is often attributed to Mark Twain, but there&#x27;s no real evidence he actually said it. Given how we seem to be unwilling to learn from history, I prefer Julian Barnes&#x27; take from &quot;A History of the World in 10½ Chapters&quot;<p>&gt; History just burps, and we taste again that raw-onion sandwich it swallowed centuries ago. In this case, I think quoting the introduction to the The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte by Marx is more apt: Hegel says somewhere that great historic facts and personages recur twice. He forgot to add: &quot;Once as tragedy, and again as farce.&quot; &quot;Pinkerton operatives were inserted into an Amazon warehouse in Wroclaw, Poland, to investigate an allegation that warehouse workers were circumventing sort of the application process for applying to warehouse jobs&quot;<p>How does this match the title of the piece. Then,<p>&quot;So I imagine that in the U.S., they&#x27;re tracking labor organizing activity but not union members yet.&quot;<p>So they have no proof and this is all speculation. Another Amazon hit piece, real quality journalism here.<p>Amazon used some people to catch people cheesing their job application process and then because the US doesn&#x27;t have strong unions and they know they look at labor stats for people joining Unions this &quot;journalist&quot; has extrapolated they are definitely &quot;surveiling&quot; people. This is really low quality.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m fine with the allegations being true, the point I&#x27;m making is this isn&#x27;t the article that we should be discussing because it&#x27;s lazy journalism -- another poster below me linked much more well thought out and written posts on the subject being discussed by this article. Leaked documents from Amazon’s Global Security Operations Center reveal the company’s reliance on Pinkerton operatives to spy on warehouse workers and the extensive monitoring of labor unions, environmental activists, and other social movements. [1]<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;speculation&quot; or &quot;poor journalism&quot;, it is an assessment that exists within the context of a company that has been aggressively anti-union for years, for which employees are trained to rat out union organizers,[2] and, of course, in light of their retention of Pinkertons to infiltrate employee Facebook groups dedicated to organizing.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-revealed-in-leake-1829305201\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-re...</a> Fine but you had to use alternative sources to get that information.<p>This particular piece is trash because it didn&#x27;t go get those leaked documents and then discuss them in depth like the vice link. That is real investigative journalism. This linked piece speculated the entire way through.<p>This should be dropped from the front page and we should be discussing the vice or gizmodo article which actually put in the work to go through the allegations. The linked article is an interview with the journalist who leaked the documents discussed in the Vice and Gizmodo articles. I think this story is intended to be a continuation of the discussion on the original story. Okay that is not particularly clear to me from the article and it&#x27;s doing a disservice to the overall discussion then, imo. They should at least be linking to the original articles then to give context on that fact. You may be right about that.<p>The reason I went looking for the Vice article in the first place was due to what was said in the first paragraph of the article:<p>&gt;According to documents, Amazon reportedly runs a surveillance program to track activism among its workers. NPR&#x27;s Ari Shapiro talks with Lauren Gurley of Motherboard magazine, who broke the story. I&#x27;ll fully admit I gloss right over the names of journalists typically in favor of reading the content of the article, though had I read that I still would have had to search for the story much like you did. I can take two things away here, I should slow down when reading an article and this article should still be more obvious about the work they&#x27;re discussing. Amazon had all kinds of issues in Poland. They were paying so badly at the beginning that many people who applied for the job were former convicts. Some of them took advantage of the opportunity and start steeling stuff from packages (inventing ingenious methods of smuggling them outside in the process). This was a plague at some point.<p>Eventually thiefs were caught and fired. But then they applied for the job again through agency and came back (Agency was an employer, not Amazon, so, probably Amazon did not have enough data to check who i who).<p>The fact that Amazon needs to employ top notch investigators is in itself rather hilarious. Those super agents are chasing people who earn about $610 a month (minus taxes). Sure I don&#x27;t really care about that though, I care that this piece is a really bad representation of journalism and the fact that it&#x27;s on the front page instead of better researched and fielded pieces two of which have been linked in a sub comment here from another poster are not. &gt; How does this match the title of the piece.<p>Read again:<p>&gt; &gt;  It involves collecting data, it seems, from Facebook groups, from social media. In some cases in the case of the Pinkertons, there is a line in one of the documents that we&#x27;ve obtained that says that Pinkerton operatives were inserted into a warehouse in Wroclaw, Poland, to gather intelligence on what their warehouse workers were up to.<p>The Pinkerton case seems to be one case out of several mentioned in the papers and while the stated reason is to sniff out the application process even that is in direct conflict with official statements by Amazon.<p>&gt; So they have no proof and this is all speculation.<p>They list a few points they know about right before the line you quoted.<p>&gt; Another Amazon hit piece, real quality journalism here.<p>Still a lot better than the copy pasted Amazon press releases after it lost the lawsuit in France. Those were pure fiction with Bezos in the role of the poor abused Emperor Palpatine. &quot;Pinkerton: for over one-hundred years, the ones to call when you&#x27;ve got a union problem.&quot;<p>I mean, that <i>has</i> to be their schtick, right, even if it&#x27;s unspoken? Because that pretty much sums up what I know about Pinkerton, so I would assume they are happy with that.<p>As for the topic at hand, yeah well, that&#x27;s what companies do...for over one-hundred years as well. Somebody should try to unionize Pinkerton employees. seems like police unions would be more fitting if my memory of history serves me right To the point where if someone ever introduces themselves to me as a Pinkerton employee, my first instinct would be to assume they&#x27;re immoral and not someone I want to know.<p>It&#x27;s a company with a history of supporting exploitation wherever it&#x27;s gone. how many Pinkerton employeee have you met? Also, you know what they say about assumptions.. By extension, anyone you meet who works at Amazon should be considered that as well. Google and Facebook too probably. Walmart? Honestly any corporation. Add anyone working for the government in there as well I don&#x27;t think that is fair. Pinkerton has a history of actual violence and in directly enabling the very worst tendencies of some of the very worst abusive labour practices. In terms of participating in oppression, the proportion of Pinkerton employees directly involved in making lives worse for employees is much higher than most other companies and at least most democratic governments. I honestly thought &quot;Pinkerton agents&quot; was a metaphor. :) Like the way you say &quot;xerox that paper&quot;. Dito. But it&#x27;s really far worse that Amazon is able to use literal Pinkerton agents, because it implies the organisation hasn&#x27;t been torn to shreds as you expect it should have been. Ah, lovely of Amazon to employ the EXACT same people that Carnegie and Frick hired to beat and kill steel workers in 1892. How long before Amazon has the Pinkertons open fire on the unionizers?<p>Great prescident, Amazon. No bad choices here. Just the honest, fair dealings of the richest man in the world hiring the same people who&#x27;ve been murdering strikers and unionizers since 1850. Stay classy Jeff! The exact same people? I marvel at their longevity! 128+ years is quite an accomplishment!  Please don&#x27;t post unsubstantive comments here.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> the point of the comment is that this characterization is absurd and also you&#x27;re a jerk you know that right Corporations are people, legally. Common nonsense and entirely false.<p>Corporations are treated like people for certain elements of the legal process (like the question of civil rights) because they are owned and operated by people, as a way for those people to do things together as a group (like exercising civil rights).<p>This line is a strong indicator that you&#x27;re with or have been influenced by the &quot;I hate Citizens United&quot; people, who never seem to bother to remember that Citizens United itself was incorporated as a nonprofit, making a movie about Hillary Clinton with (non-tax-deductible) donations, as an exercise in those peoples&#x27; first amendment rights — one which the FEC sought to stop.<p>Anyway, Pinkerton&#x27;s corporation has been replaced by a successor legal entity wholly owned by Securitas AB. do you have any (not too legal\\dry) background reading on this? I&#x27;m not in the USA, so I might have let my biases lead me in what to believe. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citizens_United_v._FEC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citizens_United_v._FEC</a><p>A judge ruled that a corporation was a person for the purposes of granting first amendment rights to run advertisements endorsing or attacking political candidates. The Koch Brothers could then spend an unlimited amount of money attacking any candidates who proposed environmental regulations, for instance.<p>It essentially shifted the power in America towards whomever had the bigger megaphone and more campaign financing. I meant the other view, the one the person I replied to was hinting at. The one that doesn&#x27;t make it seen like a horrible thing for society. I don&#x27;t have a ton of &quot;legal&quot; analysis but if you&#x27;d like partisan analysis of Citizens United I recommend the Libertarians — <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;citizens-united&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;citizens-united&#x2F;</a><p>(you will of course notice the usual partisan ramblings you&#x27;d expect from an overtly Libertarian outlet, but, well, they&#x27;re the ones with interest and motivation to cover it).<p>But the amazing thing is that you can&#x27;t say &quot;look at this small nonprofit the FEC was trying to shut up&quot; or even a talk that acknowledges the conflicts between what seems fair and enumerated rights. No, no, instead we must bring nonsense memes with negative information: &quot;corporations and people are the same and Koch money has ended our democracy forever&quot;. People and corporations are both regarded as entities. That doesn&#x27;t mean one is another.<p>An apple isn&#x27;t a pear, even though both are fruits. Only partially, since corporations can be owned by people and other corporations, yet owning people is not legal. If corporations were people, we&#x27;d see some face the death penalty. And the people running those organizations change, biologically. no, not really Don&#x27;t be obtuse. Interfering with unionization needs to be illegal, and not met with fines that affect only the bottom line of a balance sheet, but jail time for everyone involved, with mandatory minimum sentencing. If this is true Bezos should be behind bars. How many corporate execs have actually gone to prison for wrongdoings done in the name of the corporation?  There&#x27;s Ken Lay from Enron, one completely random banker from the financial crisis of 2008, and not a whole lot of others I can think of. Kenneth Lay died on holiday at a resort before he was sentenced.  The conviction was vacated:<p><i>Lay, who at age 64 succumbed to a massive heart attack at a rented Colorado vacation home, was found guilty by a federal jury in May along with former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling of conspiracy and fraud. The two were star defendants in the notorious business scandal, which vaporized more than 4,000 jobs and billions of dollars in stockholders’ investments.</i><p><i>But when a defendant who pleaded not guilty dies before sentencing, as Lay did, in most cases the conviction is wiped out on the grounds that the defendant did not have the opportunity to appeal, legal experts said....</i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2006-jul-06-fi-lay6-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2006-jul-06-fi-lay6-...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kenneth_Lay\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kenneth_Lay</a> To me, the lengths Amazon goes to discourage unionization hints at how vulnerable they feel they are to certain aspects of unionization (probably strikes).<p>This isn&#x27;t that much of a surprise though. The more we automate stuff (excluding complete automation), the more important the squishy humans that keep everything running are. At least in Europe, strikes don&#x27;t seem to be the driving factor. They are hit anyway often enough by Verdi in Germany, and there is no way Amazon can prohibit people from signing up with a union. Not being able to enforce working conditions seems to more of a factor to me. Not that Amazon is harsher on warehouse staff than, say, DHL. It is more the monitoring and so on. No idea how things are in the US so. &gt;Amazon hired Pinkerton operatives in Europe to surveil workers.<p>Europeans would be more familiar with the name Securitas as in three red dots security firm.<p>Pinkerton is a subsidiary of Swedish company Securitas AB.  Securitas has over 330,000 employees. Seems more helpful to link to the original article on Motherboard: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dp3yn&#x2F;amazon-leaked-reports...</a><p>Among other things the article differentiates between the internal Amazon org monitoring union-forming activities and the Pinkertons who were tasked with looking into warehouse workers for unrelated reasons which the NPR headline seems to conflate. Pretty disgusting and completely unsurprising. Most of us (sadly) can&#x27;t avoid if our companies use AWS, but a significant fraction can absolutely do without the &quot;convenience&quot; of Amazon, shopping at Whole Foods, etc.<p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to be able-bodied enough that I don&#x27;t need package delivery, so I haven&#x27;t used Amazon in a few years. I don&#x27;t miss it, doubly so when articles like this come out. I&#x27;m a brit, can someone give me an overview of the law on US unions? If one forms, are Amazon compelled to work with them like in European nations? If its still just At Will employment, I don&#x27;t see how a union would make any difference there, Amazon can (will) just fire everyone who joins and replace them tomorrow right? Interfering with a union or the formation of a union are explicitly illegal. This includes firing someone for trying to organize, at-will employment or no. However, this doesn&#x27;t keep employers from trying, or from retaliation using pretextual explanations to avoid penalties. It&#x27;s also common for employers to force employees to watch anti-union propaganda. Much of the overall culture in the US, as well, has turned hostile to unions.<p>State and federal law have been growing increasingly hostile to unions. Since 1910, if a union is formed by way of a majority vote of the employees, then they are required to represent <i>all</i> employees, whether or not they pay dues. Many states, including New York, California, and most &quot;blue&quot; states, allow &quot;union shops&quot;, requiring all employees to pay dues whether or not they choose to join. But many, including most &quot;red&quot; states, have &quot;Right to Work&quot; laws banning union shops and allowing only &quot;open shops&quot;. Any employee can therefore benefit from a union without contributing to it. The immediate free-rider problem cripples labor organization in those states. The problem is compounded by manufacturers moving their production to RtW states to save on labor costs. Boeing, for example, has moved much of its production from Washington, where its employees are unionized, to South Carolina, where they aren&#x27;t. Membership has fallen from 20% in 1984 to 10% in 2018. Moreover, the Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that unionized public sector jobs must <i>all</i> be open shops, overturning a 1977 decision. That covers about half of the country&#x27;s membership, so we can expect it to weaken labor even more in the years to come.<p>The overall result is that the power of organized labor is a pale shadow of what it was in the mid-20th century. Thanks. It doesn&#x27;t seem like an Amazon union would actually have any teeth so long as amazon can either ignore them or fire&#x2F;de-schedule workers that actually take any action (strike, work to rule, go-slow etc). Pinkerton has a long history of criminal activity.<p>It&#x27;s unbelievable that Bezos gets away with this with such minimal media attention.  (Yeah, it&#x27;s on NPR, but I highly doubt I&#x27;ll see it on CNN, at the most, maybe Fox will say something because they view Bezos as a political enemy)<p>My great grandfather was a miner in southern WV during the time period where Pinkerton agents intimidated and harassed the families of union members, and often assaulting them.  Eventually it all culminated in this:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Blair_Mountain\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Blair_Mountain</a><p>It should be noted that Blair Mountain was the only time in history where US warplanes (very primitive at the time) dropped bombs on US soil directed at US citizens. I honestly don&#x27;t know why you got downvoted. Who knows?  There&#x27;s people on here who will not like something you say in one thread, and downvote you on others.  Hopefully not many.  Perhaps my statement was viewed as off-topic?<p>I was downvoted rather aggressively in another thread for calling Trump &quot;his orangeness&quot; which my Trump voter friends and family chuckle at, but apparently is in bad decorum on HN.  In their defense, they are just desperately trying to keep it all from devolving into Reddit territory. History repeats itself. Check out the story of the Molly Maguires, a somewhat vigilante labor group in PA&#x27;s coal region, who were infiltrated by an undercover Pinkerton in the late 1800s: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Molly_Maguires#In_the_United_States\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Molly_Maguires#In_the_United_S...</a> I&#x27;m from the region of PA where this all happened, and it&#x27;s a well-known story among locals. In itself, this may suggest something is really going on here.<p>We&#x27;re seemingly turning from ebb to flow in the union&#x2F;anti-union pendulum. Meanwhile, amazon&#x27;s employees are a genuinely vast group. Quantity is a quality, and amazon knows that scale can change how things work in hard to predict ways.<p>It&#x27;s possible that amazon is ahead of the game. Most of what I&#x27;ve heard&#x2F;read from the pro-union side is fairly generic. Why unions are beneficial generally. I definitely hear more positive sentiments towards unions, but...<p>I haven&#x27;t heard much about goals, tactics, strategies, proposed unionisation structures. I haven&#x27;t heard any ideas relating to novel 2020 realities: amazon&#x27;s size, digital economics, amazon&#x27;s record profits and market cap.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard anything approaching deliverables. Pay rises? Who? How much? Benefits? Amazon have $250k aws engineers, part time whole foods workers? How does this relate to unionisation strategy or goals.<p>Even is the sentiment pendulum is swinging back to pro-union, a big role for unions still seems distant. It could take decades. How does one get a job as a Pinkerton agent? Not that I&#x27;d want one, but I can&#x27;t imagine the job posting&#x2F;how they approach it. Security team? Here&#x27;s one job posting. It seems just like applying for any other job.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.com&#x2F;job-listing&#x2F;agent-pinkerton-JV_IC1134644_KO0,5_KE6,15.htm?jl=3460215793\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.com&#x2F;job-listing&#x2F;agent-pinkerton-JV_IC1...</a> But at amazon they&#x27;re blending them into the work force, is amazon contracting pinkerton or hiring their own? I guess it&#x27;s just an undercover person on their security team? We are letting amazon going way too far. This is unacceptable. A global coalition of trade-unions is mobilizing against amazon, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makeamazonpay.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makeamazonpay.com&#x2F;</a><p>Also legislators should get more aware of companies undermining workers right. But I feel legislators to be part of the problem. unionizing amazon would be horrible, I&#x27;ve been working at usps for 15+ years and unions are the reason for most of our troubles. Please lets not turn a company who makes a good product and pays people well for it into the enemy So why don&#x27;t you go and work for amazon? because i&#x27;m not in the union lol Its safe to assume that as usual Amazon, Pinkerton, the unions and NPR&#x2F;journalists are all being shady for their own self-serving reasons. Also, its appears they are all in bed with each other anyway. Some of them are trying to appear noble for extra credit. In this thread: Far too many people seeing human rights as a dangerous slippery slope. I&#x27;ll try using other online retailers whenever I can until Amazon gets splitted. Another great film on union breaking is the 1976 documentary Harlan County USA<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FCOd7fPHmfU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;FCOd7fPHmfU</a> &quot;Here&#x27;s $15 an hour...take it or leave, no one is forcing you&quot; blah blah. It doesn&#x27;t work that way in modern states. If you cannot afford to feed, shelter and educate your kids, that will fall unto others (Govt) since we&#x27;ve come a long way since Sparta.<p>Also, Amazon is closing stores left and right and turning maybe millions of small businesses into $15 an hour temporary jobs. The government has every right to get involved. Some people in this thread propose a boycott to Amazon by not buying their products. But this effort is mostly null and void since the warehouse division is largely subsidized by AWS which is funded by most of the Fortune 500.<p>These boycotts might piss off an executive or VP within the warehouse division, but Amazon as a whole will continue to exist.<p>Personally, I have stopped using all AWS&#x2F;Amazon.com&#x2F;Prime services but I am only a minnow in this vast sea. If Bezos was really naughty he would <i>fund</i> unionizing at competitors like Walmart, Hy-Vee, Kroger, ... On some level this makes sense. Unions murder margins and productivity so you&#x27;d want to be circumspect. Wait Pinkerton is still around? How have they not rebranded like Blackwater? The employees should hire a detective agency to spy Jeff.<p>Then he&#x2F;they would understand. Man these people always end up on the wrong side of history. Pinkerton the company or the idea of Pinkerton I’m confused. Union busting practices like this should be illegal. What a surprise! Its funny they don&#x27;t care at all about the Indian labor organization which control &gt; 50% of tech jobs at Amazon and are funded by the Indian government and their lobbying organization NASSCOM.  Probably because &gt; 50% of tech managers there are Indian nationals.  In fact they promote Indian labor union formation there, which Amazon calls Bof&#x27;s.  They are absolutely entranced, though, in attempts to extract one more penny from blue collar jobs such warehouse, trucking, and security guards which are predominately staffed by white, black, and latino Americans.<p>Amazon&#x27;s tech labor costs have to be in the tens of billions per year. They are paying SDE&#x27;s, SDM&#x27;s $200k-$1MM and but are surveilling $15 people who are stealing candybars. Junk made in China by impoverished and forced labor + union busting and poor wages in fulfillment = Jeff Bezos and his executives becoming even fatter cats. If it&#x27;s any concession Bezos had his privacy violated by his girlfriend&#x27;s brother and then made a fool of himself by blaming MBS. Private sector unions are fine as long as we let capitalism play out. No bailouts&#x2F;taxes when GM&#x2F;Ford&#x2F;Chrysler can&#x27;t afford to pay the bills.<p>Public sector unions are a danger to society. A monopoly in monopoly will take down the whole country. These transcripts are literal, hard to read with &quot;it seems&quot;, &quot;I mean&quot;, &quot;you know&quot;, &quot;sort of&quot;, &quot;so&quot;. Transcripts should be be cleaned up for print. Then they wouldn&#x27;t be transcripts... Both audio and transcripts are quite routinely cleaned up for broadcast and publication.  Enough so on NPR &#x2F; public radio that it&#x27;s a signature.

They would be editorialized.<p>Original transcripts are powerful in that they are difficult to refute. Why is this problematic? I find the idea of unions distasteful. Why should all employees be obligated to join a union? It would make more sense if it was voluntary and people collectively bargain as a subgroup whose size is smaller than all employees. But forcing a single union upon all employees is just creating a separate parallel management structure, one that often tends towards practices that ultimately deliver less for customers by legitimizing things like tenure-based rules. Having a single union also eliminates competition - I just don&#x27;t see why that is a good thing. And what stops employees from just forming their own company to provide a service that is contracted out? The company can choose whether or not to use their services based on their offer. That sounds good in theory, but essentially gives the company the ability to play groups off each other. The entire point of unionization is to be able to negotiate on level terms.<p>This viewpoint also seems to assume that merit is the most important thing, and that unions <i>should</i> optimize for it. For a union, tenure is super important to maintain its strength. Corporations are held together with contracts and money, so they optimize for things that are legally safe and make more money than they cost. Unions are held together with only social fabric, so it makes sense to optimize for things that maintain continuity and cohesion. I think unions playing off each other is a good thing. Competition is a great mechanism for preventing counterproductive policies like favoring tenure, avoiding accountability, and so forth.<p>There are also other benefits (unrelated to compensation) from having competing unions. To get more concrete about this, consider that the National Education Association (largest union in the US, representing teachers) is very politically biased and recently started pushing the NYT&#x27;s &quot;1619 Project&quot; on educators (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neaedjustice.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;the-1619-project&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neaedjustice.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;the-1619-project&#x2F;</a>). I find this to be unacceptable because it is weaponizing public schooling to achieve political ends, which is indistinguishable from what we label as &quot;propaganda&quot; in other countries (except that it comes from a big monolithic union rather than a government). Not to mention the 1619 project is factually incorrect (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;1619-project-new-york-times-mistake-122248\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;1619-proje...</a>).<p>So if you&#x27;re a student, parent, or educator who disagrees with the NEA&#x27;s push with the 1619 project, what can you do? If you want to keep your job, you&#x27;re obligated to pay the union dues, subsidize their institutional politics, and play along with union rules. Having several competing teacher unions, on the other hand, would allow for those who disagree with this politicization to separate themselves from the NEA while still having access to jobs and having the ability to collectively bargain as their own subset.<p>Put another way, unions as implemented in US law grant local labor monopolies to unions. Fundamentally, this is no different than when a big telecom player like Comcast has a local monopoly. We can see it&#x27;s not healthy in that instance, so why is this any different? It seems like you ignored my original post, which explained exactly why that idea doesn&#x27;t work, and why your continued talk about &quot;inefficiency&quot; and ragging on tenure is ignorant.<p>I&#x27;ll restate. Labor has to be a single unit in order to negotiate on equal terms with capital. Since unions are formed in a given workplace or industry, it&#x27;s not like a union or local can negotiate with multiple employers in order to gain leverage. That concept kind of exists in the form of consulting agencies, but they fill a much different niche. Unions optimize their power structure for continuity and cohesion - the efficiency of their employer is highly, highly secondary. This is a good thing, as stable unions means a stable middle class, and low social unrest. Minimizing the labor cost of American businesses is not the end-all, be-all of social KPI.<p>Based on your comments, I&#x27;m guessing you have a specific political bent, but if you do the slightest bit of research, you&#x27;ll find that people of all persuasions push their ideology via the School Board. Texas is a particularly famous example of right-wing ideologues re-writing history in their way. Unfortunately the humans seem to be the weak point of the system, so the only thing you can do is be involved and build a strong community. And AFAIK in the US specifically, a union can only force an employer to accept them if it gets the majority on board to represent all employees, which means unions representing only some employees, while possible, are heavily disadvantaged, so pushing for covering all employees of a group makes even more sense. Which of your legal rights should your employer be allowed to attempt to suppress if someone doesn&#x27;t like you using them? Amazon is making good money. This annoys a lot of people, thus hit pieces are written. News at 11. No, people aren&#x27;t annoyed at Amazon because they make a lot of money. That is a false and unsubstantiated assertion. Pinkertons were one of the enemies in RDR2! Am I the only one who thought of the video game Red Dead Redemption 2? The levels of corporate greed in the world today are making me give up on humanity. &gt;&quot;... today ...&quot;<p>Are you implying that they were less greedy at some other time? The whole economy is driven by greed. Always was, always will. You can get some exceptions here and there but the general picture is pure greed. It would be interesting if someone had a meaningful measure with which to compare corporate greed of today to the greed of feudalism, the greed of colonial empires, and the like. Well talking about Feudalism, the economy was very different back then.<p>Money wasn&#x27;t yet able to buy you everything, your birth family would matter much more. So feudal lords weren&#x27;t driven by profit (profit didn&#x27;t really exist as a concept as it does today) but by other values like glory, etc. Not to say that they weren&#x27;t greedy, because they were indeed, but they certainly didn&#x27;t think about infinite growth or perpetually finding ways to make shareholders richer, like your corporate lord would today. This is equal parts sad and hilarious if true.  I have a sudden urge to watch Deadwood again. I thought the headline was a mistake and that these were “Pinkerton-style” agents.<p>Nope. They’re legitimately Pinkerton. Surely Amazon must know better than to partner with the most recognized name in anti-labor practices. Their PR guy needs to be sitting in on these meetings. Why would they care? The stories of how Amazon is a bad employer keep coming and yet people keep buying. I mean, they’re the most recognized name because they’re the best at it. Why would you expect anything else? Amazon is a logistics company like UPS; if Bezos didn&#x27;t squeeze every last drop of profit from their employees it wouldn&#x27;t be world-dominating. The world-dominating is largely a negative from my perspective: it pushes it&#x27;s smaller competitors out of business which decreases the competitiveness of the market and extracts profits&#x2F;wealth out of local communities where it would likely be spent productively into the pockets of Jeff Bezos and Amazon investors where it is not nearly so useful. The services they provide have been of incomparable quality to any other offering in the US. They made free 2-day shipping and free returns the baseline. Amazon lockers provide online shopping opportunities to those not privileged to own a house with a secure front yard (I do wish shipping to amazon lockers was possible from other online-only retailers). And in truth the vast majority of amazon’s income is still invested back into the salaries of its workers and building infrastructure — they have notoriously thin profit margins outside of AWS. Bezos’ fabulous wealth comes from stock.<p>Edit: I’m not affiliated with amazon and my acquaintances had very stressful experiences working there. But as a customer I really appreciate their service In Canada it is possible to order online directly to any post office via a special address and pick up there for free.<p>This is IMO a much better solution because post offices are already necessary and present everywhere, and individual retailers don&#x27;t have to support the option to ship to them. <i>&quot;Bezos’ fabulous wealth comes from stock.&quot;</i><p>Stock ownership should be illegal. I agree with every word you say. Jeff Bezos has made 90 billion dollars during the pandemic. He does not need to squeeze every drop of profit. Thing is, he does. Else his wealth would quickly evaporate, and he&#x27;d be like the CEOs of Fedex, UPS &amp; suchlike. The fact that most of his wealth is in stocks doesn&#x27;t help. The CEO of FedEx is a billionaire. How is this &quot;evaporated wealth&quot;? Are you really saying if Amazon workers had safe working conditions and hazard pay right now, that 90 billion dollars would just evaporate?",

    "text": "Contact a lawyer immediately.<p>There are many actions you could take to mess with the investigation that might seem like fair game, but you should discuss each one with an attorney so you don't provide some arcane justification for them to arrest you (by hacking back, or even maybe \"interfering with an investigation\").<p>Once you get past that stage, the attorney can help you petition to stop the behavior or demand more information about it.<p>Legal advice is what you need now, not tech advice.<p>(Because the server is crushed, I'm only getting the basic gist - forgive me if you've already done this.) The only relevant piece of advice here. This is, after all, Canada: if it is indeed CSIS who setup backdoor the OP's computer, there is a paper trail. Lawyers know how to obtain this paper trail. I don't know Canadian law, but the worst I could possibly think of in any of US/UK/AU jurisdiction is that the paper trail says \"confidential, pending investigation\".<p>I should add that while the malware in question may indeed talking to CSIS servers, this could be the case the CSIS servers themselves are hacked -- more likely by an automated worm in service of spammers (and honestly this is what the 'PG' person sounds like to me -- a scammer/spammer) than any scary entity.<p>Regardless, this is a legal, not technical matter at this point. Get recommendations for a lawyer in your area (you could also try contacting the university staff for this -- they may well be required to help you find an attorney), talk to them. Avoid posting anything else to a public forum. If anyone knows a good lawyer in Montreal, please let me know!<p>nadim@nadim.cc Get in touch with the EFF:<p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance</a> Don't. They take forever as they have only so few lawyers and they're all backlogged for months. They're also not equipped for this kind of thing. Their lawyers focus more on civil suits, not criminal.. <i>&#62; EFF maintains a list of attorneys, called the Cooperating Attorneys list, who have told us that they are passionate about the same things we're passionate about, and who have indicated that they have some of the same areas of expertise. If we can't help you, but feel that your case is something our cooperating attorneys may be able to assist with, we'll offer to refer you to one of them.</i> Take that with a grain of salt. They want to sound more helpful than they actually are on their website so people will donate. I am an attorney on the Cooperating Attorneys list.  EFF regularly sends emails asking for people interested in assisting. Your claim is based on the knowledge of what actual facts?<p>(That said, I can see another problem in cases such as this: what if some of the \"volunteering lawyers\" are set by the government?). &#62; (That said, I can see another problem in cases such as this: what if some of the \"volunteering lawyers\" are set by the government?).<p>My IANAL guess is that they would still be bound by client/attorney privilege, and they'd be committing a crime if they violated that. Do you have something to back your statements? says you. More to the point the EFF's lawyers are US lawyers. Canada is an entirely different beast from the US in terms of legal system. Their separate mailing list may have Canadian lawyers, but I'd suspect that the vast majority are US lawyers. So what you are saying is that there is a chance they might be of assistance? My thoughts exactly Don't rely solely on EFF, but also don't avoid contacting them. I have a friend of a friend who contacted the EFF and was given immense help on short notice. Their lawyers do work they find interesting. Explain your situation and see what comes of it. I would also contact someone familiar with forensic analysis of malware, so you have lots of data about the monitoring that was conducted. I'm not a lawyer nor do I know any who can deal with this kind of thing.  However I do know that in Canada CSIS will not spy on citizens unless they have a warrant for it.  So getting a lawyer is a great idea at this point.  If the government is spying on you they have reasons to believe you are tied to someone who might pull you indadvertedly into something illegal. Re: \"Hacking Back\"<p>I heard that Canadian sysops are the ones that apologise when you hack them. ;-) How about he contact CSIS directly, and clarify...? \"Hello, I'm sure this is all a big misunderstanding, but did you happen to root my computer?\"<p>Not trying to be sarcastic, but I'm really curious what such an email could possibly achieve. If they tell you they <i>haven't</i> done anything, they're either lying or not - you wouldn't know. And really, what are the chances they would tell you that they <i>have</i> rooted your PC if they had? It'd likely only achieve something if someone else is trying to pull a prank either on him or CSIS, in which case drawing their attention to it might not be so bad (and of course if it's them, they already likely knows he knows, so who cares). I don't know you and I don't know the world you live in, but just from your worried tone, and the rate at which you're responding to comments in this thread, I just want to say: take a breath. Engaging in a wild HN thread, full of well meaning but varied techy suggestions/speculation might not be the best approach right now. Have some friends sift through it for good information and disengage. Seek legal advice, and take it slow. Sorry. I am very stressed and am knocked into full self-defense/damage control mode. Not sure I am in a state to meet people IRL at the moment. I strongly suggest you take a week off - don't expend valuable energyon trying to control the things that are stressing you. Check in and say hi to friends on Twitter (or suchlike) by all means, so that nobody has to worry about you, but don't put pressure on yourself to get to the bottom of this or resolve it within a certain timeframe. You haven't done anything wrong that I can see so there's no particular reason you should knock yourself out trying to untangle the situation.<p>Watch some movies, catch your regular classes (or skip a couple if you can), read that fat sci-fi novel - fill in the blank. FI anyone you don't know calls you on the phone just tell them you're not interested, goodbye, and take a rest from the internet. After a week, chat to a lawyer and work on the fact that someone is harrassing you - might be an intelligence service, might be criminals, but make it your lawyer's problem. The best thing for you right now is to recharge your batteries and that putting some distance between yourself and the source of your stress. The best way to deal with your computer being hacked is to leave it switched off; not least because your lawyer might advise handing it over to a forensic analyst for an audit.<p>But primarily, take it easy and be good to yourself. Nothing obliges you to wear yourself out responding to the behavior of others if it is making you stressed or unhappy. I think that you actually should meet someone IRL, have them stay over with you or stay over with them. Yes.. and in the meantime, I suggest all of us watch this 29c3 talk by Jacob Applebaum, \"Not My Department\" ( <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mnuofn_DXw\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mnuofn_DXw</a> ), and think about all our roles in all this. It's not going to stop unless we make it. There seems to be a new pattern where anyone involved in promoting free speech and privacy through encryption gets harassed by the state, regardless if they actually did anything illegal.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum#Investigation_and_detainment\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum#Investigation_a...</a><p>It really shows how those in power are scared of the liberating powers of technology. Although the details of the gov's investigation and harassment of Jake are largely shrouded in secrecy, his harassment at the border began right after giving a keynote at HOPE 2010 in place of Julian Assange, as the only US citizen identified in the media as a member of the Wikileaks team.<p>Although I think what the US government has done to Jake is quite clearly a disgusting abuse of power, let us not kid ourselves  by somehow believing that the state has gone after him because he has publicly advocated for the use of strong crypto. However, Phil Z <i>did</i> get harassed over strong crypto, but that was in the bad old days. I don't really know anything about this story, but do you have any guesses as to why they did go after him? <p><pre><code>  | his harassment at the border began right after\n  | giving a keynote at HOPE 2010 in place of Julian\n  | Assange\n\n  | the only US citizen identified in the media as\n  | a member of the Wikileaks team.\n</code></pre>\nI'm thinking that these two pieces of information are part of it. Interesting side note<p>Assange developed part of Truecrypt if I recall correctly. He was one of the developers of Rubberhose - a similar, earlier, tool to Truecrypt, not Truecrypt itself.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubberhose_%28file_system%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubberhose_%28file_system%29</a> What about moxie? IIRC, moxie said at some point that he was being harassed because he was a contact on Jake's phone which was confiscated by the US government at some point, so now he's associated with him. I know good part of why crypto creators are being hunted. Bit if I explain most people will just think I am crazy, so I won't.<p>But yes, there are a reason that crypto people get hunted in general ( not only wikileaks) and there are even a ground war going on in other fronts. Enlighten us with your craziness please. No judgement here. Ok, to explain in the least charged way as possible.<p>First, I will tell there are \"groups\", mind you, I only mean a collective of individuals and organisations, that many times are fighting amont themselves, also individually they may have different aims and purposes, but the \"group\" thing simplify the things.<p>Second, the subject is very ancient, so I will try to talk only about the last 100 years, because otherwise it will become a too complex thing to write about in a short post.<p>Also, I will not name the groups, because whatever name I use for each of them, have different meanings and charges to each person, resulting in a flamewar (and the reason people think I am crazy).<p>I will list the groups in order of theoretical and legal (not necessarily de facto) power.<p>Group A: This group is in power in several states, run some huge international organisations, and wants more power centralisation, individuals within it want more power to themselves.<p>The Group A is very much against cryptography technology leaking (the weapons of choice of Group E), Group A also tend to help Group C if they think it will be a blow to Group B or E, otherwise they currently use Group C as scapegoat and target to fool their subjects in giving them more power.<p>Group B is very much alike Group A, but with fundamentally different economic beliefs, Group B realised it cannot beat Group A directly, so they right now work by mostly promoting ideologies and morals that will undermine Group A centralisation of power and capacity to react, Group B also don't like Group E, and don't like crypto on Group E hands, but sometimes they might allow Group E to get that tech if it means improving their own to use against Group A.<p>Group C currently is like Group A and B, but based on religion, also Group C recently took over 4 countries, with great help of Group E and Group A, much to the regret of Group E that only now realised it was against their interests to this happen.<p>Group D only want to be left alone, but are frequently caught in the crossfire.<p>Group E are the opposite of Group A, they want more freedom, more decentralisation, and of course, more power to themselves too, but not in a hierarchy, and more splintered. Group E loves cryptography, and the reason OP is being hunted, is because he is helping Group E (on purpose or not). The only one i think i can't figure out is Group D.\nAlso, if my guesses are right, the economic beliefs of Group B are not so different from Group A anymore. I'm unsure about E also.<p>I'm really hanging on for someone to provide some names or additional info so I can do my own research rather than taking stuff at face value :/ Group A, and B, have names, that they used themselves, but those names are too charged for me to use, people will misunderstand things, and think I am talking about something else.<p>Group C probably has a name, but I don't know it.<p>All Groups, maybe with exception of B, are not much cohesive and are easier to say who belong in them.<p>So, I will say some organizations that BELONG to some groups (they are NOT the groups, they are PART of them, a small part by the way).<p>Group A: Has on it the UN, and several countries. Also has on it some esoteric organizations and religions.<p>Most people don't notice, but Thelemites (followers of Thelema) frequently align with Group A, so if you want some extra information, read about that.<p>Group B has on it the followers of Gramsci, Frankfurt School, several atheist evangelists, and part of their strategy was very much well explained by a guy named Yuri Alexandrovich Bezmenov, see if you find his interview.<p>Group C has on it Muslim Brotherhood, and Al Quaeda, \"Al Quaeda\" means \"The Foundation\", and Osama Bin Laden has read the foundation series by Isaac Asimov, so if you want to know what Group C is doing, read those books, and think about how you would apply them to present age...<p>Group D has people like the guy above that claimed to be part of F, also has countries that don't want to be dragged in all the A, B, C craziness, like some african countries, some asiatic countries, and so on.<p>Group E has among them the OP, Julian Assange, Punks (the ones from 70s), Cyberpunks, Cipherpunks, Anonymous, Libertarians, Far right groups, non-aligned christians (those that follow the bible and reject mainstream churches), a small amount of catholics, secularist arabs, conspiracy theorists, nutjobs, normal people that dislike their constitution torn apart, federalists, Catalan/Scotch/Chechen/Kurd/Touareg/Xeer/Somalilandi/Gaucho/etc... independence/autonomy movements, Occupy X/Y/Z, Indignados, Golden Dawn Party, the norwegian serial killer, lots of other random people.<p>Groups that I don't know their alignment: Shia countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon), seemly those are related to D, several people in E are helping them (and A and C are attacking them).<p>For those wondering where is Israel, Zionists and Roman Catholic Church. I will leave those out on purpose. After watching a few Bezmenov videos, i wonder if your Group B is still trying to subvert the west?<p>My believe was that the KGB had degenerated into some sort of mafia and russia was now playing the capitalist game (by their own rules of course). But then again i don't know much about those things. \"First, I will tell there are \"groups\", mind you, I only mean a collective of individuals and organisations, that many times are fighting amont themselves, also individually they may have different aims and purposes, but the \"group\" thing simplify the things.\"<p>No chance of humoring us? In what sense? I don't understood. naming the groups by their most conventional names, you gone so far as to create the dynamics of these groups, why forgo naming them? not really understanding the cloak and dagger element Probably because the name for the groups is something like \"Illuminati.\" It's possible he could just be talking about A and B being capitalists and communists though. exactly, just want to know if he is making an insightful geo-political theory on interactions between groups, or if it is hagbard celine and the yellow submarine. Hello, Group F here.<p>I'd like to point out that we like cake and tea, and amuse ourselves with getting on with stuff, while groups A-E do their best to screw it up. If A-E could just naff off and let the rest of get on with it, we'd be in a much better place. You're covered as a part of Group D, the most dangerous group: content with at best an \"enlightened hedonism\" (work diligently, but only so that you could afford that 60\" TV), while groups A-C strip away your liberty <i>and</i> safety. Heh heh, exactly. ;) That's a very smart way to discuss global factions (using \"group A\", etc.). I guess group C is Islam? Israel seems more plausible imo. Israel has an interesting relationship with its neighbour's land, but I don't think anyone would claim Israel took over 4 countries recently. I'd go with a combination of pro-democracy Islamic youth groups, MB, and AQ -- the countries being Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and...Syria? What good books/resources are there to read for those who want to know more about this? Good question...<p>First, you will understand lots of things easier if you read at least the first book of the Isaac Asimov \"Foundation\" series.<p>Then, I've been researching this for a looooong time.<p>Also you will waddle through lots of crazy stuff, trying to find the gems.<p>I only started to find out, what information matters, and what don't, what is real and what is just nutjob ideas, after I met some particular people in real life.<p>Also there are deep religious issues on this, and some fringe stuff (for example: the ex-wife and some more people related to a known member of Group A claimed that he rose to power in his country using black magic).<p>But a good start, is research about what is Thelema (and its followers), who is Antonio Gramsci, what is Frankfurt School, what is Muslim Brotherhood, the islamic plans for gold standard, Colonel Gadaffi push for gold standard, Punks, Cyberpunks and Cypherpunks, Saddam Hussein push for oil be sold for Euro (instead of USD), Sunni vs Shia wars, pro-Assad christians.<p>These are the stuff I remember where real facts are easier to find.<p>Other things that I would mention here are too bizarre and hard to understand, and filled with misinformation.<p>Also if you decide to research this stuff, caution to who you talk, you might get dragged into the thing (and let me tell you, it is not pretty, I had two serious close calls recently).<p>Of course, like the OP, you might get dragged into it anyway.<p>It may sound cliche, but fiddling with that stuff, that I learned how serious the phrase \"And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you\" is dead serious. Tell us what you can about your two serious close calls recently. I am really intrigued now :) I cannot say much, in fact I wrote a post that now I just deleted and will make a even shorter version with less information.<p>But let's say that I had a online friend, that I decided to help, and found out that this friend was a unwilling weapon of \"Group A\" that escaped, and was being searched for, and I got tangled into very hair raising stuff (including death threats toward me).<p>And I learned lots of stuff, that I wish I had not learned, the sort of stuff that make people say that \"Ignorance is Bliss\", but now that I learned, I must act upon it, there not much else to be done.<p>It was a hell of a adventure. The most scary shit I ever faced in my life, and made me get much more mature and responsible.<p>Also I almost lost my family in the process (they were very much against some actions that I did and became incredibly upset).<p>Happily they later understood everything that I did and now we are happy again. The best book I know is \"Im Namen des Staates\", unfortunately it is only available in German, a shame.<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Im-Namen-Staates-German-Edition/dp/3492230504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Im-Namen-Staates-German-Edition/dp/349...</a> What group are you part of? tl;dr Isn't that what got Sandra Bullock's character in \"The Net\"?<p>Speak to a lawyer and/or some journalists. Slow down a bit there. Whatever is happening, you need to slow down. Don't make any quick decisions. I know you may feel under a lot of pressure. Best way is to talk to someone you know and trust. A family member or a very old friend. These people love you and want the best for you. Contact them, and explain what is happening. Then with their company, analyze the situation.<p>I want you to do this. Your current position may make it not so simple. But you must slow down and regain your composure.<p>Such situations are better dealt with people who love you.<p>Postpone any harsh decision until you have met with a loved one and have explained the items.<p>Remember that there is always a way to work things out. Dont lose hope. I want you to remember that things get better. They improve. You just need to slow down and reason a bit.<p>I'm not doubting your points. But I want you to go to a safe place where you can get some rest. Tomorrow you may be able to think about this with a better understanding. You are a smart person. You always figure out hard problems. You need to rest a bit before you can tackle it. Go and stay with a loved one. They will welcome you and listen to the items you  are talking about.<p>I am orangethirty. Have been programming for a long time. I live in the Caribbean, and you can read more about me on my github (github.com/orangethirty). I'm only interested in your well being. We all want for you to regain your inner peace.<p>If you need anything, then let me know by posting here. If you feel comfortable emailing me, then do so.I am not pressuring you to do so. Do it if you feel like it.<p>I want you to remember that tomorrow is another day. Things improve. There is a way to solve every problem.<p>- orangethirty Disconnect computer from network.<p>Try to dump RAM image.<p>Image the drive, sign and optionally encrypt the contents, preferably file-by-file checksum and copy to multiple secure locations. Copy of checksums in additional secure location.<p>Get out of your house with your computer as soon as possible (as soon as you upload one or two images). Do not leave the computer, they will try to destroy or confiscate the evidence. Plan to store computer in secure location, preferably with 24/7 video monitoring and a heavy duty safe. Preserving the evidence is probably that important.<p>Try to be in the company of someone you trust so they can act as a witness and can protect you from physical intimidation or attack.<p>Assume phones are compromised including GPS on your mobile phone.

I did wonder if this bit...<p>“On January 31st, 2013, a person identifying as PG sent me an email saying that he would wish to meet to discuss a business opportunity with me.”<p>...was intended to refer to you, or if the initials PG are just a coincidence.<p>You are in the “initials club” after all (rms, jwz, esr, djb) and have even shortened the usual three letters to two. Yeah, actually I think he probably meant \"PG\" and not PG.  But by the time I realized that, someone had replied to me, and I don't like to delete comments with replies. And the name PG... very sketchy Did he learn his trade from movies or so something? What if there are 2 people in black suits? Oh, covered, he will be the one with the shaken martini. Why? My friend PG (Pieter Geelen) wears a black suit all the time. Does he work at CSIS by any chance? Nothing wrong with black suits, in London theyre very common among business people. \nNot everyone has the luxury of wearing t-shirts and jeans to the office. Black suits aren't supposed to be worn for business. They are for evening wear. They should only be worn in the day if you are a waiter, doorman, undertaker, American etc. Not black though, that's not really done - certainly not in London. Maybe the agent didn't have time to change clothes.\nOr the Agency can't afford colorful clothes :D You mean just a like a hoodie? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadim_Kobeissi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadim_Kobeissi</a> What a wonderful creature that young man is.

(sorry, I couldn't resist) They are both high profile (for activists/hackers). Public twitter accounts, etc. It seems ridiculous that an \"intelligence\" organization would upload files to a server that identified themselves so blatantly like that.  Could it be that it is some ruse of some sort?  I don't doubt that someone broke in, but would it really be CSIS? An actual exploit like this designed to monitor the hacked computer would likely either talk to a small range of IPs in the infiltrating organization, or a widely scattered botnet.<p>Trying to contact a small variety of servers of various disparate government agencies seems more like an attempt to generate false evidence that the victim is actually a dangerous hacker.<p>Or at least that's what Stephenson, Doctorow, and Gibson have trained me to think. CSIS aren't the most competent intelligence organization in the world. For the limited scope of the work that they do (which is essentially limited to what the NSA does in the US. They don't really do what the CIA does), and with a relatively small $600 million dollar public budget, they're known to be quite competent.<p>This story sounds...weird. I doubt it is quite as he suspects it is. I think you've got it mixed up:  CSIS [0] is the Canadian CIA, having been created in the wake of shutting down Department D of the RCMP after one too many scandals in the 1970s.  The Canadian NSA is the CSE [1].<p>[0] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Security_Establishment_Canada\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Security_Establi...</a> CSEC, now.  I'm thinking of interning there in the summer. You aren't now.<p>I happen to know that upon applying you are directly told not to tell anyone you applied, or even that you were thinking of applying. No, only thinking of it. Then you aren't anymore. &#62;which is essentially limited to what the NSA does in the US.<p>The NSA doesn't do field intelligence work, AFAIK, unlike CSIS.<p>&#62;This story sounds...weird. I doubt it is quite as he suspects it is.<p>It's weird, but I'm not sure who else other than CSIS would have the motivation to hack an activists computer so it sends data to CSIS-affiliated servers. The author said \"Hostnames that appear to belong to CSIS.\". Reverse DNS should not be trusted. Saying that a hostname \"appears to belong\" to someone is a naive statement. Indeed, spoofing reverse DNS is not hard -- and spoofing reverse DNS to appear like an intelligence agency is straight out of every 1990s IRC script kiddie's cookbook. Which one is? I put the Mosad up there, but most are summed up by the statement: Reward for failure. Screw up, get given a bigger budget so it doesn't happen again. Even high-profile organizations have a spectrum of competence within their offices. Don't assume they act intelligently, just because they have \"intelligence\" in the name. Many people who make the decisions aren't IT experts at all. I was thinking it was a false-flag scenario as well.  Other than the network identifiers, there's nothing to say it was the Canadians behind it. This guy should widely distribute the SFTP creds being used by the backdoor agent on his computer. Then we could all be helpful by uploading useful data to the Canadian government's spy server. If he was backdoored by a 3/4-letter and he is not skilled[1] in malware analysis how likey do you think it is that he will recover the credentials? Do you think it is as easy as:<p><pre><code>  $ ls -l ~/.ssh\n  total 80\n  -rw-------+   1 nadim  staff   737 Aug 22 01:39 authorized_keys\n  -rw-------+   1 nadim  staff    35 Jan  5 21:32 config \n  -rw-------+   1 nadim  staff  3243 Aug 18 10:57 id_rsa\n  -rw-------+   1 nadim  staff   735 Aug 18 10:57 id_rsa.pub\n  -rw-------+   1 nadim  staff  3326 Feb  2 21:41 id_rsa_CSIS\n  -rw-------+   1 nadim  staff   749 Feb  2 21:41 id_rsa_CSIS.pub\n  -rw-------+   1 nadim  staff  3198 Feb  2 21:46 known_hosts\n\n\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] I have no reason to think he does or does not posses this skill. I only mention it in the negative because it was not in his wikipedia bio. While an amusing suggestion, I sincerely hope everyone realises that such a move would be ... incompatible with a long and healthy lifestyle. Both for Nadim and anyone foolish enough to do so. On the other hand, anyone who has reason to believe there might be information critical to their investigation embedded in the full version of Two Girls One Cup, it is their civic duty to submit that video to the authorities. But sneaking it in through a backdoor and smearing it on their server is probably not going to be well received. (any unintentional puns are entirely unintentional). Why?<p>Are you suggesting the CSIS kill people? Who are going to be missed because they have said they are under surveilance? Or even abroad? I am suggesting pissing off CSIS, or any law enforcement body, is not a good idea. I doubt you will be outright killed on purpose, but arrested, detained and interrogated is a reasonable risk. Worst (reasonable) case is being jailed for \"interfering in an investigation\" or \"unauthorised access to computers\" or such like.<p>Magikarp is doing everything right so far. He doesn't need to cross a line by exposing CSIS servers to attack. And nobody else needs to play with CSIS servers either.<p>Protest and demonstration is one thing, but playing with law enforcement servers is like throwing bottles at police cars for the lulz and is just asking for the book to be thrown back at you. CSIS is not nearly as eager to unjustly violate personal freedoms out of spite as its American counterparts seem to be. even though i am not \"allowed\" in canada currently, i found the govt folks to be pretty reasonable when i had to interact with them. What did you do to cause yourself to consider your Canada privileges revoked? Felony conviction as a non-Canadian-Citizen? I have asked before, but why would you want to live in countries where this train of thought is a possible reality? Although chances are not great 'it will happen to you', anything over 0% is far too great for my taste. I entirely agree, which is the main reason why I am not interested in working in China again. But we don't live in a perfect world, compromises need to be made and living in a Western democracy is about the best you can do for your rights. Beyond that I feel you get into diminishing returns. At some point your treatment is based on the whims of the law enforcement officers and their particular culture which is very hard to measure and changes and evolves over time and political environments anyway.<p>Do you have evidence of any particularly good countries? It is possible that someone is playing a bad prank on Nadim, or that Nadim made the story up to gain attention.<p>Please read on. If this is real, then I'm sorry and recommend you to consider all suggestions before deciding illogical.<p>DON'T COMMIT SUICIDE!<p>If you watched the movie \"Enemy of the State\", I'd become paranoid, but not afraid. Stay calm and act logical.<p>I've looked at cryptocat two days ago, what's special about it? I don't see any reason for the Government to observe you, except that you would be a good fit into their Cyberwar Team. And that you have the wrong connections in the internet. I mean your friends are all hackers. It makes you appear dangerous too. Anyway, the government observes everyone, but with different priority and detail. I think only you might know why they observe you. No need to share the info.<p>Just as in the Movie: I'd replace all clothes, shoes and hardware with new ones and move to a different place. Acquire encryption software from a trusted source or compile it myself on a newly obtained Netbook and encrypt the hardrive+swap with a password and keyfile. Hide the keyfile. Put your hardware and new phone into a cool faradaybag.com. Stay in public, but personally invincible. Leak everything that isn't harmful for you using delayed transmissions with ifttt.com. Always have multiple copies of important documents, just for the case it's necessary.<p>Oh and I'd get a weapon and buy a bulletproof jacket (not vest). Avoid any contact to officials should be priority. \nUse Tor and VPNs like spotflux, hide.io, ovpn.to etc. and inform close friends to guard you.<p>+Trust no one. I don't think that buying a weapon and a bulletproof jacket is logical in his situation. Seems quite counterproductive to me when dealing with officials. I think a bulletproof jacket is logical if his life is in danger.<p>Yes, I agree on the weapon, every signal that can pull the trigger of an official's gun should be avoided. But I think not having a weapon maybe careless too, only he knows what's right in his situation. A stupid move when confronted with officials could cause him more harm than wearing a gun. A weapon is just an excuse to get shot. Don't be armed. You can't fight an intelligence agency with guns. I'd assume \"Trust no one\" would include your very post? Movies are fiction, to base one's reactions &#38; responses on it is silly.<p>What he needs is legal &#38; political help. You're right sir. I think he shouldn't trust anyone, but still consider the suggestions seriously. Legal help is surely his highest priority.<p>Btw. almost if not all of the fiction described in that movie has become a real threat. Not taking them into consideration is silly. The interesting part of this to me is that I'm curious how, exactly, a computer owned by an undisputed computer security expert was successfully backdoored.  Presumably he isn't clicking on spear-phishing emails and the like.  If they physically accessed the machine, e.g. they sent Jason Bourne in to bug his machine, he's probably headed for some trouble at some point.  In general that kind of thing isn't done just for the purposes of poking around. Remote-ownage exploits do happen, and there is no reasonable defence against them until they are patched. And given the frequency of exploits being found in common user components such as browsers and content (flash/pdf) plugins, an usual well secured computer still is vulnerable to multiple exploits any day of the week.<p>Of course, he doesn't seem 'valuable' enough to spend a fresh 0-day on him alone as the government backdoors (Flame and friends) did with multiple 0-days included; but I'd guess that every large gov't has a standard rootkit and knows a few vulnerabilities not yet disclosed/patched - it's really not that hard/expensive to do, you can just spend a million and buy that stuff from private researchers. I agree: I'd be formatting the machine and putting it on sale or eBay and then I'd buy a new machine.  Nothing illegal here.<p>Now if he's in trouble simply because he works in the security field, this is a bit concerning.  The lawyer advice is the sound one: fight legally the system and bring this to court if the attacker did anything illegal.<p>Of course you have to laugh hard at the mediocrity of the second part of the \"attack\": directly contacting servers which can be reverse-looked up.  Doh!<p>But it still begs the question as to how his computer got owned in the first place. &#62;<i>Of course you have to laugh hard at the mediocrity of the second part of the \"attack\": directly contacting servers which can be reverse-looked up. Doh!</i><p>Is it mediocrity, or is it intended in order to send a message?<p>\"We are on to you\", etc? I'd say imaginary myself.  I'm curious what the systems were that were obviously csis systems.  He failed to include any logs or information beyond his claims. Failed implies he tried. He didn't try. He just told the story.<p>People seem to know the guy. I'm not sure this is \"imaginary\" at all. The problem is you have a person who constantly has more and more amazing stories like this that he pushes everywhere with no proof.  Logs or the hostnames or anything is pretty simple proof but require work to make up beyond a story.  He put so much effort into detailing it why leave them out?  That is why I want to see some sort of proof before I just believe his claims. yet another cry for attention from this talented but misguided young man. First it was TSA and Homeland, now the Canadian CSIS -please! You yell and scream about silent circle, about Skype -you demean and disrespect other noted cryptographers when they get press....I work for the govt -your little Hello-Kitty plug in is akin to sugar koolaid. There are many senior experienced folks here that would make great mentors. Get a good mentor -but please stop with the high-school drama. its not reality. I am too old to placate this and someone needs to bring this young man under his wing. He has a future if he stops pining for attention. ?The last thing society needs it his talent being co-opted.  His software is a clever little tool and helps to strike a balance between overarching security organizations and the citizens they're supposed to protect. Sure it is not enterprise class but good enough is pretty damn good.\nI think you while he could learn from you tecnically, you could learn a lot from him as a citizen. Good enough isn't good in crypto when people are trusting it for secure communications. Also why what's the difference (functionally) between cryptocat and pidgin/adium with OTR turned on? In the latter case I believe you can even use gtalk securely. Would be interesting to hear more details about which software he's using (OS, \"Secure File Transfer desktop client\", firewall).<p>Also, it would be interesting to see what one could find on a raw disk image clone (hidden files? rootkits?). Hello, I'm the person who wrote the blog post.<p>I am using Transmit for Mac OS X, by Panic Software, version 4.2. Unless you had logs in Transmit indicating it was used, I would recommend not saying they used Transmit to do it - considering OS X has a builtin command-line sftp client:<p><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sftp.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/...</a><p>If you're still concerned your machine is affected, I'd recommend getting Little Snitch - which automatically blocks connections (both in-bound and out-bound) that are not pre-approved. In addition, when it auto-blocks it records the application that was making the connection attempt in the auto-block rule.<p>(Well, actually I'd suggest you dd a backup of the drive to analyze - then wipe and start anew.)<p>If they hired anyone of any worth, the person installed a timed launchd (or cron) controlled script to run rarely and at odd hours to upload content from your machine to those remote locations. This kind of setup a.) would use a command-line tool for the upload and b.) unless they knew you had Transmit it would be designed around executables already included in OS X or that they installed.<p>Unfortunately, if it has stopped, they've probably deleted the scripts and cleaned up the evidence. If you've got Time Machine running, however, you may have backed up some of their handiwork. OK, the <i>proper</i> way to do this is to not touch the machine at all.  Shut it down and leave it alone.  Maybe borrow its hard drive and back it up using 'dd'.<p>Set up a separate Linux (etc) machine with two ethernet ports as a firewall/router, running wireshark in addition to everything else.  It can now log all packets in and out of your network, and save them for later analysis.<p>If nothing interesting happens in the time it takes you to get bored, copy just the files you really need across from your old HDD to a shiny new one. Given that the author of the blog post seems to understand cryptography - but doesn't seem to have much in the way of the forensics skill set - I did intentionally try to keep my post at the general consumer level (though I did mention dd, like you suggested).<p>The real -legal- solution is to turn the computer off, stop touching it, and get a lawyer specializing in computer crimes. Get the machine to them so they can make an image of the drive, complete with hashes of the filesystem, so that they can prove it hasn't been tampered with past that point.<p>Then let -them- do the investigation, with someone that has the documented skills a court would recognize.<p>Thank you for your response, though. I was just trying to be a little more practical. Good point(s).<p>I was more addressing the techical \"How can I tell if my computer is haunted?\" question than the original poster's legal issues, on which I am not at all qualified to speculate. Which firewall are you using? The one builtin on OSX? I don't want to hijack the thread, but I am using the built-in OS X firewall.<p>Anything wrong with that? &#62; Anything wrong with that?<p>If you want to protect against the kind of attach he hypothesizes to have experienced, yes. Trying to catch root backdoor on your machine by running a firewall on that same machine won't be much help. He called it an \"external firewall\", so I imagine it was a separate machine that noticed the outgoing requests. That I understand, but I was wondering if there were inherent problems with the standard FW. Yes, there are inherent problems with the built-in firewall. The bad guys know it is there so any exploit that they install will likely modify the firewall to cover their tracks. External firewalls can be trusted more than built-in software. I would be surprised if the built-in firewall even blocks any outgoing connections by default. I'm not on my MBP at the moment so I can't check for sure. Nope, just want to know (since I use it too but i'm looking for something better) transmit can be scripted so it could be anything running on the machine that is backdoored.<p>i assume they had connection for sending commands that was separate because the sftp sounds like it was blocked but the uploading stopped apparently in response to external stimuli. seems kind of lame to have some kind of connection sending commands and then using transmit to upload files. How did they get access to your hardware? No disk encryption?<p>Might be crazy, but when I travel I setup a webcam in my office to upload to a vps and then ustream 24/7. Highest quality (don't care about bw since nobodies home.) Hello,\nI left for NYC for five days. Since I develop sensitive cryptography software, I do not store anything sensitive on my desktop, only on my laptop, which is kept with me at all times (even when going on dates and such.) It was my desktop that exhibited this behaviour after my 5 day trip to NYC. Stupidly, I left it on the whole time. I do use full disk encryption. This is an interesting mindset...I'm inclined to do the inverse, because of how easy it is for someone to steal a laptop.<p>While yes, a desktop can be breached (as it apparently was in this case), there's more surveillance options you have with which to secure its surroundings. And agents would have to get a warrant anyway.<p>If you're worried about the prospect of them warantlessly breaking in...I guess that the more likely danger is that if they are willing to resort to that, they are also willing to stage a robbery in which someone punches you in the face and makes off with the laptop. Or hire someone to spike your drink during a date. It's trivial to put a keylogger+rootkit on an unattended desktop than on a laptop in your bag. Stealing hardware can't be prevented, but the risk is mitigated by good full disk encryption. The point is to surveil him, not steal his laptop.  They would want to know what he's doing, not what's on his hard drive. HN is a public forum. You really shouldn't post this sort of info here (unless you're trying to actively mislead whoever is targeting you).<p>As somebody else said: take a deep breath, take over 9000 backups, and start reducing your attack surface without falling to complete paranoia. Do you backup the information stored on the laptop? Are you worried about being \"mugged\"? I am reasonably worried about being mugged at this point. The FBI has already tried to entrap me less than a year ago.<p>In fact, that's why I published this blog post. To protect myself. Good. Publish everything. Prepare to be mugged now that it is known where you keep the family jewels. What's the desktop's uptime? You're paranoid, man. Take a deep breath. See a doctor if you can. Seriously? He has perfectly valid concerns and you call him paranoid? I guess we know who the CSIS agents are. With physical access, one could at least theoretically backdoor the boot partition and then \"rootkit\" (\"bootkit\"?) the rest of the machine. Sure, but a reboot would be obvious, and writing to a partition while the OS has it mounted seems like it could go quite poorly... It's actually not all that uncommon for well-written rootkits to do just that. Cool, I learned something. I guess the boot partition is likely to be inactive, and with a ffs-derived file system you can simply overwrite some file in place with your own functionality. E.g., replace some unused driver code with your rootkit, which loads itself on probe. You could use something like Motion ( <a href=\"http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome</a> ) it only records when there is activity. The post does say <i>Ever since my return from NYC</i> as when the activity has been encountered.  Since I'm guessing that he didn't have his external firewall with him on travel, the access could have taken place in an airport or anytime in the US.<p>It would be interesting to hear if/when he didn't have direct control of his laptop while on travel. I doubt he brought his desktop with him to NYC.  It's the desktop that's acting suspiciously. True, but if his laptop has been compromised while he was traveling, that could have been used to get access to the home system. I'd like to know more information.<p>As it's written this seems to be a very confused article to me. What exactly is the author's point in writing this? And what is his next step moving forward?<p>What operating system does he use, what software under that operating system (specifically the FTP client), does he have a secure firewall, etc. etc. Mac OS X, Transmit by Panic Software (v. 4.2) — I blogged this in order to protect myself. Why do you use Transmit? Panic's software is known (amongst people who do reverse engineering) for having many holes.<p>If you're doing really security sensitive work don't run questionable software which you don't have the source code for. As someone who uses Transmit... what would you recommend instead? Command-line sftp? Very curious to look at your logs. Pastebin? Wow, thanks for the fast reply!<p>Can you tell me what your next steps in proceeding are, or would this violate the protection you're attempting to set up? I am currently in a state of shock and rage. I am contacting helpful friends, documenting every shred of detail for my own protection, and mirroring evidence to multiple servers in order to prevent it from being erased.<p>Helpful advice is more than welcome. Two bits of advice for what to do after backing up evidence:<p>1. If you suspect the machine was tampered with, do not use it again.  There are a lot of places a backdoor could be hiding, even after you reinstall the OS.<p>2. If you do not do so already, use smartcards for crypto.  Don't store keys on your machine.  It is easier to carry a card around than a computer, and smartcards are harder to brute force. Can you recommend a smartcard? The easiest one to buy in small quantities is probably the GPG smartcard, although I have not had much luck with it in the low-end reader that my laptop has (YMMV but the same folks that sell GPG smartcards also sell card readers that should work).  Otherwise, I am only aware of cards that are only sold in bulk i.e. for corporate and government use. Yubikey is an option. If you have not shut down the machine, I would do a memory acquisition (<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/lime-forensics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://code.google.com/p/lime-forensics/</a>, can be analyzed with Volatility) and a raw disk acquisition (you can use dd) and get to someone for forensic investigation to look for rootkits and other evidence of tampering. If you feel like having a mirror in an EU country let me know, email in profile. Nice try, CSIS. (Just kidding.) The same, in Paraguay :-)\nPoor bandwidth but enough storage. Just let me know if I can be of any help to you. I'm sure you know very well how to record and preserve data, so I won't advise you on that note.<p>But you should try to script something quickly which will automate these actions for you. And you should also try to make a bot to investigate the \"backdoor\" more.<p>Aside from your evidence, is there anything that has happened in the past that would lead you to being a target for the NCIS? He is of Lebanese ancestry and studied in Lebanon for 2 years thus he likely speaks Arabic and has Arabic speaking friends. This alone could be enough if someone among his acquaintances has terrorist links. In addition he was one of the first to speak out about Bradley Manning's arrest, in his support, which raises the possibility that he has connections with WikiLeaks, lulzsec, etc. That is enough for CSIS to investigate him. He also has traveled to the USA which is where the FBI gets involved and, of course, anything regarding terrorist connections or lulzsec brings in the CIA. Quite frankly he is not a clean person and should not be developing software like this. If you were a business executive with shady dealings, would you want to use software from this guy? Would you trust him not to install a backdoor? And would you take the risk of travelling across an international border with a copy of this software knowing that 3-letter agencies associate it with terrorism? What \"shady dealings\" is he accused of apart from being Lebanese and expressing an opinion on Bradley Manning? He is a person. He is being attacked because he has a conscience, actually likes to protect the freedom 3 letter agencies are out to destroy while claiming the opposite, and pays more than lip service to it. Thanks for the bootlicking demonstration. I don't feel as though you know enough about the man or his situation to make these judgements. So since he's Arab and involved in activism we shouldn't use his software, interesting. Even more interesting is you seem to be getting upvotes. Congrats, ass. Nice try CIA You'll be OK :-) Keep calm and carry on.\nThat's all the advice I have. I find the idea that Nadim is under surveillance to not be unrealistic. I don't believe he would be under surveillance for his programming. Whether for his associates is another thing.<p>I don't believe the people he alleges he spoke with are intelligence operatives. Whoever they are, they were almost surely messing with him (but could still be conventional employees of an intelligence agency.) Whether or not they're for real doesn't change my first paragraph though.<p>I'm not able to give any advice except this: As long as you're on this road, there is no one you can fully trust. No one at all. You haven't fully internalized this yet. I'm pretty sure that no legitimate covert service operative would identify themselves as such, nor would they brag about going to conferences. Working for CSIS doesn't mean that you're a <i>covert</i> operative.  I know plenty of present and past employees of CSIS, CSEC, CIA, NSA, GCHQ, etc -- my understanding is that the general rule is \"don't call attention to your affiliation, but it's ok to say if evading questions would draw even more attention to you\". this whole account sounds patently ridiculous considering the nature of cryptocat.<p>i would like to think that \"CSIS\" had better things to do. Spying on and harassing activists has, for a long time, been a big part of what CSIS does. I personally know tech activists that have been spied on and harassed. The RCMP is also known for this.<p>Mainstream new story from a couple weeks ago in which activist orgs complained of CSIS harassment:<p><a href=\"http://www.ctvnews.ca/activists-warn-against-csis-intimidation-tactics-1.760797\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ctvnews.ca/activists-warn-against-csis-intimidati...</a> Investigating people who are doing unusual things is part of their job.  In cases like the Occupy movement, it's entirely appropriate for them to say \"gee, something's going on -- it seems mostly peaceful so far, but does it have the potential to become violent later?\" and investigate. <i>Spying on and harassing activists has, for a long time, been a big part of what CSIS does.</i><p>Give me a break.<p>Canada has a very open door immigration policy. Unfortunately that open door draws in people who actually don't like what Canada is about (which makes it weird that they would come here) and who conspire against, effectively, Canadian society. I <i></i>welcome<i></i> that law enforcement cares about this and does normal investigations.<p>Further from a corporate perspective it is well known that China, in particular, is going absolutely rampant with corporate espionage in the West. This is a major concern.<p>Or just call it some sort of \"anti-activism\" creed. &#62;Unfortunately that open door draws in people who actually don't like what Canada is about ... Or just call it some sort of \"anti-activism\" creed.<p>Sounds like what you're saying is that because CSIS does some legitimate things it means they don't also do less legitimate things, like harass/spy on activists. Perhaps the confusion is because CSIS spying on people is a legit thing. Writing cryptography tools, and activism in general, aren't illegal and people who don't break laws should not be spied on or harassed. If they knew who the lawbreakers were, they wouldn't need to spy on anyone. Good logic to justify blanket domestic surveillance. I personally know and have seen the logs from an activist who has CSIS host-names show up in his blog for the past few years. This came after the G8 fiasco in Toronto, where they pulled him in for questioning. <i>I personally know and have seen the logs from an activist who has CSIS host-names show up in his blog for the past few years.</i><p>So? I have the CIA appear in my blog logs and have for years. People work there, and some of them like blogs. Is that, apparently, \"harassment\"? They do spy on and harass First Nations activists, notoriously. Surely all 2500 CSIS agents are busy harassing the other three high-profile 23 year old crypto hacktivists in Canada Same goes for the DHS. Yet, from the Wikipedia article about Cryptocat:<p><i>Cryptocat developer Nadim Kobeissi was detained and questioned at the U.S. border by the DHS in June 2012 about its censorship resistance.</i> If you need donations for any legal pursuits, set up a page accepting bitcoins or similar.<p>I'd totally support this.<p>Illegally monitoring a citizen has to about as bad as it gets in my books. Especially someone who has never done anything illegal and only received attention by building tools to help free speech/privacy. Illegally monitoring anyone, citizen or not, is excessive and supremely uncool. Actually it is not excessive. It is legal for CSIS to monitor non-citizens and it is even legal for them to investigate citizens if they may be assisting foreigners that Canada disapproves of. I was interviewed by CSIS because I did some technical work on a server for a foreign-born Canadian who was suspected of being involved in white-power/neo-nazi orgs. The goal of CSIS was to find out if a certain prominent foreign white-power speaker might sneak into Canada. There was a well-known leaky spot in the US border not far from the town where this guy lived.<p>This Nadim fellow is a suspicious guy doing suspicious things who travels to terrorist hot-spots and to the USA, which is also suspicious. And I bet that CSIS is reading every word on HN right now. After all, where do you think that CSIS finds the hackers to set up the kind of hacks that Nadim has described? Same goes for CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS. &#62; Actually it is not excessive. It is legal for CSIS to monitor non-citizens and it is even legal for them to investigate citizens if they may be assisting foreigners that Canada disapproves of.<p>Just because something is legal doesn't mean its not excessive. Just because the government does something, doesn't make it right. &#62; After all, where do you think that CSIS finds the hackers to set up the kind of hacks that Nadim has described?<p>From the description of what happened I'd guess probably at the local high school, by asking if anyone likes Bond movies. &#62; <i>\"And I bet that CSIS is reading every word on HN right now.\"</i><p>Well, on that off chance, let me be the one to say to our CSIS guys and gals: for fsck sake, <i>don't do something like this</i>. We could all use some better role models, and the number of comments and votes on this thread reflect how monumentally-offensive the suggestion is. &#62; \"This Nadim fellow is a suspicious guy doing suspicious things\"<p>Nadim is a smart guy working in computer science. What would the reaction be if he were Dr. Kobeissi and a computer science professor? I would wait for some proof before throwing this kid money. Magikarp, out of curiosity, why do you think the CSIS want to spy on you?<p>1) Because you are an anti-surveillance activist.<p>2) Because they want to eventually backdoor Crytocat in order to spy on the users.<p>3) Because the FBI asked CSIS to spy on you, and the FBI has their own motives. all 3? I am inclined to believe this is some sort of publicity stunt. This is based on the same amount of evidence that has been presented to the contrary :) Absolutely. Do a little more than surface level digging and this guy is really just a child playing with toys and announcing it loudly to the world. Smart teenage coder turned activist... Reminds me of Aaron Swartz, surprised no one mentioned his name yet... Sorry but respectively, no. I can't allow you to trash Aaron's name like that. Aaron was actually a child prodigy and a borderline genius who had done more than this at 14 years old. This kid plays with JavaScript and wrote a chrome extension that adheres to the XMPP spec. They're not in the same league. It's ironic that you keep calling him \"kid\", yet he's obviously accomplished more than you. Is this veiled jealousy, or what?<p>In any case: Please take the time to actually understand the difference between XMPP and OTR. You have repeatedly and very confidently shown a fundamental misunderstanding of their function and implementation in this thread. I was not trashing Aaron, and sorry if it came off sounding that way. I was just trying to draw a parallel between two teenage hackers who became activists, and raised the ire of the government. Would you mind showing us what you've found so far? Is the OP sure those were CSIS peeps?  Just wondering based on how they bumbled through their attempts at making contact. Thought intelligence agents would be slicker than that. Maybe this is the new guy, and it's his first assignment. Maybe it's not CSIS, but some other interested party. Seriously though, they're gov't employees, the hiring process does not guarantee the highest quality in every case. Fair point, until the bit where his PC is trying to send information to the CSIS. Actually they're not agents, but officers. IIRC the agents are the informants who are not working for the agency. I may or may not have any comments about your situation. Nevertheless, anyone responding to these comments needs to know that there is no guarantee that magikarp is actually Nadim himself, whether the account is compromised and so on. Catch 22 is in full mode in this thread and I would hope that this is not simply paranoia kicking in.<p>Hypothetically, what is the benefit of airing out of all this information ? <i>Hypothetically, what is the benefit of airing out of all this information ?</i><p>Media attention. That seems to be all this kid has done is wave things at the media that the media themselves don't understand. Cryptocat is a javascript implementation of XMPP with OTR enabled. <i>Snore</i>... Hop on Google chat and click \"Off the record\" and you've done the same thing cryptocat does. Unlike google chat you have to load up yet another Chrome browser extension that will no doubt eat more memory.<p>The \"anapnea\" thing he was involved in looks like a joke as well. \"Encrypted tunneling network\"? You mean a VPS you give people SSH access to? Mind blowing.<p>Nothing to see here folks. Move along. Google's \"off the record\" has nothing to do with the OTR protocol. It only instructs the server to stop archiving the conversation, and does not involve end-to-end crypto. Google still has access to the cleartext as it passes through their servers. <i>Google still has access to the cleartext as it passes through their servers.</i><p>Right, and cryptocat doesn't, 'cuz they said so on their website! The first implementation of Cryptocat was bad in this regard, but the new version uses OTR. OTR virtually guarantees that a middle man can't interpret your communications by performing public key authentication and key negotiation--similar to SSL with mutual authentication using a shared secret (see <a href=\"http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html</a>, particularly the section on the Socialist Millionaires' Protocol.) You don't have to trust anyone to transport your data without snooping. Not only that, Cryptocat's new implementation is open source: <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat</a>.<p>Inform yourself, ignoramus. As you said. \"Virtually\". All of this relies on you trusting the third party involved here and that was my point. Whether its Google or some 23 year old kid, or if its open source or not doesn't matter.<p>He is quite literally doing the same thing as I could do in setting us open fire on a box and inviting everyone to conne t and turn on their client side OTR. Just because it's a chrome extension and written in JavaScript somehow changes that? No. &#62; As you said. \"Virtually\". All of this relies on you trusting the third party involved here and that was my point.<p>No, it doesn't. That's not what \"virtually\" means. It's guaranteed, barring some unexpected advance against one of the cryptographic algorithms used. In cryptography you use words like \"essentially\" or \"infeasible\", not \"completely\" and \"impossible,\" because at the end of the day you are just hiding behind hard math problems.<p>The whole point of OTR is that you <i>don't</i> have to trust the third party, and you obviously do not understand that. They are just a transport. The analogy you are making could just as well be applied to any ISP inbetween you and the person you are talking to. They are a transport. Don't trust the client? Use another. Or are you seriously suggesting writing your own? Then you're starting down a very long path: <a href=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html</a><p>You also keep comparing it to Google's \"no log\" feature, but they have absolutely nothing in common. The \"specs are not different\"; they are completely different things.<p>It's disappointing that you're so stubborn, arrogant, insulting to the author, and wrong at the same time. OTR is a brilliant and fascinating protocol, particularly because it gives people who communicate deniability, which PGP, for example, doesn't. Cryptocat is helping popularize it, and that's good. &#62; OTR is a brilliant and fascinating protocol, particularly because it gives people who communicate deniability, which PGP, for example, doesn't.<p>This is a point which a lot of people seem to overlook.  Sometimes, non-repudiation is desirable.  Sometimes it is not. You're quite cocky for being so hilariously wrong. \"Off the record\" in GTalk makes it not log your conversation in your \"Chats\" folder. It has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with encryption or deniability. I'm sorry, I thought this was \"hacker\" news. I Expected people would know that Google's OTR and OTR XMPP spec are different. My point was that you shouldn't be using 3rd party services to talk to people if the information is legitimately sensitive. The specs are not \"different.\" They are completely different things.<p>You realize it is impossible to talk to somebody over the Internet, or in real life except in person, without relying on a third party, right? You choose who to trust, and OTR, the protocol, makes it so you only have to worry about the software used, not about the communications channel and anyone listening in on it. <i>&#62; Google's OTR and OTR XMPP spec are different</i><p><i>&#62; The specs are not different. They are completely different things.</i><p>Do you not have any reading comprehension? That's literally what I said. I haven't said anything against OTR at all. I fully support the use of XMPP and OTR for communications. You can attack me all you'd like, it doesn't change anything I said. &#62; Hop on Google chat and click \"Off the record\" and you've done the same thing cryptocat does.<p>This is <i>literally</i> what you said.<p>&#62; You can attack me all you'd like<p>I don't think I'm attacking you, but after being this insulting to Nadim Kobeissi, in this thread and on Twitter, you don't get to play hurt. If this is true - we live in a scary world.\nIf not, the guy has talent in marketing. We live in a scary world either way. Haha! You are so right (unfortunately). Since you have already published so much of this story. How about full disclosure and post the actual hostnames, firewall entries and that email you received? What's the story with everyone calling each other 'friend' in this post? Is this some crypto community thing I'm not aware of or just coincidence? Canadians. A <i>cryo</i>- community then. For a hacker site, why are so few people interested in seeing his logs?<p>I hope Nadim does a full write-up, including these, soon.<p>In the meantime, all the best and keep your (thankfully already) level head. They're caught up in the moment, I'm guessing. My first reaction was <i>\"where are the logs? show me some kind of actual proof\"</i>. Otherwise this is just some kid who's paranoid and has a rootkit on his machine or something. I'm somewhat surprised that the cryptocat project has been ruffling so many feathers (assuming that the story is in fact what it appears to be). Phil Zimmerman (PGP) knows a thing or two about what happens when you make cryptography/encryption that is not easily known/keyed/trapdoored for national security agencies.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann</a> i know the author (nadim) is in here and this is all a bit fantastic. cryptocat is one of many crypto snake-oil products that i would never consider using for any kind of secure communication.<p>using defective crypto products is much riskier than not using any crypto at all and exercising caution. cryptocat has always seemed a poorly disguised honeypot to me. It would be nice if you could meet me for coffee and say this to my face, friend.<p>I am trying to protect myself and my open source project, which, by the way, has been audited countless times and has progressed greatly towards security. If you have a problem with me, then call me up and discuss it instead of stressing me out even more when I just discovered that the government is building a case against me.<p>If you don't like my work, file a bug report. Check out our documentation. Review our OTR implementation. Submit a pull request. Hack some code. Just don't say hurtful and untrue things like that in public. You can do better. I think that the reason you are seeing this response towards your project is that it's not entirely clear what it is intended for. As in who cares about security enough to encrypt their messages but not enough to install a standalone client, which has a stricter security model.<p>That being said, I think it's a cool project and it seems to be pissing off all the right people, so keep it up. And I'm not a lawyer but I don't think that the gov't has a case against you (or am I missing something). In fact, it would appear that this might be warrantless wiretapping so you might have a case against them, but I'm not sure if that is something you want to pursue. \"As in who cares about security enough to encrypt their messages but not enough to install a standalone client, which has a stricter security model.\"<p>this is <i>so</i> spot on. secure comms have no place in a web browser, which is a complex beast with a large set of underlying dependencies. webkit vulnerabilities leading to comms being blown is a crappy architecture.<p>people who care about comms use a standalone client and a separate server. if you care about the integrity of the server, you run some disk crypto, DDR3 memory, secure it physically, etc. Are you recommending DDR3 memory because you think it's resistant to cold boot or reset attacks?<p>That is not the case. DDR3 memory will not help you. Certainly DDR3 memory (as a type of main memory) has less permanence than hard disks (i.e. secondary storage).  It's a side effect not a desired goal.<p>Especially if you're bit-flipping sensitive stuff, there's probably a good hope for protection from recovery at normal temperature after what, 30-60 seconds?  So reset is an issue, but \"keep sensitive things in RAM vs. on disk\" is still a reasonable security precaution. maybe they meant ECC memory? Is ECC more secure than regular consumer grade memory? More \"secure\" from single bit errors, but not for recovery -- kind of the opposite goal.  The big difference is DRAM (mostly the same, including DDR3) vs. SRAM (of several types -- relevant due to use in HSMs, cpu cache, etc.).  DRAM has been getting worse/longer duration as it becomes lower power, so arguably DDR3 (being relatively new) would be worse than 1985 RAM.<p>CPU registers are the safest place against this attack (hence stuff like TRESOR where AES keys are held in CPU registers), but are by necessity limited (especially on x86; SPARC was better, and some of the new extensions to x86 help (SSE, etc.)<p>Most of this has been mitigated to some extent by periodic inversion of sensitive strings in main memory (keys, usually) -- this has been implemented in ~all crypto libraries.<p>SRAM's huge advantage is you can clear it faster than DRAM, but that doesn't help if you can somehow prevent the clearing from happening. \"secure comms have no place in a web browser,\"\nAgreed. Any good stand alone stuff you could suggest? \nAlso, why cryptocat is browser plugin? Why not also make stand alone version? Like with contacts and such ( I know aka \"skype with list of contacts you have secret conversations with that you don't want anyone to know about\" would be silly but would have it's uses if it would also keep cryptocat style of \"join public room and then go to private conversation\") Law enforcement officers come to you with a correctly formed legal document - a court order, or a warrant, or somesuch - and ask you to serve a malformed client to some cryptocat users.  This malformed client will give the impression of encrypted communication, but will actually allow the law enforcement officers full access to the plain text (but only for the specified users).  What do you do?<p>This is the Hushmail attack, and it seems like Cryptocat is vulnerable to it. Cryptocat is a browser plugin. You need to download it like everything else. The source code is on Github.<p>I swear upon my father's grave I will never do something so dishonest and evil towards everyone who has supported Cryptocat, the most meaningful thing I have made with my life. Unfortunately, I don't think you have a choice in these cases, I think you are obligated by law to do it. You always have a choice.  In this case, you can refuse and go through the legal system.  If you've made that choice already, then you can further raise a big stink about it and hope public pressure forces the gov't to back down. Oh, interesting, I didn't know that. Thanks for clarifying. Except he's distributing his client via the Google Chrome Web Store, so if law enforcement had a way of requesting that a particular user's software be backdoor-ed [1], they'd go to Google, which would also be significantly less likely to engage in civil disobedience.<p>1. I'm not a lawyer, but I'd be surprised if this were legal. Ask the law enforcement officers to send you a pull request instead? You are handling things exceptionally well under the circumstances. If anything, I find it incredulous how eminently sensible you are being. You have my respect.<p>Some people are fanatics who will never believe. Perhaps there wasn't enough hacking in terminals with falling green letters or he doesn't think crypto software can possibly be easy for non-security professionals.<p>Again, you are doing the right thing. I'm only sorry the only thing I can give you is my support. your original product was riddled with problems, so much so you had to entirely change the architecture. a stream of ppl popped out of the woodwork and had a laundry list of problems with your original work. making security products that are not built properly endangers those who use it, as i am sure you have heard many times before.<p>you are clearly very talented with marketing yourself and the project, so cryptocat getting lots of media coverage led to an essentially crowdsourced design for cryptocat 2, very similar to mega. sure enough, this design has held up relatively well and gotten through audits without too many serious issues. as someone who cares a lot about secure comms, i have seen and continue to see no reason to use cryptocat.<p>i find it particularly ridiculous that a supposed proponent of free speech suggest i am not entitled to my (negative) opinion of your project. i see no point in filing bug reports for software i will never use. i believe in people doing their own homework, it is not my job to improve your project.<p>if i assume that your govt troubles are indeed legitimate, there are a couple things that seem inconsistent to me:<p>- you seem very concerned about the negative ramifications of angering your local govt, and all this is linked to (1) your dev work and (2) your prominence in the media. if you are so truly concerned about govt action against you, why are you publicizing the harrassment you have experienced? it only serves to promote your dev work and elevate your media presence, which i would expect to further aggravate your local govt.<p>- the govt likely knows that actions like this, properly publicized, only lead to an <i>increase</i> in the reach and use of your product, in direct contradiction to your suggestion that they don't want to have your product circulate. it seems that \"cui bono\" in the context of your story is that you and your project directly benefit by getting lots of publicity.<p>i found it a bit difficult to fish out details on the ciphers and modes you use with cryptocat 2, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. i am not a fan of using a stream cipher (AES-CTR) to protect non-streaming comms due to the nonce re-use issues your audit found. ssh using AES-CTR makes sense to me, an IM protocol, not so much. You can be critical without being outright hostile. If this is how you would phrase your criticism to magikarp's face, you are not very courteous. So what would you recommend people to you for secure communications? They can't help it, friend. :-) It's what the human brain does. I think a statement like that needs a little more in the way of support.<p>Cryptocat has been fairly well reviewed by a number of fairly smart people. While flaws have certainly been found, they've mostly been addressed, AFAIK.<p>\"Snake oil\" has been a popular term to throw around ever since the original PGP user's guide, but simply labeling something \"snake oil\" without any actual proof is a dangerous thing to do (especially when it's an open source product, and you should be able to point to any defects specifically).<p>Edit: I realize the term 'snake oil' predates PGP, I was referring to the crypto community's penchant for it. Snake-oil?  I am not sure I would go that far.  I am somewhat concerned about crypto that runs in-browser after the Hushmail debacle, but the term \"snake-oil\" is usually reserved for cryptosystems that follow proprietary designs or \"roll your own crypto,\" and cryptocat does not seem to fall into either category. The fact that he's young, brilliant, and identifies as a hacktivist make it more feasible. He's a future threat. That's how the US has treated its hackers since ... the beginning. And that's why the Chinese are almost certainly eating our crypto-lunch. You'd almost think the authorities are compelled to help CN. I have spent a fair bit of time discussing Cryptocat with Nadim in person. He is sincere in his development goals for Cryptocat and does not intend for it to be a honeypot. &#62;i know the author (nadim) is in here and this is all a bit fantastic.<p>What aspect seems \"fantastic\" to you? Have you yourself been involved in activism? It just seems exceptionally incompetently handled. The inconsistent stories? Repeated connection attempts to send data to \"obvious\" places instead of more careful probes and innocent looking transmission attempts to less suspicious locations.<p>The whole thing sounds like a bad b-movie or someone playing a practical joke, rather than a genuine attempt.<p>Then again, who knows, idiots manage to get hired everywhere. from my own personal experience, govt folks like to follow. the business of knowing usually doesn't involve overt intimidation that is demonstrable to outside parties. &#62;govt folks like to follow<p>Do you mean trailing people and surveillance? <p><pre><code>  I have to wonder what you'd see\n  If you used style as ID.\n\n  Styles change from time to time\n  But style stays from line to line.\n\n  Names can change and faces too\n  But writing tells you who is who.[0]\n\n  Many say they are a crowd\n  But fewer do once lost their shroud.\n\n  Traps and snares one will find\n  Many more if kept their wits about their mind\n\n  Still plenty that you see\n  Hide their face behind IP.\n</code></pre>\nJust a thought.<p>[0]: <a href=\"http://33bits.org/2012/02/20/is-writing-style-sufficient-to-deanonymize-material-posted-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://33bits.org/2012/02/20/is-writing-style-sufficient-to-...</a><p>[1]: EDIT: It seems to me that it is very possible that not all accounts here, though not necessarily in this thread, correspond to a single individual. Could you... elaborate more on this, perhaps? Sure. While I don't want to start a witch hunt, I often wonder while reading discussions who it is behind the handle. To the point where I can't help but think that a little careful observation might uncover an army of sockpuppets.<p>With the help of the HN api, you could probably fingerprint a lot of users. Is it possible that they may have used a type of hardware backdoor? Something that would be connected to the router, or back of the computer using the lan or usb port?<p>None of that would show up in any logs or files, and it would get around any password protection and encryption on the actual computer, the only evidence would be from monitoring router traffic. A usb bug would be something that would transmit via wifi, but it would need to be connected directly to your computer to work.<p>Also check inside the computer for anything unusual.

Also love the photo of said bunker.<p><a href=\"https://blog.crypto.cat/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Port_sn_05.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.crypto.cat/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Port_sn_0...</a> Upon visiting that blog.crypto.cat URL, Chrome tells me \"Incorrect certificate for host / Error 150 (net::ERR_SSL_PINNED_KEY_NOT_IN_CERT_CHAIN): The server's certificate appears to be a forgery.\"<p>The main crypto.cat page loads fine over HTTPS (certificate has sha1 thumbprint ‎d1aa1c1037202e359f224e407d7f84a0e8a94dd7 which i see is advertised on the erroring blog.crypto.cat page).<p>Why has the certificate changed? Why did the CA signing the SSL certificate change? Is there any forwarding message signed by the original certificate? It's a bug in the Chrome 25 Beta. Will be fixed on stable release. en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Pionen The Wikipedia article notes that the press attention garnered by Nadim after his prior tussles increased the popularity of Cyptocat. Now imagine an intelligence agency wanting people to make greater use of a system they have back-doored or which is vulnerable to attack by them. Perhaps they couldn't resist the urge to make Cryptocat more popular! (Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of Cryptocat or CSIS, and my comment is hypothetical speculation. Alternative hypotheses are that they are invading Nadim's computer to try to find a way to break Cryptocat or to spook its developer, or because they have Nadim under some sort of surveillance, for who knows what reason.)<p>I do have a question about the story though. Why would an intelligence agency want to \"acquire\" Cryptocat? What would that mean anyway? Purchasing it for internal use is surely not necessary. They can just use it or any one of a number of in-house products they surely already have access to. Purchasing it to take it out of circulation is a possibility. But is this actually feasible? It's Open Source. Purchasing it to stop the developer working on it is a possibility. But wouldn't others step up? Buying a controlling stake in it is a possibility. But I don't see why an intelligence agency would make an offer of cash to someone not known to be susceptible to that kind of manipulation. I actually just don't see them doing this full stop. They surely know Nadim is motivated by idealism, not cash. So I can't think of a reason to \"acquire\" Cryptocat that actually stacks up. To work out what is going on here, you have to put yourself into the mindset of the individuals and organisations involved. And that is not easy if you simply have their media persona to go by.<p>Like the rest of the population, these organisations tend to be filled with people of many different persuasions, from geeks and activists and hackers through ultra-authoritarians and rogue elements. It's impossible to know which group is responsible for this, or what their motivations might be. It might have even been an unauthorised operation! And it may just as easily have been someone spoofing CSIS, e.g. some hacker group angry at CSIS for some past grievance. If so, I bet it is baking CSIS's noodle just as much as Nadim's!<p>At any rate, one should never infer a conspiracy where simple administrative or bureaucratic incompetence is a perfectly valid explanation. This sounds a bit like your friends are playing a prank on you, or CSIS is smart enough to make it look like that is the case.<p>The key here is your desktop and how did they access it. You should attempt to contact the Canadian Civil Liberties Association as soon as possible and protect the evidence on your laptop with your life. That'd have been an awesome trolling opportunity. This is the most trouble a browser plugin could ever cause anyone, and if all this is true then the Canadian government, the FBI and whomever else are after this kid are being very silly. That being said I can't help but think the author likes the media attention, and why wouldn't he, it must be bringing more exposure to his work. I think it's more of the sense of the passion that he puts into his work, you should read the weblog. Update found via Nadim Kobeissi's Twitter feed on Feb 11 @ 7:37 AM:<p>\"Alleged CSIS Liaison Officer met me for coffee yesterday. Told me that Cryptocat is national security threat to Canada.

That is way better oversight over executive branch spying than in the US! I suggest you contact the CSIS and ask them directly why they've backdoored your computer.

Any extra info except i found a backdoor and noticed funny traffic would be more than useful to know. whatever you do make sure to document every single little detail, take photos, videos, audio recording, keep the emails, etc... try a different computer for example android / linux or something exotic much harder to backdoor compared to windows Umm, backup and format you computer? you should revise your TCP connections if you want know if it's a joke or not Canada has secret agents? &#62; Canada has secret agents?<p>The fact that you don't know about them means ... the plan is working.

Nice piece of sarcasm, there. There are no false statements in the above. I&#x27;d give you an upvote, but I&#x27;ve been so nice to you already. Do you really deserve it, they way you&#x27;ve treated me? I&#x27;m just a copper after all. I wouldn&#x27;t know one end of an ID from the other. You&#x27;ll have to take it up with our supervisor. i have no idea what you are trying to say. It&#x27;s a poke in the eye directed at those statists and others who for years have been beating up on anyone who publicly acknowledged the possibility of any gov&#x27;t conspiracy; usually by making comparisons to absurd examples, then sometimes claiming such things are normal or just, and or making false or illogical justifications. There are real conspiracy theorists out there who are batsh*t crazy, it is quite difficult to tell which ones are actually reasonable. The illogical fallacious arguments are spewed from both sides of the debate.<p>Also, its possible to be a statist who is disgusted with the government&#x27;s behavior; its not black and white as the libertarians would try to convince everyone is the case (the NSA is spying us...and we have to pay taxes!). Ya, some of us are pragmatic.<p>So without a better alternative, we are free to shake our finger at the gov without advocating violent revolution or even deep systematic change. The devil you know...<p>Of course, living in China gives me quite a different perspective on it all. The US could definitely do much worse, and it is important to stop going in that direction. &gt;There are real conspiracy theorists out there who are batsh_t crazy,<p>Yeah, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they all are.<p>&gt; it is quite difficult to tell which ones are actually reasonable.<p>Isn&#x27;t that the truth. I used to work with a fellow who was absolutely paranoid about gov&#x27;t surveillance. Some people might think he was a lunatic off his medication if you got him started talking about it. He was an Air Force avionics tech in the 1970&#x27;s. Everything he ever told me about gov&#x27;t surveillance has turned out to be true.<p>&gt; The illogical fallacious arguments are spewed from both sides of the debate.<p>That happens at the extents of every political faction. Look at the debate surrounding Abortion&#x2F;Gay Marriage&#x2F;Drugs&#x2F;Welfare<p>&gt;Also, its possible to be a statist who is disgusted with the government&#x27;s behavior;<p>I never considered that. I should have though. I can see no reason why someone who would identify as a Statist would be any different than a person from any other political faction. We&#x27;re all people.<p>&gt; its not black and white as the libertarians would try to convince everyone is the case (the NSA is spying us...and we have to pay taxes!). Ya, some of us are pragmatic.<p>I&#x27;d be a Libertarian if I thought it could work. And be fair, there are a lot of different folks in that particular faction too. IMO, those Johnny-come-lately post Koch Bros. Libertarians don&#x27;t really count.<p>&gt;So without a better alternative, we are free to shake our finger at the gov without advocating violent revolution or even deep systematic change. The devil you know...<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re getting at.<p>&gt;Of course, living in China gives me quite a different perspective on it all.<p>It <i>does</i> give one a different perspective. I lived there in &#x27;08 &amp; &#x27;09 (though not full time).<p>&gt;The US could definitely do much worse, and it is important to stop going in that direction.<p>I have a feeling it could be a _lot_ worse in the US, but that&#x27;s no reason to accept the status quo. IMO acceptance of the status quo practically guarantees a pretty terrible outcome. It&#x27;s ^W^W^W, not ^H^H^H. Are you sure? I&#x27;m happy to be corrected if I am missing something. I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t know the origin of this convention; but I don&#x27;t understand how the caret code for &quot;End Transmission Block&quot; makes more sense than the one for &quot;Backspace&quot;.<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_control_code_chart\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ASCII#ASCII_control_code_chart</a> The Backspace key had the same scan code as Control-H, so ^H is what you would see when you typed Backspace on a misconfigured TTY (instead of it deleting the previous character).<p>Control-W is what you use to delete the previous <i>word</i> (Edit: word, not character), so ^W is what you would have seen on TTYs&#x2F;Editors that didn&#x27;t support that command. Control-w deletes the previous word in Bash and in vi insert mode. I believe, at least in Linux, the canonical line disipline also does ctrl-w.  Pretty sure that behaviour isn&#x27;t POSIX though. Control-W for ‘delete word’ entered Unix in BSD 4.x, along with changing to ^U for line erase (Bell Labs used ^X), ^R for refresh (consensus has reverted to ^L), and ^T for status (which Linux annoyingly <i>still</i> doesn&#x27;t have). These came from Tenex &#x2F; TOPS-20, which also had a fancy command completion scheme whose vestiges can be seen in ftp(1) as well as Cicso gear.<p>Job control (with ^Z and ^Y) entered at the same time. At least Linux&#x2F;SysV saw the usefulness of <i>that</i>.... Ah, excellent!  Good to know that it is more ubiquitous than I suspected.<p>(The lack of ^T on Linux really annoys me too.  What is worse is that it isn&#x27;t just a matter of the line discipline sending SIGINFO for ^T... because Linux doesn&#x27;t have SIGINFO at all.  Means you can&#x27;t even really hack up a pty wrapper program that emulates it, unless you are willing to have everything use a different signal in lieu of SIGINFO...) TIL ... NERDS!!!! Secrecy in law enforcement is problematic, but the secrecy here is less pervasive than you imply. The crimes people are being charged with here are public. The trials are public. Critically, the evidence is all public, and the chain of custody of all evidence in these cases appears to be public as well.<p>Instead, what&#x27;s alleged here is that the DEA is provided with enough information from intercepts to &quot;always be in the right place at the right time&quot;.<p>This kind of evidence --- legit evidence traceable to illegit sources --- would be excluded if it involved torture, but apparently the jurisprudence hasn&#x27;t caught up to its use in unlawful surveillance. There&#x27;s something a bit unsettling about the future when you discover that drug offenders have lately been tracked down and charged by the same means used for terrorists. But let&#x27;s talk about the present. Would you find the scenario below possible in this context and, if so, somewhat worrying:<p>1. There&#x27;s nothing that special about drug crimes. It&#x27;s reasonable to suspect other enforcement agencies are plugged into the NSA databases as well.<p>2. Let&#x27;s say that, through complete surveillance of his communications, the Anti-X agency discovers that John Smith has probably committed crime X. However, there is no other way to obtain evidence on the matter.<p>3. As many people in this country, John Smith also happens to be a drug offender. Anti-X arranges for the DEA to be at precisely the right spot and time where the offense occurs.<p>4. John Smith is now in jail for interrogation, and there&#x27;s a search warrant for his home to (also) look for the evidence that Anti-X was missing before. I agree completely, there have been many articles written on how Americans break laws all the time without knowing it (No, I&#x27;m not saying that buying&#x2F;selling&#x2F;doing drugs falls into this umbrella) and the government cannot possibly prosecute everyone from every crime. This allows the government to pick and choose who they prosecute. Lets imagine the following scenario which is very similar to the one above.<p>1. Person P smokes marijuana by themselves, doesn&#x27;t sell, doesn&#x27;t buy large amounts, &quot;Personal Use&quot;\n2. 3-letter-agency ABC is pretty sure person P smokes through some text&#x2F;call&#x2F;email&#x2F;web browsing&#x2F;etc but has bigger fish to fry\n3. Person P is an outspoken critic of government G (or just a supporter of something government G is not a fan of)\n4. Government G runs a search on person P through their database and find that ABC is 85% sure this person smokes marijuana\n5. Government G tips off local police that they might just want to stop person P&#x27;s car on X date\n6. Person P is now either imprisoned which will greatly hamper their efforts or scared into shutting up and keeping their head down<p>Now let smoking marijuana be swapped out for some other crime, something that &quot;everybody does&quot;, like downloading a song&#x2F;movie&#x2F;app, or maybe it&#x27;s even more minor but they decide to &quot;Make an example of you&quot;. The example zeteo gave is very good but most people can write it off with &quot;Well he WAS committing a crime&quot; but if the end goal of the first stop (the &quot;Foot in the door&quot;) was actually to censor the person then I think people would see more of an issue. this is what i find wonderful about tptacek hair splitting posts - they lead discussion away from the main issue - illegal surveillance in this case - to minutae details like whether Stasi power to fight drug crimes can be [ab]used to fight other crimes. I agree, and the prospects for a sturdier pipeline between NSA and the DOJ is I think a good reason to ratchet programs like this way back.<p>(I&#x27;m less disquieted by the idea of DEA being at the right place at the right time; if that was the only implication of this program, I might be less bothered by it.) I wonder what argument could be made for having any communication whatsoever between the two areas--how often does the DOJ deal with folks outside of the US, for example, thus &quot;justifying&quot; the use of NSA data sources. Al Capone was arrested, tried, and jailed for tax evasion rather than all of the much more series crimes he committed. This approach to law enforcement has been going on for long time now, sometimes with good outcomes. I think the problem now is that (a) it&#x27;s gotten much easier, (b) because it&#x27;s easy it&#x27;s being used more often for less serious crimes, and (c) it&#x27;s being used to protect the power of the powerful rather than to protect the populace. It was mostly because he was clever. He hired people that were loyal to do the killing&#x2F;etc. So those people commited the crimes, and plead guilty every time they were caught. Al Capone could not be guilty of a crime someone else committed.<p>technically, the only place where he miscalculated was tax. so they got him for that. they didn&#x27;t plant false tax evidence on him, as the NSA&#x2F;FBI did recently with that guy that refused to join PRISM with google and others. I can see in principle why this isn&#x27;t really justice. But in the example you gave, I have a hard time siding with John Smith.<p>Anti-X was able to indict him because they found evidence by using another agency - this seems intuitive and useful because they could not have ordinarily found it. If he genuinely committed the crime, they&#x27;re not obstructing justice or even his privacy here, they&#x27;re just being creative.<p>Strictly speaking, I don&#x27;t really mind that agencies in the United States can do that, because it opens avenues to evidence they would not otherwise have. What I <i>would</i> mind is if law enforcement decided they could find admissible evidence by deliberately retrieving and opportunistically analyzing <i>inadmissible evidence</i> as a springboard.<p>I understand that those two can seem really similar, but I honestly believe the latter case is a much more serious violation - it just seems like a much more slippery slope to me. &gt;I have a hard time siding with John Smith.<p>In principle, I don&#x27;t care about John Smith[1] and I wouldn&#x27;t advocate solely for the lawbreaker&#x27;s sake. I&#x27;m advocating for innocent people whose rights are violated. Now, if this scheme were directed against a different class of criminal like theiving bankers or corrupt policemen; I&#x27;d feel better about the result, but not much. Along those lines, it is offensive to imagine that our supposed inalienable rights are discarded for something as pedestrian as drug offenses when it is clearly possible for some violent crimes to be stopped[2]. Note that I am not an advocate for that. But IMO it is an added insult that we&#x27;re here living a version of Orwell&#x27;s nightmare, having just begun to suffer its abuses, but because of the priorities of gov&#x27;t don&#x27;t receive the benefit of pervasive gov&#x27;t protection.<p>On the ZOMG! slippery-slope angle, imagine just how abusive and corrupt an individual or small group of gov&#x27;t agents can be when they are allowed to conceal so much of an investigation. One person, or a small group can completely frame an individual for a crime with relatively little opportunity for the accused to defend themselves.<p>[1] Personally, I am an advocate from drug legalization, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.<p>[2] James Bamford alludes to the notion that NSA folk have had to observe some pretty terrible things in the course of duty. I don&#x27;t envy them for it. That &quot;avenue to evidence&quot; that has been opened is illegal dragnet surveillance. I think I&#x27;d feel ok if they used these tactics in the SEC. <i>After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as &quot;parallel construction.&quot;</i><p>How do you reconcile this allegation with your statement that &quot;the evidence is all public&quot; and the &quot;chain of custody of all evidence&quot; is public? It appears that what is being described is a secret, shadow set of evidence, that in fact is not made public in any way, shape, or form. You&#x27;ve misread the Reuters story. These cases start with &quot;tips&quot; based on excludable intelligence, but the DEA then diligently works to build evidence that isn&#x27;t excludable. The excludable intelligence allows the DEA to &quot;always be at the right place at the right time&quot;, but isn&#x27;t (for instance) used as probably cause to effect searches.<p>(I still think this kind of evidence gathering should still be excludable, as it no doubt would if the root of the investigation was torture and not foreign intelligence). He didn&#x27;t misread the story at all, what on earth are you talking about? The government is hiding the initial evidence. That means it&#x27;s &quot;not public&quot;. You are wrong.<p>No one but you thinks it&#x27;s OK to start investigations with &quot;tips&quot; based on excludable evidence. The rest of us literally consider that something we are protected from by the Bill of Rights. Investigations handled according to the excerpts in the article are precisely what we consider to be disgusting and evil.<p>Most of us do not support the government trying to find loopholes in the Bill of Rights. We want the government to follow the constitution not only technically, but in spirit. None of this is responsive to any point I made. Not only that, but your comment misrepresents all the points I made, for instance by asserting directly that I support the program. It is thus hard to find anything to respond to in it. You claimed he misread the story. He did not. The government is using illegal evidence as probable cause and then lying and saying something else is probable cause. That is, the real probable cause, the thing that actually turned them on to these suspects, is made &quot;not public&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t get much more &quot;responsive&quot; than that.<p>Yes, I see that you claim to not support the program. It&#x27;s hard to tell with how vigorously you are defending indefensible aspects of the program and seem to support parts of it on legalistic grounds when the issues at stake are legal AND moral. You continue to parse the posted article in an odd way that gives huge benefits of the doubt to the government when it would appear to deserve none. You don&#x27;t understand the point I was making, or have seized on a part of the conversation where there&#x27;s enough ambiguity that it&#x27;s easy to jump in and generate faux outrage about.<p>Meanwhile, your comment is yet another instance† of someone not being satisfied that we agree that the program is bad, but instead demanding that we find it bad for exactly the same set of reasons. Again: case in point for why HN is a terrible venue for political discussions.<p>Incidentally, you might do better than &quot;yes, I see that you <i>claim</i> not to support the program&quot; [em: mine] when in effect admitting that you were not only wrong, but wrong in the entire premise of your response to me.<p>† <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6160951\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6160951</a> I&#x27;m not sure the point you were making was entirely clear. Having read the article, and your replies, I don&#x27;t see how the original poster misread the article.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that I don&#x27;t understand the situation. Could you rephrase the reason you believe the original poster was wrong? i.e. That the evidence trail is public. Again: the &quot;evidence&quot; gleaned from tip-offs from unlawful surveillance can&#x27;t be introduced into court <i>in any fashion</i>; for instance, it can&#x27;t be the stated cause of a search, which must still be justified from first-principles by some defensible claim of probable cause.<p>It&#x27;s a shadow, secret set of <i>facts</i>, but it isn&#x27;t evidence and can&#x27;t be used as such.<p>And, to be clear: I think the program is bad news and don&#x27;t support it. But my reasons are probably different from those of many other HN readers, and have more to do with precedent (I think if we&#x27;re going to do extensive foreign SIGINT --- and, sorry, we just <i>are going to do that</i> --- we should at least firewall it off from domestic law enforcement). Suppose we take it to the logical extreme:<p>1. Monitor absolutely everything\n2. Place yourself in the right place\n3. Book people for what you&#x27;re able to stop them for<p>Isn&#x27;t there some law or legal doctrine that prevents this sort of police omniscience? Everyone is guilty of some infraction.<p>In other word, doesn&#x27;t the law require that police show what led them to stop a person, not that the stop was legal according to one condition.<p>It seems like the real probable cause is being hidden.<p>I don&#x27;t actually know the answer to this, it&#x27;s a serious question. The police had every reason to stop you:  you failed to signal a turn (or you did not come to a complete stop at a stop sign, or you were speeding, or any number of other violations).<p>The real problem here is that there are <i>far too many laws</i>, which has led to a situation where the police can find a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to arrest&#x2F;search anyone.  There is also the matter of victimless crimes (like possession of certain drugs), which can turn minor infractions like speeding into 20-year prison sentences.  The massive increase in police budgets and power over the past few decades added fuel to the fire, but we were in trouble from the beginning. But the point you keep missing is that you&#x27;re placing trust in an entity which is accountable to no one. No, I haven&#x27;t done that at all. &gt;I think if we&#x27;re going to do extensive foreign SIGINT --- and, sorry, we just are going to do that --- we should at least firewall it off from domestic law enforcement<p>A personal question, sorry: legality and constitutionality aside, are you comfortable with ample surveillance of other countries? If so, why? From your posts on HN since the PRISM leaks, you&#x27;ve stressed NSA&#x27;s mandate to spy on other countries. NSA exists and has this function, yes, but why is it acceptable for the US to spy on all foreigners? Yes, I am, for a bunch of reasons, not worth going into here. The simplest response to this would be that broad surveillance  of US citizens violates our Constitution, but surveillance of foreigners abroad does not. It appears that you&#x27;re happy to take the DEA informant at his word when he says &quot;Pull over suspect X on Tuesday at location Y and get probable cause for a search for drugs&quot; But obviously, there is no check on the power of the NSA&#x2F;DEA&#x2F;etc. here; and that makes the scheme as unconstitutional as anything that ever was, and ripe for abuse. One need not even don their tinfoil hat and allege made-up conspiracies[1], just consider the effect that selective enforcement with a racial bias would have, and then remember that minorities can&#x27;t even get equitable treatment for the terms of their mortgages, and that most DEA&#x2F;NSA types are socially conservative Whitey Whiterson types. Decades of this would give you feedback effects that might make people feel justified in their racial bias, and indeed there are people who argue in favor of racial profiling on the basis of the ratio of black:white &amp;etc. prison inmates.<p>[1] Like John DeLorean, Angela Garmley, or those few moron terrorist&#x2F;pizza deliverymen. What are you talking about? No I&#x27;m not. Please explain at what point the accused is allowed an opportunity to face &amp; challenge the original accusation of wrongdoing (the secret accusation that was obtained by illegal surveillance). The state is accusing you of a crime, and you have the right to confront the prosecutor. You can confront any witnesses brought against you. You do not have the right, and never have had the right, to confront every single person in the state who had ever heard about your case. You do not, for instance, get to summon the President or even your state governor to testify in your cases.<p>Once again: the information generated from this program <i>does not generate evidence</i>. It generates intelligence.<p>There is an evidentiary issue involved in the program, which is that it might generate exculpatory facts that the defended might want to introduce into evidence, which the defendant should have the right to discover. But that&#x27;s (a) going to happen very infrequently and (b) isn&#x27;t close to the biggest problem with the program, which, for the nth time today, I don&#x27;t support either. The sophistry isn&#x27;t needed. If an NSA agent provides intel for use against a person in a criminal proceeding, he should have to explain his methodology, and the details of how the intel was obtained.<p>Consider this. Ptacek rents a car to travel from A to B. NSA&#x2F;DEA&#x2F;SOD tips off DPS officers to search Ptacek&#x27;s car for drugs. Of course, they find drugs. At trial Ptacek&#x27;s defense is &quot;What drugs? I don&#x27;t know anything about any drugs!&quot; All the judge, prosecutor, defense knows is that you were pulled over, and you [consented, or PC was otherwise obtained] and lots of drugs were found.<p>Now, if the origin of the intel hadn&#x27;t been concealed, Ptacek&#x27;s defense atty could subpoena President Obama, sorry, I mean the SOD agent, who could testify as to the source of the intel. It might be discovered that there was no evidence to suggest that Ptacek was aware of the drugs concealed in his rental car. It might even be further discovered that hiding drugs in people&#x27;s car without their knowledge is one of many ways that drug smugglers move contraband.<p>You completely miss the point of what it means to have a right to face one&#x27;s accuser. You&#x27;re confusing discovery with confrontation. The discovery problem with this program has been acknowledged <i>ad nauseam</i> already. &gt; No one but you thinks it&#x27;s OK to start investigations with &quot;tips&quot; based on excludable evidence.<p>That&#x27;s a massive overstatement, as can be seen by noting that there is virtually no controversy over the anonymous tip hotlines that have been used for decades by virtually every police force in the country. From what I gather in this explanation, if the DEA has unusable evidence, they can still springboard it to finding evidence that <i>would</i> be admissible in court? Is that true?<p>So, effectively, despite the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, there isn&#x27;t real, persistent transparency going back more than a step or two in the evidence gathering process. It&#x27;s more like judging immediate evidence on its own, without questioning the steps that lead up to its (otherwise valid) finding? Yes. It&#x27;s a grey area. I happen to think it&#x27;s on the black end of the spectrum. But it&#x27;s not literally black; they&#x27;re not introducing secret evidence, or even using secret evidence as the probable cause basis to effect searches. It&#x27;s beside the point to be talking about fruit of the poisonous tree because it would never even come up at a trial - as far as the defense knows, the investigation started with a traffic stop.  They don&#x27;t know the true reason for the stop so they can&#x27;t challenge its constitutionality.<p>In fact, secret evidence <i>is</i> used as the probable cause basis to effect searches, but the government is playing a neat trick where instead of admitting it&#x27;s secret, they&#x27;re just substituting the secret evidence with some innocuous basis for a traffic stop (&quot;driving erratically&quot;, &quot;changing lanes without indicating&quot;, etc.) that in reality never would have come up if not for the secret evidence. Secret information is <i>motivating</i> the search, in the same sense as a bias against African Americans could <i>motivate</i> a similar search, but the actual probable cause that forms the basis for the search --- the from-first-principles reason for the search --- can&#x27;t be that secret information.<p>I agree that not informing the accused of the application of secret information is one of the multiple problems with this program, which just to be clear I do not support. Not in the same sense. From the article:<p><pre><code>    A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who \n    received such tips from SOD described the process. &quot;You&#x27;d be \n    told only, ‘Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look\n    for a certain vehicle.&#x27; And so we&#x27;d alert the state police to find \n    an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search\n    it,&quot; the agent said.\n</code></pre>\nThey are stopping vehicles with the only probable cause being an illegally obtained tip and then they are hiding the illegally obtained tip. The car still must be stopped for some lawful reason (speeding, broken tail light, &amp;c) and the pivot from traffic stop to car search must still be based on some articulable probable cause that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> secret information; for instance, drugs in plain site, or arrest warrant. Those sources of &#x27;probable cause&#x27; are trivial to credibly fake without consequences when you&#x27;ve got the strong tip (and already lying about the true reason for your suspicion).<p>The car &quot;drifted&quot; or &quot;failed to signal a lane change&quot; or &quot;failed to maintain a safe following distance&quot; or &quot;moved suspiciously as the patrol-car neared&quot;.<p>The officer &quot;smelled something&quot;. The driver was &quot;acting weird&quot;, or had &quot;bleary eyes&quot; or &quot;droopy eyelids&quot;. A drug dog smelled something (which could just be (a) the dog didn&#x27;t but the officer says it did; (b) the dog follows a subverbal cue from the officer; (c) the dog reacts to traces planted by the officer.)<p>Once the actual search succeeds, the flimsiest fabricated &quot;probable cause&quot; that was &quot;parallel-constructed&quot; will pass muster. So the defense that such searches &quot;must still be based&quot; on something legitimate isn&#x27;t very convincing. Once you&#x27;ve already been coached to cover-up the true source of information, what&#x27;s one more &quot;white lie&quot; to catch a &quot;really bad guy&quot;? <i>Explosive- and drug-sniffing dogs&#x27; performance is affected by their handlers&#x27; beliefs<p>UC Davis study finds detection dogs may exhibit the &quot;Clever Hans&quot; effect</i><p><a href=\"http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/2010-2011/02/20110223_drug_dogs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;features&#x2F;2010-2011&#x2F;02&#x2F;2...</a> If that was true, then we&#x27;d all be searched at every traffic stop, and there would be no point to the (excellent) ACLU videos on what to do if you&#x27;re stopped by a police officer.<p>But in reality, the sources of PC sufficient to search a car aren&#x27;t all that easy to credibly fake. Can they be faked? Certainly. Trivially? With the possible exception of drug dogs (which bother me a lot more than this program does), no. That such police subterfuge can&#x27;t be used for bulk dragnets where &quot;we&#x27;d all be searched&quot; is irrelevant: there, it&#x27;d be obvious (when the followup search usually fails) that some fishy overreach is happening.<p>In this particular surveillance-tipped condition, you are asserting there&#x27;s still some useful check from the necessity of &quot;articulable probable cause&quot;. But because of the strong (and legally out-of-band) tip, very few searches are necessary, the searches always succeed in finding contraband, and the only contrary witness to the flimsy smell&#x2F;dog&#x2F;eyes&#x2F;joint-on-the-seat probable-cause rationale is the suspect himself -- whose credibility is shot by the successful find.<p>That&#x27;s what makes the phony &#x27;probable cause&#x27; tricks trivial <i>in these cases</i>, and your reassurances hollow.<p>And once the authorities have started down the road of deception of the courts to get a conviction, it&#x27;s only a small additional step to planting the drugs&#x2F;guns&#x2F;porn. &quot;The NSA&#x2F;DEA-SOD has assured us this is a very bad guy, but all the evidence of that is non-admissible. So let&#x27;s just &#x27;parallel construct&#x27; another incriminating scene from what&#x27;s handy.&quot; It isn&#x27;t necessary to credibly fake PC, though it <i>is</i> easy (see link above). An officer could believe they were correct in their suspicion and their actions would have that bias. Combine that with a mindset of &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; and there is little that would stop many officers from an outright lie in order to achieve their goal. The officer can believe whatever they want, but if they can&#x27;t document in court the actual probable cause that generated the  search, the evidence from that search is excluded. Probable cause is not as simple as &quot;the officer says they believed the motorist was probably guilty&quot;. &gt;Probable cause is not as simple as &quot;the officer says they believed the motorist was probably guilty&quot;.<p>That is naive. The bar for documentation is the officer&#x27;s own recollection or a written report based upon their recollection. Officers receive training on how to obtain PC, and how to subsequently pivot to full searches. SCOTUS has granted wide latitude WRT such techniques.<p><i>State vehicle codes are written to provide law enforcement officers ample opportunity to establish probable cause to initiate a traffic stop when an individual is suspected of having committed, or about to commit, a crime other than the infraction of the vehicle code.</i><p><a href=\"http://www.lawofficer.com/article/magazine-feature/probable-cause-trumps-pretext\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lawofficer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;magazine-feature&#x2F;probable-...</a> You&#x27;ve confused the cause required to initiate a traffic stop with the cause required to search the contents of the car. They are not the same. I&#x27;m not confused. I&#x27;m trying to explain to you that the distinction you make between the two is practically meaningless. Even a dim-witted cop can figure out a way to get in your car for a search; you don&#x27;t stand a chance against a competent one. Right. A good counter to this would probably be requiring law enforcement to submit a report of all evidence, admissible and inadmissible, with a report of how it was found.<p>If that&#x27;s done, the only obstacle left would be corruption and deliberate lack of fidelity (a big only, but still an improvement). Does this not fall under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine?<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree</a> Hopefully, but maybe not:<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=6160671\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;edit?id=6160671</a> It&#x27;s like &quot;solving&quot; the odd-numbered problems with the help of the textbook&#x27;s answer key. <i>&quot;The trials are public.&quot;</i><p>Actually, there mostly are no trials at all.<p>As the article states, <i>&quot;most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial&quot;</i><p>One has to wonder if a &quot;justice system&quot; in which the majority of convicts have never even had a trial is worthy of the name. I find wildly erratic punitive sentencing for accused offenders who choose to go to trial alarming.<p>But I&#x27;m not alarmed that the majority of offenders plea out.<p>Trials are enormously expensive, and, in a coldly rational statistical sense, most of the accused are in fact guilty --- the fact patterns in many of these cases and the evidence supporting them are very straightforward. That there would be some incentive for the accused to spare the system the expense of litigation doesn&#x27;t bother me, especially because the more resources get freed up from pointless controversies, the more resources are available to handle meaningful ones.<p>So, I think we agree that there&#x27;s a problem, but not what its causes are.<p>Either way: plea out or not, these cases don&#x27;t get brought without &quot;untainted&quot; evidence. The problem is that the DOJ&#x27;s definition of &quot;untainted&quot; is subtly broken. &quot;Fruit of a poisonous tree&quot; is a good Google search to follow up on this. Whether it goes to trial or not, whether the evidence is untainted or not, the primary problem with the war on drugs is the extrajudicial punishment system that is seizure of property on mere suspicion.  Giving the DEA tips is paramount to simply declaring that anybody you dislike is no longer part of American society - and there&#x27;s very little recourse, just as with the no-fly list.<p>I&#x27;m still not sure how it has come to pass that Americans simply blithely accept all this. This comment mixes up too many issues (the war on drugs, civil asset forfeiture, the DEA intelligence program from today, the no-fly list) for me to respond to. Some of these programs are much more problematic than others, and they&#x27;re not actually all related.<p>If you wanted to find a quick way to synthesize a dispute where none needed to exist, taking a shotgun to the whole of American criminal justice would be one way to accomplish that. Huh. I hadn&#x27;t thought to be accused of manufacturing a dispute, and I note that you seem to have done just fine responding.<p>I suppose my point was that there is an underlying cause here, of encroaching authoritarianism in American jurisprudence that I find both alarming and surprising, but if you feel threatened by that, then by all means feel free not to take it as delivered to your address. &gt; the war on drugs, civil asset forfeiture, the DEA intelligence program from today, the no-fly list<p>They&#x27;re all related. They&#x27;re all policies and actions of overly zealous bureaucrats with too much power and little to no accountability. They&#x27;re not related. For instance, the problem with civil asset forfeiture is financial incentives; the problem with the war on drugs was a single major public policy error, &amp;c. They&#x27;re related in their origin.<p>If 4 different terror operations were coming from Al Qaeda affiliated cells, we&#x27;d say they were all Al Qaeda related. If 4 different drug dealers were busted that were all being supplied by one source, we&#x27;d call it a drug ring.<p>All of the operations mentioned -  the war on drugs, civil asset forfeiture, the DEA intelligence program from today, the TSA - are a ring of government operatives that are terrorizing, robbing and imprisoning Americans. Asset forfeiture can make it impossible to hire a competent defense atty, investigators, experts, etc. &gt; in a coldly rational statistical sense, most of the accused are in fact guilty<p>Without a trial, how do we know that?<p>If I am accused of something terrible, of which I am innocent, but a plea bargain gets me back to my family in N years instead of Never (or 10*N), I&#x27;m likely to lie and plead guilty.  We&#x27;ve seen that the government doesn&#x27;t merely use plea bargaining as a cost reduction tool, but rather as a very large hammer with which to ensure that people get punished in extreme ways.<p>While there are good police and prosecutors, as a system they are driven to increase convictions rather than to find the _guilty_. Given the chance, they can find something to convict nearly anyone of, and guilty verdicts can be nearly guaranteed against even people who are innocent by heaping up enough charges that either defense is too expensive or the penalty of losing at trial too large. You absolutely don&#x27;t know that someone is likely to be guilty in any <i>specific</i> case. It&#x27;s a statistical, macro-lens point. In a coldly rational sense, the shape of the legal system contributes to the cultural context that informs the future actions of the courts and their apparatus.<p>True, if primary cause isn&#x27;t challenged the legal system doesn&#x27;t consider antecedents as evidence; but the courts only make decisions - they have no input into the <i>consequences</i> of those decisions, other than the making of them. I am not advocating that people look at the entire justice system through a lens of cold rationalism, but projecting a single observation through that lens. I&#x27;m not disagreeing with your observation - just making one of my own. I happen to think they&#x27;re mutually informative. In many countries you cannot plea out. Everything has to reach court, and I as living in one of these countries think is a good think. This prevents extortion and bullying by prosecutors. Your sentence should not depend on your skills at negotiation and knowledge of judicial processes. What are some of those countries? Let&#x27;s be specific and see if we can generate an apples-apples comparison. I know for sure Sweden but I think most civil law countries lack the concept of a plea bargain, which means most of world. For example France introduced limited plea bargains first in 2004.<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain#Use_in_civil_law_countries\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plea_bargain#Use_in_civil_law_...</a><p>Edit: Seems a bunch of civil law countries have introduce plea bargains the last 15 years, but before that almost none of them had it. This makes it a bit hard to find a concrete list of examples since almost all hits are about the countries introducing it with little discussion about why some countries do not do the same. The DOJ&#x27;s definition isn&#x27;t &quot;subtly&quot; broken. It is completely a willful attempt to circumvent established law and precedent with a very convoluted trail of reasoning. Also not sure if this is really DOJ&#x27;s definition, or certain branches of law enforcement. There is a very subtle, insidious problem with this:<p>The fact is that this is a psyop - an operation used to legitimize the NSA dragnet in the minds of the world. They are &quot;revealing&quot; this issue to show how they are using the NSA data to &quot;catch the baddy&quot; - so therefore this program has value, RIGHT?<p>Its too late. This has gone too far. The United States of America is no longer united - it is &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot;; it is the people vs the government in that the government is literally tracking everything everyone does. You cannot have freedom under those terms. They are mutually exclusive.<p>America is officially a police state, though it has been unofficially a police state for a long time. The only observation this comment makes --- that use of foreign intelligence to help make domestic criminal cases helps validate the intelligence programs --- is blatantly wrong. I think you missed the rather insightful point he was making entirely.<p>The DEA&#x27;s use of NSA intercepts &quot;sounds&quot; a whole lot more sensible (catching &#x27;drug dealers&#x27;) than what may be potentially 1000s of other horrific uses the government is also using this data for. It absolutely does not sound more sensible for the USG to be focusing the tools of foreign intelligence on its own citizens for drug enforcement. I didn&#x27;t miss his point; his point is wrong. Using foreign intelligence for criminal justice does the opposite of legitimizing foreign intelligence programs. Where are you getting &quot;foreign intelligence&quot; from, not only in the article - but in relation to what I am talking about?<p>&gt;<i></i><i>a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.</i><i></i><p>So how is my point wrong? This is trying to prove that the secret use of NSA data to catch baddies is an important function of the program. Important? Maybe. Legitimate? No. Legitim-<i>izing</i>? Absolutely not. Today&#x27;s revelations make the NSA&#x27;s programs <i>even less legitimate</i>. I don&#x27;t think you understand how propaganda works. I also think you&#x27;re an apologist. Well that&#x27;s super helpful, Sam. I think I&#x27;ve stated my opinions on this matter very clearly. I also think its pretty clear we don&#x27;t agree on these issues.<p>You have a solid grasp of what is technically being done, though I think you are less alarmed at what&#x27;s already taken place than you should be given this.<p>The NSA is completely out of control and in a position to blackmail anyone, cut off and control the entire worlds communications and subvert anything they want.<p>The NSA and the USG are simply telling everyone that we should trust them to be the good guy, just because. While the government has already proven they will torture abuse and murder people with impunity.<p>These two things are incongruous - we can&#x27;t have a political system that is proven to abuse and one that claims to be the moral good guy.<p>No matter how much we attempt to self-delude. It&#x27;s not enough for you that we agree that the program is bad. We have to agree <i>for all the right reasons</i>. This is a perfect illustration of why HN is a terrible place to discuss politics.<p>Here&#x27;s why: we have a situation where, for once, we&#x27;ve landed on the same conclusion. We got there for different reasons. Instead of looking at that as a great opportunity to learn something new from our differing perspectives, it&#x27;s something that somehow manages to piss you off. If political discussion doesn&#x27;t work here, it&#x27;s certainly not going to work anywhere else.<p>I&#x27;m not getting my wish that discussions like these simply be banned from the site, but maybe we could take a baby step towards civility by not calling people names. First, I am in no way pissed off.<p>Second, I actually really enjoy talking about these things with you on HN.<p>Third, we both get emotional about things we discuss - I recall a thread between us ~2 plus years ago where we were in heated discussion!<p>And C) - these items are political - but entirely germane to HN as the whole thing is enabled by tech and techies &quot;just following orders&quot; and tech companies &quot;just making more sales&quot;.<p>We are on a very slippery slope; nobody wants to live in danger, but everyone is in danger of government abuse with these programs. Hey, just in the interest of thwarting a false equivalence: I haven&#x27;t called you names. You have called me names, on this very thread. I&#x27;m not super offended and would still buy you a beer in person, but let&#x27;s all be clear that we&#x27;re not supposed to be doing that on HN. You were never called any names. He said you were an apologist. In reading your postings, your comments do strike me as having an overtone of apology for the surveillance state.<p>In political matters - the power of government vs. the rights of the individual - most people will fall into one of the two groups as a basic mode of operation for their perceptions and personal philosophy. When governments become tyrannical, as the US government is now proving itself to be, the contrast between the two modes becomes starkly delineated.<p>Authority vs. Liberty is an ancient human argument that is obviously still being played out. Those of us with an unbreakable attachment to Liberty will see any arguments in favor of the current regime as apologia. &quot;You were never called any names. He said you were an apologist.&quot;<p>Well there you go. Super helpful comment, tptacek This glosses over the fact that &quot;they&quot;, the government, is a hugely multi-faceted entity, the vast majority of which is benign in both purpose and operation. There is only one &quot;they&quot; that matters in this context, the ones with all the power; the NSA. Not precisely correct this bit: <i>This kind of evidence --- legit evidence traceable to illegit sources --- would be excluded if it involved torture, but apparently the jurisprudence hasn&#x27;t caught up to its use in unlawful surveillance.</i><p>Nominally private communications that are acquired without the benefit of a warrant, are excluded all the time. The notion of &#x27;parallel construction&#x27; is antithetical to the presumption of innocence clause. Any conviction where it can be shown that the initial basis for investigation was acquired in this way and the evidence history had been &quot;re-constructed&quot; in order to avoid that taint, would be thrown out by any appellate court in the country.<p>No doubt there are motions being filed right now for such actions. The crimes being committed here by the DEA are equivalent to the following:<p>- Suspect is detained and harshly interrogated, rights violated, possibly tortured.<p>- Suspect signs confession<p>- Suspect is given a drug to wipe his&#x2F;her memory of the torture&#x2F;abuses.<p>- Suspect is convicted of crime he&#x2F;she committed.<p>The specific law that is being violated is different, but the effect is the same, since one could argue that if the drug the suspect was given wiped away any memory of the mistreatment, it might as well not have occurred. Wait, what? No, it&#x27;s not like that at all. It&#x27;s bad for an entirely different reason. I agree that it&#x27;s bad for a different reason, but it&#x27;s bad in the same way. In other words, it should trigger the same &quot;ick&quot; response in our gut. Honestly, you haven&#x27;t presented a logical argument, or even a persuasive emotional one. The goal of my comment was to present an emotional argument analog, not to create the best execution of that emotional argument. Wouldn&#x27;t there be evidence that doesn&#x27;t ever become public?<p>The idea was the NSA discovers a bunch of information about someone, then gives the DEA tips on where to look for evidence of lawbreaking. That way evidence <i>is</i> secret, because when the time comes to share evidence, the DEA has only looked in places to find inculpatory evidence. The superset of all evidence discovered remains &#x27;off the record&#x27; with the NSA, and out of the hands of the defense. No. The DEA knows things under this program, but deliberately does not introduce those things as evidence.<p>(One concern from this article that doesn&#x27;t ring true to me, but maybe someone else can expand on, is the likelihood that this information is exculpatory). If the information that they are acting on is closely linked to evidence of entrapment; or the sorts of grooming and radicalising tactics that the FBI has been known to use to create &quot;domestic terrorists&quot; from angry young men.<p>Then it damn well is exculpatory. What rational person would argue that it was <i>impossible</i> for there to be secret exculpatory evidence in intelligence intercepts? That wasn&#x27;t at all my point. How does chain of evidence work in this case?  If ill-gotten information leads to the discovery of evidence, does that poison the evidence?<p>Like if I tap a drug dealer&#x27;s phone illegally, find out he&#x27;s making a deal tonight at 8p, and &quot;happen&quot; to be there when the deal occurs, can the deal itself be entered into evidence, or no? It &quot;should&quot; make the evidence excludable, but might not. Again, do some reading --- especially, if you can find them, law school articles --- on &quot;Fruit of a poisonous tree&quot;.<p>Most obvious exception: if the actual introduced evidence comes from a drug deal that is done in plain site, where the accused is arrested with the money from a hand to hand or somesuch --- unlawful surveillance or not, the evidence from that arrest might not be excludable. &gt; but apparently the jurisprudence hasn&#x27;t caught up to its use in unlawful surveillance.<p>How is that possible? Surely evidence that is obtained that is derived from an illegal search is inadmissible. I think (repeating another comment) you&#x27;ve misread the Reuters story:<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6160632\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6160632</a> I haven&#x27;t I was pointing out, as I see others already have, that the evidence in the subsequent search is tainted. But it seems there might be some technicalities for why it is not. Police in my country have an agreement with the DEA so no warrants are needed at all. The courts in my country are difficult for the cops to snow with BS so instead they use US courts. The police here use illegal no warrant searches and surveillance that courts here throw out, so they have the local DEA office kidnap the suspect and delivered to the US through extraordinary rendition.<p>Now police provide this illegally obtained evidence which is admissible in the less strict US court. Because they are looking at 100+ yrs prison sentence if they go to trial they always plead out because defense lawyers in the US tell them it&#x27;s impossible to get evidence thrown out from UK, Canada or French police. It&#x27;s a tidy arrangement, use the US as the world court to avoid annoying warrants. These are always conspiracy cases where no actual drugs are involved just bugged conversations, informants and emails This is <i>exactly</i> the nightmare scenario we were fearing - and lo and behold, it has already happened: using mass spying data of the NSA to launch fishing expeditions against Americans, and find them guilty of crimes.<p>You could say &quot;yeah but that data can&#x27;t be used in Court!&quot;. But they can very <i>trivially</i> skirt around that. They don&#x27;t have to use <i>that data</i>. They just need to use some of that data to show a judge &quot;probable cause&quot; - and BAM: now they have a warrant to <i>legally</i> get access to anyone&#x27;s data, and <i>that data</i> they can use.<p>But in practice such process by the authorities makes the &quot;limit&quot; of a warrant essentially useless. The warrant just becomes an extra beaurocratic step that they have to take, but doesn&#x27;t represent a limit on who they can investigate and how anymore. <i>Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come from foreign governments, U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal, tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller&#x27;s citizenship can be verified, according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.</i><p>Sounds like a pretty big limitation to me. The operative word being &quot;generally&quot;. Political limitations are worthless. If they have the capability, they will abuse it. We already know they don&#x27;t care about the constitution and that they have secret interpretations of laws. Ignorance of the law and imagination can get you pretty far.<p>Lets be frank here, Political limitations are the only thing stopping government agencies from shooting Laser Microphones half-a-mile away listening to your entire house. (4th Amendment, Illegal Search) You have no idea of the abuses that can be possible with law enforcement equipment, and are probably just scared of a little bit of the possibilities or powers afforded to them.<p>Keep your wits about you, this can get much much worse before it may get better. And hyperbole now will only harm your argument in the long run.<p>Reality is, intelligence agencies are under DoD. They aren&#x27;t supposed to be investigating Americans, period. If they manage to nab information about American People (which includes legal immigrants btw), they are not allowed to forward it to law enforcement.<p>We know that anything pulled out of the NSA system is recorded and checked by the FISA courts, to ensure that Americans were not part of the targets. (Edward Snowden admitted it himself, although he wanted more than just 5% random checks on this log). &quot;Lets be frank here, Political limitations are the only thing stopping government agencies from shooting Laser Microphones half-a-mile away listening to your entire house.

You mean that it&#x27;s &quot;usually&quot; and &quot;generally&quot; a limitation, right? <i>After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as &quot;parallel construction.&quot;</i><p>Jesus fucking Christ.  They were lying to prosecutors to get charges pressed against people. They weren&#x27;t necessarily lying, -just omitting the cause prior to the traffic violation. If the traffic violation as primary cause was never challenged, they wouldn&#x27;t technically be taking a position on the origin often. They&#x27;d simply state the facts: &quot;Vehicle X was driving southbound on I-94 and failed to utilize a turn signal while switching lanes. I pulled car over and noticed x,y,z...&quot;<p>As a police officer friend of mine told me many years ago &quot;If I want to pull you over, there is nothing you can do to stop me. All I have to do is follow you for one mile and you&#x27;re going to violate <i>some</i> portion of the traffic code.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not defending this <i>at all</i>, as I think it is outrageous and that the link to harvested NSA data is <i>beyond the pale</i> . I&#x27;m just pointing out that this is, as the article mentioned, de rigueur, and when a technically legal starting point is provided, the defense likely almost never challenges that, thus eliminating the need for the prosecution to take a formal stance on the origin. Hopefully this begins to change. <i>They weren&#x27;t necessarily lying, -just omitting the cause prior to the traffic violation.</i><p>You seriously need to read this:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree</a><p><i>Fruit of the poisonous tree is a legal metaphor in the United States used to describe evidence that is obtained illegally.[1] The logic of the terminology is that if the source of the evidence or evidence itself (the &quot;tree&quot;) is tainted, then anything gained from it (the &quot;fruit&quot;) is tainted as well...Such evidence is not generally admissible in court.</i><p>You cannot conceal the source of evidence that leads you to other evidence. I think (and hope) you&#x27;re right that this is a straightforward application of the poisonous tree doctrine, but you should be aware that the doctrine is not quite a clean-cut as you make it out to be. One big exception to it is &quot;inevitable disclosure&quot;. If a traffic stop is otherwise lawful, and a normal police officer acting in the lawful confines of their authority would have otherwise discovered e.g. the drug stash in the car (for instance, because it was in plain site in the back seat), the Poisonous Tree doctrine probably doesn&#x27;t exclude the evidence.<p>That&#x27;s the tricky thing about the Reuters DEA revelation. Some drug offenders probably are cavalier about displaying evidence in the cars because the likelihood of their being stopped is low. Here, domestic surveillance is allowing the police to drastically increase the odds that they&#x27;ll make a fortuitous traffic stop.<p>What would <i>not</i> work, in my understanding of the story, is for an intelligence intercept to establish the legal basis for stopping and searching a car. I completely understand the technical distinction, however I find the argument hypertechnical and completely violating the spirit of the law.<p>Honestly seems like the whole point of SOD is to get around the poison fruit guideline. I agree, it really seems like they&#x27;re trying to come as close to the line as they can without obviously crossing it, and I think it&#x27;s clear they did cross it.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t see any virtue to secrecy in this case; unlike organized Al Qaeda terrorism prevention or foreign hostile adversaries or counterproliferation, the tactics we&#x27;re using in the &quot;war on drugs&quot; are a public policy matter that benefit from public discussion. <i>That&#x27;s the tricky thing about the Reuters DEA revelation. Some drug offenders probably are cavalier about displaying evidence in the cars because the likelihood of their being stopped is low.</i><p>Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t even matter if the drugs were in plain sight? The cop could likely just use the old &quot;I smell marijuana&quot; trick and then he would &#x27;inevitably discover&#x27; the drug dealer&#x27;s stash, no matter where in the car it&#x27;s hidden. I think you mean &quot;inevitable discovery.&quot; Thank you for the link 300bps.<p>Edit: So this seems to speak to a bit of what the main link was talking about. This extension of the exclusionary rule doesn&#x27;t speak to whether or not omission of first cause is lying (under the legal definition), but rather about how if the first cause evidence was obtained illegally, then it cannot be used.<p>The crux of this issue seems to be that the prosecution is not volunteering information that might trigger the defense to look for Fruit of the Poisonous Tree in the first place (and does that cross the line into illegality, thus preventing evaluation).

When the prosecutor pressed for more information, he said, a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.&quot; Isn&#x27;t it perjury, a free pass to the jail? According to articles that I&#x27;ve read in the past, when the Feds get caught in trial doing something like this, they&#x27;ll say &quot;Whoops, we screwed up, but we were acting in good faith&quot;. Generally, that makes it ok. Nobody goes to jail when the DEA&#x27;s soldiers invade the homes of innocent people and kill them.  Why would they go to jail for perjury? Not if you&#x27;re on Team State. Sounds like Viktor Bout and all the other cases that they were able to get convictions on will surely be overturned shortly. At some point people need to wake up enough such that they recognize the equivalence of being surprised and being naive, which is an important reason they&#x27;ve trusted government to its own devices for far too long. <p><pre><code>  First they came for the communists,\n  and I didn&#x27;t speak out because I wasn&#x27;t a communist.\n\n  Then they came for the trade unionists,\n  and I didn&#x27;t speak out because I wasn&#x27;t a trade unionist.\n\n  Then they came for the Jews,\n  and I didn&#x27;t speak out because I wasn&#x27;t a Jew.\n\n  Then they came for me,\n  and there was no one left to speak for me.\n\n</code></pre>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came%2E%2E%2E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_they_came%2E%2E%2E</a> We rightly vilify the Third Reich, but the lesson of history is not that the Nazis were intrinsically evil; it&#x27;s that any culture has the capacity to normalize and systematize its own unique brand of evil, via a thousand baby steps.<p>Just because America is not and never will be Nazi Germany, that&#x27;s no reason to accept or ignore the American flavor of fascism that has been quietly brewing for decades. I highly recommend this documentary on the Gestopo:<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtgB4qiiWBI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LtgB4qiiWBI</a><p>The first thing the Nazis started doing when they got power was set up a secret investigative unit. Where they started creating detailed records of all of their enemy targets (starting w&#x2F; the communists and the competing political party). This intelligence was then used by the SS&#x2F;SA to harass, round up and assassinate anyone who was a threat to their power.<p>The intelligence agencies were the foundation of Nazi fascism. The signs of power abuses were present in these agencies <i>way</i> before the Gestopo became publicly infamous for targeting Jews. I&#x27;ve very much come to hate Godwin&#x27;s Law. There are important lessons, perhaps the most important, to draw from that dark time of history, and we won&#x27;t see them if we insist that the comparisons are only apt if every little thing is exactly the same, or as 100% evil as the Nazis. There should have been far more attention paid to the specific comparisons of the Patriot Act to pre-conditions of Nazi Germany, rather than getting distracted by &quot;BUSH=HITLER LOL&quot;. Just a couple of days ago somebody on HN speculated this was happening, and I dismissed it as paranoia. Surely nobody is going to risk revealing the existence of a universal surveillance program over a few drug convictions, right? Twenty-eight of you agreed with me. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6134821\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6134821</a><p>I give up. Apparently no speculation is out of bounds any more. If someone says it&#x27;s all due to Nazi reptoids, I&#x27;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt. I&#x27;ve had similar experiences about many things I used to think  were paranoid becoming provable fact. However the other day the news about the google search for back packs and pressure cookers I thought was completely false and it was.<p>What I&#x27;ve realized is that the things I thought were paranoid and came true are things that I thought were paranoid because I had &quot;trust&quot; in various organizations not to abuse power, not because the actions seemed out right implausible.<p>With the backpacks and pressure cookers story, I was skeptical not because I trusted the fbi, but because it seemed implausible given the way the fbi typically acts and strongly against their interests.<p>So my updated rule is that &#x27;trust&#x27; is no longer a valid reason to rule something out as paranoid. This is an ethos that the security world has long held as obvious, that many technical people formerly not particularly interested in security are waking up to. &quot;There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.&quot;<p>-John Adams I thought it wouldn&#x27;t happen for <i>cynical</i> reasons. I assumed that government agencies would want to guard their powers jealously, and given the potent justification of national security, the NSA could easily do so.<p>Also, because they&#x27;re smart people who understand the danger of revealing their programs to too many people.<p>Maybe I misjudge how many favors bureaucracies are willing to do for one another.<p>Or perhaps the higher-ups in the NSA are true believers in the drug war. I guess I&#x27;m not and I assume people in the NSA wouldn&#x27;t be either.<p>That said, I think I&#x27;ve made it abundantly clear that nobody should listen to my speculations. This program apparently predates the post-9&#x2F;11 NSA programs, and we don&#x27;t know that any of the intelligence generated from i.e. the wholesale capture of Verizon&#x27;s call database under &quot;business records&quot; exemptions in PATRIOT fed the program at all. We still don&#x27;t know that much about this particular program. This is a far bigger story than PRISM or XKEYSCORE. Both described databases compiled through known processes (FAA orders and fiber taps) and used for terrorism and foreign intelligence investigations -- not domestic criminal investigations.<p>The Reuters report today shows significant abuse of intelligence intercepts that should make all of us angry.<p>The NSA has been allowed to assemble its vast intelligence-gathering apparatus on the theory that terrorists and foreign spies do not have Fourth Amendment rights, and the executive&#x27;s power to conduct surveillance is at its height when non-Americans are the focus. Now we&#x27;ve learned that the Feds have engaged in a bait and switch maneuver: databases are collected on the &quot;terror spies&quot; pretext, and then they&#x27;re used for domestic criminal prosecutions. This is very dangerous.<p>It also shows that the Supreme Court justices who blessed the NSA&#x27;s FAA intercepts in February 2013 were fare too optimistic. They said if the Feds used NSA intercepts to bring domestic criminal prosecutions, they &quot;would be required to make a disclosure&quot;:\n<a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1025_ihdj.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;12pdf&#x2F;11-1025_ihdj.pdf</a><p>FYI here&#x27;s my article from last month on how the DEA&#x27;s Special Operations Division, cited in today&#x27;s Reuters piece, does e-mail wiretaps:\n<a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57593538-38/how-the-u.s-forces-net-firms-to-cooperate-on-surveillance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.cnet.com&#x2F;8301-13578_3-57593538-38&#x2F;how-the-u.s-fo...</a> Greenwald now discussing it live here: <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.democracynow.org&#x2F;</a><p>Edit 1: Has ended, will post a link when in archive.<p>Edit 2: The interview starts at 18:00 and a direct link to the MP4 file is <a href=\"http://dncdn.dvlabs.com/ipod/dn2013-0805.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dncdn.dvlabs.com&#x2F;ipod&#x2F;dn2013-0805.mp4</a><p>Edit 3: Starting 43:15 pertains to DEA SOD After hearing all of this stuff, I feel like the television show The Wire was either way ahead of its time or had really great law enforcement consultants. I&#x27;m leaning toward the latter. Before David Simon created The Wire he was a reporter on the Baltimore Sun, covering the crime desk. He somehow managed to convince the Baltimore PD to embed him in the homicide department for a year. Ed Burns (who co-wrote a lot of the series) used to work as a Baltimore PD detective, and the technical advisor for the first two seasons was a Baltimore police commander.<p>A <i>lot</i> of the plots on The Wire are based on actual cases and occurrences. In some cases quite loosely, in others not so much. It&#x27;s a depressingly realistic show. <a href=\"http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-real-people-that-inspired-characters-on-the-wire.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;10-real-...</a> The director was a 12 year journalist for the Baltimore Sun: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Simon\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;David_Simon</a><p>Ed Burns worked 20 years in BPD in the homicide and narcotics divisions, then became a school teacher: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Burns\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ed_Burns</a> A government that hides its actions is a government that is overstepping its bounds and needs to be slapped around a bit.

What a wonderful way to run the &quot;land of the free&quot;<p>I bet most people thought the spying was for terrorists. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again.<p>The USA is a tyranny, there is nothing you can do about these things. One of the principal mechanisms used in the USA to maintain its system of oligarchy &#x2F; tyranny is distraction of the population via &quot;culture war&quot; issues and identity politics.<p>As long as people vote based on who they&#x27;d rather have a beer with, or based on issues like homosexuality and religion, they will <i>not</i> vote based on issues of social justice, economic well being, or against the politics of corruption.<p>The culture war and identity politics are a classic divide and conquer technique. It&#x27;s used because it works. I&#x27;ve long thought this, but never read someone say it so starkly. My heart dropped with every sentence.<p>Any suggested reading? Culture war plus culture of entertainment.<p>I note the above digression in this thread -- which incidentally is higher upvoted than the present thread -- wherein people marvel at how similar the recent abuses are to the plot of the TV show &quot;The Wire&quot;.<p>Tune in next week! Until then, tune out. &gt;there is nothing you can do about these things.\nIt&#x27;s gonna take generations of work to resolve it, but there&#x27;s absolutely a way out of this. We may never find it, though. I agree with your first statement, yet we have many avenues open to us still before all is lost, but that window is closing fast. In light of the &quot;Three Felonies a day&quot; phenomenon, and given the sweeping nature of the surveillance, it seems likely that the number of cases that are prosecuted represents only a small fraction of the number of potential cases that could possibly be taken to trial.<p>This gives the criminal justice system considerable latitude to select and prioritise certain cases over others.<p>How are these decisions made?<p>Can we be sure that political considerations and&#x2F;or racial &#x2F; sexual &#x2F; gender biases, (conscious or unconscious) do not play a role in the decision making process? &gt; How are these decisions made?<p>When it&#x27;s convenient for the career of the person with their finger on the button.<p>&gt; Can we be sure that political considerations and&#x2F;or racial &#x2F; sexual &#x2F; gender biases, (conscious or unconscious) do not play a role in the decision making process?<p>Quite the opposite, we can be sure that they <i>do</i> play a role. When you get to pick and choose your targets, it&#x27;s a foregone conclusion that the targets you pick will be selected because of some criteria beyond the fact that they are merely in violation of the law. <i>&quot;It is one thing to create special rules for national security,&quot; Gertner said. &quot;Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.&quot;</i><p>This implicit double standard plays a role in allowing this kind of thing to happen. I wonder when we&#x27;ll start reëvaluating it? Imagine if you were listening in to communications on US citizens as part of an NSA program and you came across what appeared to be the distinct planning of a murder - one that had nothing to do with National Security now or in the future. What do you do? This is part of the interesting range of unexpected consequences when you stretch boundaries. Before the leak -- nothing probably. It would have revealed the existence of the program.<p>Now -- sure! They could just come knocking to the door. This is dark side of the leaks in way. If they know we know, they they can expand the use of the tool. (Or rather I should say this is the dark side of apathy to the information in the leaks, now they now public doesn&#x27;t care enough). The apathy is the scary part. I fear it would take a <i>mass</i> roundup of people before the &quot;we need this because of X&quot; people might start questioning it.<p>OTOH, it may be mental (illness?) for people to blindly follow authority. This is the premise of person of interest - does raise some interesting moral questions for TLA officers. Just watched full 2 seasons after recent HN recommendation. &quot;Person of Interest&quot; is a good series, and in some moments not-so-suprisingly-now scary. Isn&#x27;t this practically the plot of <i>The Conversation</i>? No. The Conversation is a private spook doing surveillance. tomato, to<i>mah</i>to -- your comment does make me wonder just how much the NSA contracts out its surveillance though.  Remember, Snowden was working for Booz Allen Hamilton, not the NSA. Words mean things. They form the basis of our laws.\nIt is <i>legal</i> for a private spook to be hired by private persons or corporations to spy on others. It is <i>illegal</i> for a spook of any flavor to be hired by the government to spy on USians without a warrant or similar device. Your last statement is really what all the fuss is about, though -- the government is trying to contravene how most sane people would interpret the Constitution, and legalize such activities. &gt; <i>&quot;As a practical matter, law enforcement agents said they usually don&#x27;t worry that SOD&#x27;s involvement will be exposed in court. That&#x27;s because most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial and therefore never request to see the evidence against them. If cases did go to trial, current and former agents said, charges were sometimes dropped to avoid the risk of exposing SOD involvement.&quot;</i><p>This is interesting, as it&#x27;s basically an admission that Aaron Swartz-style prosecutorial bullying is not limited to just computer-related cases. &gt;This is interesting, as it&#x27;s basically an admission that Aaron Swartz-style prosecutorial bullying is not limited to just computer-related cases.<p>I guess I always took it for granted that prosecutorial bullying is ever-present. It&#x27;s interesting to come face-to-face with the reality that it&#x27;s not part of everybody&#x27;s worldview that the State is &#x27;out to get you&#x27;. (no sarcasm) Here&#x27;s hoping that everyone who was convicted via this method gets their sentences overturned, because that&#x27;s about the only way this will stop. I think it is less nefarious than that - it feels more like the problems that arise from fixing bugs in code. We&#x27;ve all encountered this - you fix one bug and it breaks 3 other things, because of unexpected&#x2F;unintended consequences. Something else was relying on the broken code to work right. Systems thinking is just plain hard...<p>So how do we do unit tests for laws? Lawyers are like <i>that guy</i> in that complexity favors them and gives them job security.  Simplicity and clarity is not a virtue in law. That would be difficult: how are you going to make the case that <i>your conviction</i> is due to this method? Unlikely. &quot;Your honor, I should get a new trial because, in addition to the evidence that was apparently quite sufficient to convict me, it turns out they also had an illegal wiretap recording of me arranging the buy.&quot; So suppose this is true:<p><i>A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. &quot;You&#x27;d be told only, ‘Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.&#x27; And so we&#x27;d alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,&quot; the agent said.</i><p>How do you square that with the claim that the NSA is tracking only metadata? I&#x27;d say you need the phone call contents to know where to stop a particular truck. &gt; How do you square that with the claim that the NSA is tracking only metadata?<p>It&#x27;s horseshit. Because SOD has more investigative inputs than just the NSA, and also because they are not required to track only metadata for foreigners.<p>More mundane (and perhaps more likely) is that the source data for that kind of tip comes from wiretaps from existing open investigations. You might not get probable cause for a search based on the wiretap data alone, so SOD gets the local cops to alert on the car instead and &quot;start&quot; the follow-up investigation. yes could be an informant or a undercover cop - back in ww2 the ultra decrypts where disguised as coming from other sources.<p>You not going to tell some random cop this is from bob our inside man on the crew in case the cop is corrupt and sells out your DEA agent Suppose you had enough (meta)data on a particular user, if that user spent a disproportionate amount of time at a specific truck stop, it wouldn&#x27;t take too long to extract that from your data. Something tells me we will soon learn that the judicial branch purposely creates loopholes for the executive branch to exploit. I will literally cry myself to sleep that evening if such a thing comes to pass :( I&#x27;d start hydrating now. The next question: How come with all this, the cartels continue to exist? Because the U.S. government secretly loves to profit off of both the direct selling&#x2F;transportation&#x2F;etc of drugs and the prison industrial complex.<p>I recommend you read the following for more details and proof:<p>The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Politics-Heroin-Complicity-Global/dp/1556524838/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;The-Politics-Heroin-Complicity-Global&#x2F;...</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Politics_of_Heroin_in_Southeast_Asia\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Politics_of_Heroin_in_South...</a><p>Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Acid-Dreams-Complete-History-Sixties/dp/0802130623/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Acid-Dreams-Complete-History-Sixties&#x2F;d...</a><p>The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1595586431\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1595586431</a> Thanks for that list.<p>It feels like in a world where people were generally interested in solving the issues with the drug trade the DEA wouldn&#x27;t need to exist.

Thanks again.<p>One thing I don&#x27;t understand is what happens to the supply line the decriminalisation case. Obviously trafficking is still illegal but is still happening. I guess there&#x27;s still the same amount of money running back to the drug cartels. &quot;It feels like in a world where people were generally interested in solving the issues with the drug trade the DEA wouldn&#x27;t need to exist.&quot;<p>Drug prohibition has never really been about solving the problems society faces with drugs.  In the early days when cocaine and heroin were first made illegal, the argument was overtly racist.  Black cocaine users would be more accurate with a gun, would go into a frenzied state where they attack white women, and would be difficult to stop even when shot in the chest.  Philipino immigrants were bringing their bad opium habits with them, and heroin was marketed by a German company.  Marijuana was said to cause white women to want to have sex with black men, and good white boys were being corrupted by Mexicans who gave them marijuana.<p>In this day and age the war on drugs is not overtly racist (but it just happens to disproportionately affect black communities -- coincidence, really!), but we now have a host of new reasons for it.  Drugs are an easy way to terrify a population that grew up with war on drugs propaganda, and politicians looking for a few more votes can easily play up their &quot;tough on crime&quot; stance with drugs.  Deploying soldiers to arrest suspected drug dealers is the norm, and police forces wanted to build a paramilitary wing can always turn to drug crime as a justification for it.  Pharmaceutical companies love the war on drugs because it inflates the demand for prescription medications; a prominent example is methamphetamine, the supposed scourge that also happens to be prescribed as a treatment for narcolepsy, obesity, and ADHD (you can bet that the pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine is cleaner and purer than the stuff you buy at a truck stop).  Alcohol and tobacco companies lobby in favor of the war on drugs (ironically), for obvious reasons.<p>So really, to understand the war on drugs you just need to change your perspective.  Do not think in terms of solving the problems associated with drugs, because that is little more than a facade.  Think in terms of money and power, which are the real purpose of the war on drugs and the reason we will not see the DEA disbanded any time soon. You don&#x27;t have to go back that far for evidence that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is racist. The phrase itself was coined for Nixon&#x27;s first term, where the southern strategy was first used. In the 80ies Zurich, Switzerland had a really bad problem with Heroin addicts and the related crimes (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platzspitz_park\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Platzspitz_park</a>). The problem went away completely and instantly when the state began issuing Heroin to addicted people in a controlled environment. Now that park is back to being one of the nicest places in the city.<p>The english Wikipedia article unfortunately doesn&#x27;t talk about that program but only about &quot;... and in 1992, police moved in to clear up the park...&quot; which did clean the park but did nothing to solve the problem - the addicts and associated crime just crossed the river.<p>The only real fix for the issue was to destroy the market by just handing out the drug freely.

It&#x27;s an interesting question - you can get cocaine or heroin walking in off the street, but you need a doctor&#x27;s prescription for some Xanax or Aderall? Would everything go over the counter? Is that wise? To be honest, I don&#x27;t know. This is an interesting problem. I do know that a lot of people get hooked on Oxycotin and then turn to heroin for a variety of reasons. Though if heroin was legal it could be manufactured in a sterile environment where you could probably get like 99% purity or something ridiculous like that. It&#x27;s relatively easy to get a prescription for whatever you want. Especially in States like Florida that don&#x27;t check if you&#x27;re doctor shopping.<p>There are also legal drugs that have similar effects to things like Adderall. A lot of people don&#x27;t know about them or use them because they haven&#x27;t been researched as much and come in powder form.<p>At the very least I think that you shouldn&#x27;t be put in prison for carrying pills without a prescription.<p>You might find this Vice article interesting.

Marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, being legally able to harvest the opium from poppy seed plants, etc. <i>&gt;Though if heroin was legal it could be manufactured in a sterile environment where you could probably get like 99% purity or something ridiculous like that.</i><p>This already happens. Diamorphine (heroin) is commonly used as a painkiller in hospitals. If you&#x27;ve ever been seriously injured and wound up in hospital with a tube going into your arm attached to a button which gives you a dose of painkiller, limited to something like 3 presses an hour, then you&#x27;ve probably taken heroin, likely in large amounts. The nurse may well have called it &quot;morphine&quot; to avoid scaring you.<p>Famously, &quot;Heroin&quot; was originally a trademark of the Bayer company.<p>EDIT: apparently this is only true in the UK. This might be why we don&#x27;t have the fancy modern opiates here, oxycontin etc. You are correct. I forgot about our friends across the pond. I believe I read heroin was supposed to be a less addictive alternative of morphine. I don&#x27;t know much about opioids, I wonder what the breakdown in pricing is between commercial, hospital heroin versus something Oxycontin. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s probably cheaper to produce hospital heroin and drug companies can&#x27;t compete with it. Also consider that the US army burns the enormous afghan poppy harvest every summer while big pharma synthesises its opiate molecules at great expense. Probably a combination of the sheer volume of the drug trade <i>(you can&#x27;t catch everyone)</i> coupled with the high demands of the market <i>(busting one cartel would cause a supply &quot;vacuum&quot; that would be quickly filled)</i>. Ties directly into this:<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6154302\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6154302</a> Mind blowing lack of sense of right and wrong from govt agents who think laundering the trail of their investigation is the right thing to do. We really are living in post-constitutional USA. Wow. Hadn&#x27;t heard of this &#x27;parallel construction&#x27; stuff before, and will have to reserve judgment for now... but telling agents and investigators that they can&#x27;t so much as mention the provenance of the info to the prosecutors or the court is rather beyond the pale. <i>A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. &quot;You&#x27;d be told only, ‘Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.&#x27; And so we&#x27;d alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,&quot; the agent said.</i><p>I live near a section of a federal highway that is well known to be used for transporting drugs from New York to Vermont. For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been struck by the number of arrests that always seemed to start with a traffic stop. Given the daily traffic volume of 60-25K vehicles per day, I had always wondered how the relatively few officers covering a wide area could be so effective. The next agency I expect to hear about ... the IRS starts using this kind of data. I&#x27;d bet tomorrow&#x27;s lunch they already have. Not long before the NSA story broke in June I recall a few quickly forgotten stories about the IRS reading people&#x27;s emails without warrants, and monitoring transactions and social media to find people cheating on their taxes. Why did both the headline <i>and</i> the source article on this get changed? It was initially a link to Yahoo News and is now the Chicago Tribune. Original headline mentioned the specific allegation that the DEA was using this warrantless information to springboard investigations into previously unsuspected persons. Let&#x27;s not get too carried away.  Secrecy in law enforcement can be a valuable tool: it allows things like protection and development of informants, lawful surveillance, undercover operations, etc.<p>Prosecutors have never been required to turn over ALL evidence -- only exculpatory evidence (and that does not include evidence that might be useful in jury nullification, only evidence that would tend to prove the accused innocent of the charges).  Withholding evidence of guilt from the defence is common: it is done to protect sources and ongoing investigations or even to shorten a trial.  If you have more than enough to convict, why trot everything out?<p>The described &quot;parallel&quot; investigation is another common technique.  If you have a source of evidence you need to protect, then you develop different evidence and instead use that to secure the conviction.  Provided the evidence used is real and is sufficient to prove guilt, no laws or moral codes have been transgressed.<p>Law enforcement and prosecutors use inadmissible evidence all the time to pursue an investigation.  The point of an investigation is to secure sufficient admissible evidence to successfully convict (prove guilt of) the perpetrator.  But the rules don&#x27;t say you can&#x27;t use all the information at your disposal -- only that some of it might not be useful for you at trial.  (Full disclosure: there are, and should be, rules governing what law enforcement and other state and federal agencies can do in collecting evidence.  But disclosure of all information, evidence, and techniques to the defendant is definitely not one of them.)<p>An interesting corollary is the so-called &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; problem.  If a critical piece of evidence is deemed inadmissible, it might take with it a bunch of other evidence that was generated based upon it. Courts frequently permit the prosecution to re-introduce some of the evidence if  it can be shown that it could have (not &quot;was&quot;, &quot;could have&quot;) been developed without access to the inadmissible piece.  This is precisely the parallel development narrative described, and it is a very common tool.<p>I agree that this particular system seems well beyond the pale, but lets not pretend that suddenly getting rid of secrecy in law enforcement and removing prosecutorial discretion is a no-brainer solution.  Lets also not pretend that this isn&#x27;t a clear extension of standard practice (albeit a pretty major and troubling extension we might want to trim back a bit). There needs to be a phrase for that moment when the wholesale discarding of the law is so accepted within a government agency that it ends up embedded in a tutorial Powerpoint slide, which eventually gets leaked to the press and (hopefully) implodes the whole practice.<p>&quot;PPTerrorism&quot;? &quot;PowerPointillism?&quot;<p>Or maybe a wonderful German composite word.  <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archives.gov</a><p>lynx -dump <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archives.gov&#x2F;exhibits&#x2F;charters&#x2F;bill_of_rights_tra...</a> |sed &#x27;&#x2F;The right of the people to be secure&#x2F;,&#x2F;be seized.&#x2F;s&#x2F;   \\[ Redacted \\]&#x2F;&#x27; Off-topic, but still interesting in context of social networks as a leakage vector:<p><i>Since its inception, the SOD&#x27;s mandate has expanded to include narco-terrorism, organized crime and gangs. A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit&#x27;s annual budget. A recent _LinkedIn_ posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.</i> I was excited to see this story being broken by Reuters instead of the Guardian.  The US press have been sleeping on the job, but this article gives me hope.  I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt that the Guardian have been openly bragging about the amount of traffic they&#x27;ve gotten from covering the NSA scandal. I&#x27;ve thought about writing a program that would randomly send search queries to Google, Facebook, etc for specific keywords like pressure cooker, drug, bomb, etc. Just overwhelm them with traffic. There have been some half-serious discussions about this elsewhere.  The idea is to start flooding the web with <i>encrypted</i> traffic, which is supposedly enough of a red flag in and of itself for the NSA to consider it worth storing.  The back-of-the-napkin math predicts that if you do enough of this, they&#x27;ll be unable to store all of it.<p>Or they&#x27;ll just open a new datacenter. The data-mining aspect could be troubling depending on the details, but the parallel construction isn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re not planting the drugs on the suspects when they stop stop them. But the hysteria here is thick so one can&#x27;t even begin to have a reasonable discourse in this comment thread. The paranoid one-sidedness of the discussion is mind boggling.<p>Look at these downvotes for disagreements. There&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;ve said that warrants the downvotes. You&#x27;re arguing that breaking the fundamental principles of both law enforcement and the right to a fair trial is &quot;not troubling&quot;.<p>You have every right to do that (and nobody should downvote you for that), if you argue in favor of a much more repressive legal regime than the one we currently have in all Western democracies. But instead, you just insult people (&quot;hysteria&quot;, &quot;paranoid&quot;) who might not agree with arguments <i>you don&#x27;t even bother to present</i>. &gt; <i>&quot;But the hysteria here is thick...&quot;</i><p>This is evidence that FBI, DEA, and other agencies, at multiple levels of government, are colluding with dragnet surveillance operations. How much worse would you say it should get before it&#x27;s not &quot;paranoid?&quot; <i>There&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;ve said that warrants the downvotes.</i><p>Maybe you&#x27;re getting downvoted because you&#x27;re complaining about downvotes and not actually contributing anything to the dicussion? I did contribute something, the point that drugs are not being planted on people. The parallel construction wouldn&#x27;t work if the suspects were not actually committing crimes. Nobody wants to talk about it I guess however, too busy getting their fix on today&#x27;s outrage porn. <i>&quot;The parallel construction wouldn&#x27;t work if the suspects were not actually committing crimes.&quot;</i><p>See &quot;Three Felonies a Day&quot;[1]<p>Also, note the following quote from the original article:<p><i>&quot;most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial&quot;</i><p>In fact, something like 90% or more of people accused of crimes in the US never get a trial, because they plead guilty.  They plead guilty because prosecutors pile on so many charges that the defendants are afraid to risk life in jail if they happen to lose (in a judicial system that&#x27;s usually stacked against them).  Defending a case in Federal court is also incredibly expensive and traumatic.  See the Aaron Swartz case for good examples of all of the above.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a> The thing is, as these things come out, it turns paranoia into reality.  I preferred being paranoid, rather than correct, myself.<p>Maybe you are getting downvotes because you seem to be endorsing illegal activities by the federal authorities?  It is a crime to fail to divulge the source of evidence, or worse, outright lie about it, is it not? I am not sure it is illegal to obtain information through lying and deceit, as police do this all the time, especially if the information is not used in a trial. If there is enough &quot;clean&quot; evidence to go to trial, I am not sure there is any reason to doubt the validity of the arrest, trial or the conviction of the defendant.<p>The collection of data may be illegal, and that is worth investigating. The collection of information of data of innocent people, people with no probable cause they are committing crimes or without a warrant, is not OK. &gt; The collection of information of data of innocent people, people with no probable cause they are committing crimes or without a warrant, is not OK.<p>Aye, there&#x27;s the rub.  The collection of the trawl data invariably will uncover some crimes being committed by people who are not suspected of committing crimes.  In other words, search and seizure without probable cause.  Now it appears this illegally begotten evidence is being used to point federal law enforcement at targets.  Do you really not see a problem with this? I see a problem with collecting information without probable cause or a warrant. Though I may not agree with drug laws, I do not see the problem with convicting individuals who are committing crimes regardless of how that information was collected unless the act of collecting the information affects the information (like confessions under duress). For example I am somewhat appalled at FBI deploying malware, but I hope they do not let child pornographers walk free because of the FBI&#x27;s actions. Your arguments are not self consistent.<p>&gt;I see a problem with collecting information without probable cause or a warrant.<p>&gt;I do not see the problem with convicting individuals who are committing crimes regardless of how that information was collected...<p>The second case is not possible without making an exception to the first, which then leads to the selective application of fundamental rights and that is paradoxical.<p>Mass surveilance will undoubtedly unearth crimes that would not otherwise come under suspicion in a free society. By definition, the surveilance <i>will</i> also target those who have commmited no crimes. The question is whether that risk is worth it. The Fourth amendment says no. Making exceptions for certain classes of people (even if probable criminals) is just a slippery slope. I interpreted it as meaning that btipling does not like such information collection but as long as they&#x27;re doing it, any criminals they catch should still be prosecuted anyway. I think this is a terrible idea, but there seem to be many out there who do not consider the consequences and think that people should be put in prison regardless of any potential police actions that got them there. Do you not see the problem with allowing them to convict people based on illegal investigations? If they are allowed to use illegal methods and still get a conviction, they will continue to do so. Cases <i>should</i> be thrown out when the investigation was done illegally, as a way to strongly ensure such things do not happen. A guilty person going free is bad, but far worse is a rogue police force with no regard for the law and the good and proper limits placed upon them to prevent abuse. Well, the problem is that you can&#x27;t have a &quot;guilty people only&quot; filter on a data trawling system.  You have no idea who the guilty people are, that is why you are trawling the data.  So, I guess what you have to ask yourself, is if the fourth amendment is worth sacrificing in order to catch drug dealers.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is, and I hope most Americans agree.<p>&lt;edit&gt; replacing drug dealer with terrorist doesn&#x27;t change my view on the matter&lt;&#x2F;edit&gt; &gt; I see a problem with collecting information without probable cause or a warrant. Though I may not agree with drug laws, I do not see the problem with convicting individuals who are committing crimes regardless of how that information was collected unless the act of collecting the information affects the information (like confessions under duress).<p>You effectively contradict yourself: you can&#x27;t say &quot;no&quot;, reward them for doing it, and expect it to stop.<p>So effectively, your first sentence carries no weight, because you don&#x27;t believe in enforcing it... you believe in rewarding law enforcement for doing the exact opposite. This isn&#x27;t outrage porn, hysteria or anything else. Its simple violation of the american judicial system. Point blank period.<p>As for your downvotes, dont agree with downvoting someone just because you disagree with them. The problem with downvotes is that they&#x27;re wholly subjective.  While you may not downvote someone based on disagreeing with them, others will and can. I don&#x27;t even see that as a problem.  If we accept the use of upvotes to signal agreement, it is only natural that downvotes will come to signal the opposite. The problem is that this produces an echo chamber, the things that majority &#x27;agrees&#x27; with hits the top, and the things that folks &#x27;disagree&#x27; with sink out of site. Upvoting&#x2F;Downvoting comments shouldnt really be based on &#x27;aggreement&#x27; but instead based on &#x27;interesting&#x27;, upvoting interesting or thought provoking comments regardless of wether you agree or not leads to more interesting conversation... Using upvotes freely but downvotes sparingly produces something else (which I cannot mention by name without this comment going &#x27;dead&#x27;).  The willingness to disagree is a large part of what makes HN what it is, and I think that downvotes help foster the sort of atmosphere in which that is possible.<p>Really, contrarian viewpoints are <i>hardly</i> an endangered animal here. Natural for some. I can&#x27;t downvote [1].<p>When it comes to downvoting rights, Hacker News has the rough equivalent of a poll tax or voter ID law. ;)<p>[1]: Not yet. Depending on the reaction to my post, &quot;not yet&quot; might change into &quot;can&quot;. Or might change into, &quot;yeah, never&quot;. What a shock!",

It is the fact that those have now been made public and, indeed, posted on the Department of Justice&#x27;s Web site at www.usdoj.gov which brings me back to the Senate floor to briefly mention why I think Ms. Gorelick&#x27;s testimony is even more important to explaining what she did as a member of the Justice Department under Janet Reno to erect and buttress this wall that has been the subject of so much conversation and why it is so much more important that she do so because the 9&#x2F;11 Commission&#x27;s credibility is at stake.&quot; &gt; Also, back in that era, information sharing between CIA and FBI was not even permitted.<p>What possible reason could there be for this? Both are supposed to serve the same government, one domestic and the other foreign. What would be the negatives with sharing information with each other? One is a law enforcement agency that primarily focuses on domestic cases. It is set up to follow requirements that protect constitutional rights, with the ultimate goal being a prosecution through the justice system.<p>The other is an intelligence agency that focuses on foreign collection, analysis and action. Its activities are definitionally illegal in the places where it operates, with the ultimate goal being to inform and enforce American foreign policy using means other than the US justice system.<p>The CIA sharing information with the FBI generally means that the 4th amendment has been violated, because the CIA operates with an &quot;ends justify the means&quot; framework that the FBI isn&#x27;t supposed to use.<p>Edit: I worked with defense&#x2F;intel forensics as Iraq was transitioning from wartime (intelligence based) to peacetime (justice based) frameworks for dealing with terrorists. There is a massive difference between intelligence briefings needed in a wartime environment to prevent IEDs through &quot;kinetic action&quot; and the evidence packet needed to prosecute terrorists in court as civil society reasserts itself. I feel so uneasy with a ‘division?’ of government defined as “ends justify.” The Constitution does not exist in those halls (as evidenced), and if one assumes an limit to infinity state, many tyrannical actions could take place.<p>Do you feel that fear is misplaced? Or do we derive societal level benefit from the unfortunate things that could (and do?) occur? Different contexts require different paradigms. For example, you can&#x27;t operate in a war if you require your soldiers to arrest everyone who is shooting at them and collect evidence for an eventual trial. You also can&#x27;t operate as even a regional power (let alone a global superpower) without keeping tabs on your adversaries.<p>The difficulty is in structuring agencies that have to follow different paradigms and determining how they should interact. One key bifurcation is supposed to be that intelligence services face outward, dealing with people who don&#x27;t have constitutional protection because they are not residents or citizens.  That outward focus has gotten muddied by the focus on preventing domestic terror attacks, the reality that much of the internet&#x27;s physical infrastructure exists within our borders, and the difficulty in automatically determining the nationality of online personas. No, the CIA is one of the most evil and dangerous organizations on Earth.<p>They ran torture centers, got caught, got investigated by congress, lied under oath, then got caught hacking congressional computers to delete evidence of the lies.<p>Nobody went to jail. Worse, the 92 tapes of torture were destroyed, and the incoming Democratic president announced that there would be no torture prosecutions, even for the woman who intentionally destroyed the evidence. Gina Haspel was appointed <i>Director</i> of the CIA by his Republican successor. The list is endless. Similarly, intelligence agencies worldwide operate outside the law. Although there aren&#x27;t any ex-&quot;intelligence&quot; heads of state... well, that&#x27;s not entirely true.<p>Throughout history, those in power have often lied to those they govern, and it&#x27;s a crucial aspect of their operation.<p>However, using torture, violence, false flag operations, and being an adversary to one&#x27;s own people isn&#x27;t necessary, except when it&#x27;s deemed necessary for the &quot;greater good.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a dark rabbit hole that can shatter one&#x27;s faith in society, and even asking questions can lead you down that path. Therefore, most of us turn a blind eye to it.<p>Undermining one authority can undermine the credibility of all authority because all authority is built on faulty logic and falsehoods, despite being a necessary component of a functioning state.<p>I forgot to mention this sucks. &gt; all authority is built on faulty logic and falsehoods<p>That’s a big claim. If you’re talking about current national and state-level governments, sure, granted. But there is plenty of legitimate authority out there. It&#x27;s the state itself. Congress and other institutions are those who try to contain the state in its cage - Constitution and the Bill of Rights. If you think the CIA is one of the most evil and dangerous organizations on earth, you probably haven&#x27;t had a lot of exposure to organizations around the world.  I&#x27;m not saying their mission and means of achieving it is necessarily angelic.  I&#x27;m saying that there are hundreds or thousands of much more evil organizations in this world. It might help your case if you suggest some. Contemporary?<p>Belarusian KGB, Chinese Ministry of State Security and United Front Work Department and 610 Office, Cuban Intelligence Directorate, Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, Haitian Service d&#x27;Intelligence National (funded by the CIA), Israeli Mossad, Pakistani ISI, Myanma OCMSA, North Korean Ministry of State Security and RGB. You left out French and UK intelligence, and their long history of colonial and post-colonial fuckery.<p>Singling out the CIA is like trying to give speeding tickets to NASCAR drivers; they&#x27;re all gonna get one, the CIA is just going the fastest. The Wikipedia pages for various national intelligence organizations are hilarious concise.<p>Good retirement hobby: summarizing everything from dead tree niche books to the web. Excellent analogy, thanks. don&#x27;t forget all the Secret police agencies trained by the CIA, at the school of the America&#x27;s and the rest.<p>We are terribly lucky to have such wonderful people protecting ${ideology x} &#x2F;s I only listed contemporary examples. The constitution does exist in those environments. Lawyers and judges review plans for covert action, assessing whether it’s constitutional, authorized by congress, and in accordance with executive policy. [dead] &quot;Both are supposed to serve the same government, one domestic and the other foreign. What would be the negatives with sharing information with each other?&quot;<p>Any sufficiently large organization develops its own factions, with their own internal goals and culture, which will inevitably conflict with the other factions. The larger the organization, the more distant the factions can be from each other, and it doesn&#x27;t take all that long before they don&#x27;t even see each other as on the same side &quot;under the hood&quot; anymore, but simply as rivals.<p>The US government is way, <i>way</i> beyond the &quot;sufficiently large&quot; size, which is more down around the size of any organization that exceeds the Dunbar number. In the real world, even assuming the FBI and the CIA are themselves unitary organizations is only useful as a very rough approximation. I don&#x27;t have the info to know <i>what</i> the factions are or who they want, I just know from general principles that they are individually far beyond the size where they are most assuredly factions within them, and probably large enough that the factions have their own quite distinct factions within themselves. There are protocols for this sort of thing, so a given department takes the lead by default. On national security for example the FBI does the counter-intelligence investigations, but obviously affected agencies can, and do, decide to feed disinformation instead of allowing an arrest to proceed. This needs coordination to overcome the faction thing. I don’t know if it’s _the_ reason but a possible reason is a protection of US citizens rights. I believe that was the case. The 9&#x2F;11 Commissions Report is actually really, really well written and quite a gripping read. Highly recommended but IIRC that was the reason. And the report is freely available if you don&#x27;t want to pay for the book: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9-11commission.gov&#x2F;report&#x2F;911Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9-11commission.gov&#x2F;report&#x2F;911Report.pdf</a> I would imagine this is a large portion of it. I worked with multiple agencies in the post 9&#x2F;11 world when I was a govie. We still had a lot of limits and oversight over certain projects. The varying title authorizations exist for a reason. The good sometimes comes with the bad, that dance is delicate. Then I could understand why FBI—-&gt; CIA would be blocked, but not the other way around.<p>(If it’s indeed true that the CIA only looks at what’s going on ex-US)<p>But I doubt the two would play nice with each other if the flow was only 1-way. Let&#x27;s preface everything I say here with &quot;on paper&quot; or &quot;theoretically&quot; or &quot;in an ideal world&quot; ...<p>The FBI&#x27;s goal is to arrest people, charge them, and send them to jail.  Everything they do will be presented to the public, at trial, and examined by the opposing side and presented to a jury.  There&#x27;s not a lot of room for nuance here.  There&#x27;s also not a lot of room for secrecy.  The accused has the right to confront their accuser.<p>The CIA&#x27;s goal is to &quot;protect the nation&quot; and almost by definition deals entirely in secrets and ambiguity.  &quot;Sources and methods&quot; are some of the most closely held and valuable secrets.  &quot;A person we kinda trust, sometimes, accused someone of possibly planning to maybe do something nefarious.&quot;  -- not going to hold up well in court, even if it&#x27;s totally reasonable to now put that person on some kind of watch list (and yes, at this point, all of us are on some sort of watch list -- see the disclaimer above; we&#x27;re now at 30,000 days of the condor and counting)<p>So -- intelligence sharing between the CIA and the FBI sounds great in theory; in practice it may be tricky. The FBI uses parallel reconstruction a lot to hide how they actually became aware of a suspect. As a jailhouse lawyer it was interesting reading cases where some FBI field agent did something really technical and comparing that with the their public testimony in cases that demonstrated a lack of the technical knowledge&#x2F;capability needed make those technical jumps. I got 10 years of free legal schooling with nothing else to do but sit and read case law in my cell. Props to a fellow jailhouse lawyer. The FBI does more than prosecutions. They have a whole domestic intelligence gathering operation. Ostensibly their goal is to find criminals and arrest them and in doing so they&#x27;ll also be preventing foreign spies from spying, or domestic terrorists from domestically terroring; both of which are illegal in some way, I think. They conduct investigatory operations. It isn&#x27;t all crime related. The mundane stuff just doesn&#x27;t get featured in police procedurals. Oh yes of course; but I&#x27;m not sure the FBI would be consulting with the CIA over background checks (overtly). With the goal of investigating potential crimes. Anything they collect may show up in a public court case someday. Isn&#x27;t one of the primary reasons for the FBI counterintelligence?  I was under the impression that their other general-purpose law enforcement functions were secondary. Their primary function is law enforcement.  That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re under the Dept. of Justice, and the CIA isn&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re Super-Cops, first and foremost.<p>The CIA, NSA, etc. aren&#x27;t allowed to track domestic stuff; they&#x27;re codebreaking and&#x2F;or foreign intelligence.<p>But they sure as hell can share their tools with the FBI, who are authorized to do domestic surveillance. &gt; 30,000 days of the condor<p>Love the reference, BTW :-) I believe the CIA cannot legally operate intelligence gathering on US soil or on US citizens, them sharing info to the FBI might reveal that they did that. If the CIA accidentally collects intelligence about a US citizen’s overseas business dealings, for example, that shouldn’t be passed along to domestic law enforcement, right? I was young at the time, but my recollection is that that was my understanding back then, and it seemed sensible.  I&#x27;m not convinced it wasn&#x27;t sensible. I don&#x27;t think &quot;not even permitted&quot; is correct.<p>See for example the following, from Wikipedia&#x27;s Alfreda Bikowsky entry[1]:<p>&gt; Bikowsky was a senior staff member at the Bin Laden Issue Station in January 2000.[16] She was the direct supervisor of Michael Anne Casey, a CIA staff operations officer who was assigned to track future 9&#x2F;11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar at an al-Qaeda operatives&#x27; meeting in Malaysia in early January 2000.[9] Casey blocked a draft cable written by Doug Miller, an FBI agent detailed to the Bin Laden Issue Station, to the FBI warning that al-Mihdhar had a multiple-entry visa for travel to the U.S.[17][18]: 240  Mark Rossini, another FBI agent first assigned to the Bin Laden Issue Station in 1999,[18]: 233  testified that Casey also verbally ordered him to not share information with FBI headquarters about al-Mihdhar or Nawaf al-Hazmi, who was traveling with al-Mihdhar.[2][19] Rossini further stated that Bikowsky told congressional investigators in 2002 that she hand-delivered al-Mihdhar&#x27;s visa information to FBI headquarters. This was later proven false by FBI log books.[2] The CIA shared some details about al-Mihdhar with the FBI at that time, but not that he had a valid visa to enter the U.S.[18]: 244–7<p>This kind of story is inconsistent with the notion of a ban on information sharing between the two TLAs.<p>Of course, Bikowsky&#x27;s story, and  Ray Nowosielski and John Duffy&#x27;s documentary <i>Who Is Rich Blee</i>, in which her identity was revealed, may be relevant to the linked article in their own right.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alfreda_Frances_Bikowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alfreda_Frances_Bikowsky</a> I know that information sharing between FBI and intelligence agencies existed in the late 90&#x27;s, but the CIA was not directly part of that activity.  If you look at my links in the GP post, you will see that Clinton&#x27;s deputy AG was responsible for creating a &quot;wall&quot; between CIA &amp; FBI.  It&#x27;s easy to look at that as a bad thing with the hindsight of 9&#x2F;11, but I would rather live in a world with such a wall today vs. what we have now. How do you square that with 1) two FBI agents &quot;detailed to&quot; the CIA&#x27;s Bin Laden Issue station (&quot;Alec Station&quot;),  2) &quot;CIA shared some details about al-Mihdhar with the FBI at that time&quot;?<p>Compartmentalisation (i.e. an information &quot;wall&quot;) does not equal a total ban on information sharing, as your comment might imply, it just mandates that there are filters and checks on information channels, rather than unfettered sharing, for obvious and sensible operational reasons.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s worth quoting at length from the source[1] for Wikipedia&#x27;s statement that &quot;CIA shared some details&quot;, which has a section on CIA &#x2F; FBI information sharing:<p>&gt; 4. Passing of intelligence information by the CIA to the FBI<p>&gt; The CIA shares intelligence with the rest of the Intelligence Community through a communication known as a “TD” (“Telegraphic Dissemination”). TDs can be sent to other Intelligence Community agencies, including the FBI, and are available to the Intelligence Community through the Intelink system.<p>&gt; Another type of intelligence report used by the CIA when conducting business with other agencies is a CIR, or “Central Intelligence Report.” CIRs are used for disseminating information to a specific agency or group of agencies. CIRs to the FBI normally concern something occurring in the United States, involving a U.S. person or an ongoing FBI investigation.<p>&gt; In addition to formal methods of communicating by the CIA to the FBI, much information can be shared with the FBI informally. CIA and FBI employees who have similar positions and expertise develop relationships and communicate informally while working together on related matters, either by secure telephones or in person. In addition, meetings are sometimes held to discuss a matter or a piece of intelligence that is of value to both agencies. According to the CIA employees we interviewed, when the CIA passed intelligence information or other kinds of information verbally or by another informal mechanism to the FBI, the information exchange normally would be documented through a TD or a CIR. However, they said that not every telephone call or conversation was documented.<p>&gt; C. FBI detailees to the CIA Counterterrorist Center<p>&gt; In 1996, the FBI began detailing employees to work in the CIA’s CTC. During the time period relevant to this chapter of the report, five FBI employees were detailed to the CTC’s Usama Bin Laden Unit in four separate positions. Two of the positions were filled by personnel from the FBI’s Washington Field Office, and one position each was filled from the FBI’s New York Field Office and FBI Headquarters.<p>.. and so on ...<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oig.justice.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;special&#x2F;s0606&#x2F;final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oig.justice.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;special&#x2F;s...</a> Ironically? Because back in the day we (the US) were terrified that the CIA or the FBI, given too much liberty of information sharing, could mutate into a USSR-esque KGB, keeping an eye on foreign powers but also scanning for domestic political dissidence and connecting the dots between exterior and interior threats. It was seen as a hallmark of a police state to have citizens under the same level of scrutiny as potential foreign threats.<p>9&#x2F;11 changed a lot about how Americans perceive risk factors. The CIA, FBI, and DHS are still separate orgs, but there are now mechanisms by which they share information and the walls between domestic and foreign spying are a lot thinner. &gt; back in the day we (the US) were terrified that the CIA or the FBI, given too much liberty of information sharing, could mutate into a USSR-esque KGB, keeping an eye on foreign powers but also scanning for domestic political dissidence and connecting the dots between exterior and interior threats<p>Good thing that never happened. Unfounded fears The fear was, of course, justified, but the hard lesson learned in 9&#x2F;11 was the old engineering lesson: everything is trade-offs.<p>Once it became clear that there was a decent chance the plot could have been foiled had the various orgs not firewalled information from each other, the writing was on the wall for the old fears. New fears had displaced them. It is like that old Ben Franklin quote:<p>“Giving up a little liberty for temporary security is totally cool, no big deal.” I think that was it at least, maybe I’m a couple words off… So the irony of that quote is that most people use it as caution against government overreach.<p>In context, Franklin was talking about a plan by the Penn family to buy the right to never pay taxes in exchange for providing private mercenaries to bolster the western Pennsylvania front against native attacks. The &quot;those&quot; he was referring to <i>was</i> government... The government of the PA colony. The &quot;liberty&quot; in question was the legislature&#x27;s authority to determine how taxes should be levied. Hence the &quot;deserve neither&quot; part... &quot;Make a short-sighted decision like that, as the leaders of this government, and you don&#x27;t deserve the power vested in you.&quot; This is true, but I think the original intent of quotes (for long dead figures whose lives have been mythologized anyway) is not very important. It isn’t like we’re trying to figure out the original intent of some law or something.<p>The quote as misinterpreted is what has entered the cultural consciousness. One guy meant to say one thing, but millions gave it a timeless meaning. So it would be extremely relevant as the US government gives overt and tacit concessions to China as they are reliant on their manufacturing base for US security &#x2F; arms This wasn’t a purely hypothetical fear. Look up the findings of the Church Committee in the 1970’s regarding programs such as the CIA’s MKULTRA, the FBI’s COINTELPRO, and the NSA’s Project SHAMROCK. The FBI, and the rest of DOJ, has more constraints as to how it can collect information due to it focused on law enforcement. The CIA on the other hand is focused on gathering intelligence so does not have those same constraints. The FBI has a counterintelligence&#x2F;domestic intelligence mission alongside its law enforcement mission. Following the exposure of COINTELPRO, the FBI dialed back its presence information gathering apparatus publicly, though critics of beaueau practices maintain similar programs have persisted through the following decades. Either way, 9&#x2F;11 offered a chance to reinstate some of the FBI&#x27;s old power and influence. Yes, but that was curtailed due to abuses during&#x2F;against the civil rights movement.  It started coming back with Waco &amp; the Oklahoma City bombing and then roared back after 9&#x2F;11. That they persecute using their law enforcement powers. The CIA operates using different powers, they don&#x27;t need a warrant to surveil a subject for instance It turns out that in practice, you only need a warrant if your endgame is to prosecute and convict people in court. The FBI’s methods have historically <i>included</i> criminal prosecution, but are not restricted to it. Yeah, their involvement in the assassination of Fred Hampton and blackmail&#x2F;suicidal encouragement of MLK Jr. makes this pretty clear.<p>I&#x27;m sure if some brave activists were to rob the correct field office (which is the only reason we ever found out about COINTELPRO) today, they&#x27;d find similar evidence for the murders of Darren Seals and other BLM figures.<p>&gt; Two other men connected to the protests, Darren Seals, 29; and Deandre Joshua, 20, were found killed under similar circumstances. Joshua was found dead in a torched car in November 2014 during the Ferguson protests. Two years later, Seals was found dead in a torched car after having been shot.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollingstone.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;culture-news&#x2F;ferguson-death-mystery-black-lives-matter-michael-brown-809407&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollingstone.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;culture-news&#x2F;ferguson-d...</a> Counterterrorism&#x2F;counterintelligence <i>is</i> law enforcement (terrorism &amp; spying against the US is a crime), and it is FBI’s primary mission. Because it’s completely untrue. People could actually read the memo rather than repeat Ascroft’s and institutionsl lawyers attempt to blame another admin&#x2F;party for 9&#x2F;11:<p>“We believe that it is prudent to establish a set of instructions that will more clearly separate the counterintelligence investigation from the more limited, but continued, criminal investigations. These procedures, which go beyond what is legally required, will prevent any risk of creating an unwarranted appearance that FISA is being used to avoid procedural safeguards which would apply in a criminal investigation.”<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalsecurity.org&#x2F;security&#x2F;library&#x2F;report&#x2F;2004&#x2F;doj-911-supplementarymaterial.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalsecurity.org&#x2F;security&#x2F;library&#x2F;report&#x2F;2004&#x2F;...</a><p>Which should make all of HN’s sing, but easier to repeat the “wall” meme.<p>The CIA wanted to recruit, the agencies don’t play together, and when they get caught with their pants down it’s blame someone else.

In exchange, they&#x27;re given a lot of slack with regards to their extrajudicial&#x2F;unconstitutional activities. Slack in their respect for the law is not a desirable characteristic in your law enforcement agencies. CIA is a surveillance organization with no significant restrictions on what they do outside the US, including on US citizens. FBI is an internal law enforcement agency (ostensibly) limited by american civil protections and due process.<p>If you take the organizations at face value by stated mission, it makes sense that the CIA would have a tremendous amount of information on US citizens that would be proscribed for the FBI. Allowing shared access is just asking for parallel construction and secret courts and shit. Because a domestic covert spying agency is a secret government. See the Stasi, or the Church Committee hearings, or the Iran-Contra hearings.<p>A domestic spy agency would spend all of its time trying to control government, strategic industries, and self-dealing. There are no checks on an organization like the CIA other than the old limitation that it couldn&#x27;t target US citizens. There&#x27;s no way to oversee an agency that isn&#x27;t obligated to explain itself to Congress, is supplied by secret budgets, and information on whose outputs is protected by the Espionage Act (or ultimately, indefinite imprisonment and torture, threats made to family members, etc.)<p>We&#x27;re sacrificing democracy for a secret hierarchy of secret police. You&#x27;ve cut government completely out of the equation if you have a government department with the latitude and ability to control domestic politics. It&#x27;s basically a military coup. This was before the CIA and FBI were given a path for cooperation under the newly created DHS.<p>See the second link above (added after your comment, sorry.) I guess there is a lot of context missing for me, as I&#x27;m not super well-read when it comes to the interdealings of US government agencies.<p>Could you maybe give a short summary of the reasons for the restriction of information sharing between the FBI and CIA? In the pre-9&#x2F;11 era, one way of protecting domestic citizens against secret-police style spying was a literal hard firewall between the legally domestic FBI and legally international CIA.<p>Also, police agencies tend to be fiercely territorial about their jurisdiction and this rivalry was no exception. Historically, CIA was supposed to be doing international intelligence gathering things while the FBI was more along the lines of the federal government&#x27;s domestic crime investigation unit. CIA never really had to care about privacy rights because their targets were practically always foreign nationals not protected by the US Constitution. The FBI was almost exclusively operating domestically where Constitutional rights are practically always in effect. Just putting a note here that whether or not foreign nationals are subject to the protections of the Constitution is a contentious issue.<p>IANAL, but in many places the Constitution specifically calls out citizens vs non-citizens and in other places does not make an explicit distinction. The bill of rights is one place it doesn&#x27;t explicitly specify, and indeed uses language that elsewhere was used to indicate it applying to citizens and non-citizens. Of course that interpretation fell away during the cold war and is less popular now. 2nd Am is throwing a wrench in this &quot;where Constitutional rights are^H^H^H^H were practically always in effect.&quot;<p>The &quot;Patriot Act&quot; (which was supposed to be temporary) has permanently eroded those rights. The Patriot Act expired in 2020, and many of its provisions were overturned by court rulings. &gt; The Patriot Act was written with “sunset” provisions requiring Congress to re-authorize the program every few years. Although the Act expired in March, 2020 without being reauthorized, federal law enforcement agencies retain most of the authorities granted by the act. The surveillance infrastructure that the Patriot Act created exists to this day. The Patriot Act is a prominent example of the use of terrorism to justify expanding government surveillance.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epic.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;surveillance-oversight&#x2F;patriot-act&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epic.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;surveillance-oversight&#x2F;patriot-act&#x2F;</a> &gt; Although the Act expired in March, 2020 without being reauthorized, federal law enforcement agencies retain most of the authorities granted by the act.<p>By what statute do they maintain those authorities if the authorizing legislation has expired? <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;archive&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;2006&#x2F;March&#x2F;06_opa_113.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;archive&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;2006&#x2F;March&#x2F;06_opa_113...</a><p>&gt; The reauthorizing legislation makes permanent 14 of the 16 sunsetted USA PATRIOT Act provisions and places four-year sunsets on the other two Thanks!<p>&gt; and places four-year sunsets on the other two<p>It looks like those were sections 206 and 215, which were somewhat weakened by the same act.<p>Confusingly, there&#x27;s a third provision, the &quot;lone wolf&quot; provision, which was extended during the Obama administration; that seems to be part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and got rolled into the &quot;USA Freedom Act&quot; reauthorization in 2015. Any investigation opened prior to the expiration can be continued under it. Surprisingly they opened quite a few &#x27;open ended&#x27; investigations.

This. The departments have different standards and sharing might not be compliant Well the Patriot Act was not going to just pass its self. The national guardsman who leaked classified Ukraine intelligence seemingly for internet cred? That access was enabled by post-9&#x2F;11 data sharing.<p>To be fair, we don&#x27;t know what that data sharing prevented, so that leak might just be the price to pay for preventing another 9&#x2F;11. &quot;What would be the negatives with sharing information with each other? &quot;<p>In general in the dark world of secret services, there is a &quot;need to know&quot; principle, about protecting sources.<p>Meaning, what someone does not know, he cannot leak.\nBecause when the enemy knows, that file X leaked and he knows that only 5 persons had access to that file, they can find the source easily.<p>That has been happened a lot of times accidently, but likely has even been used to activly sabotage each others operations, as the bosses of each others service did not liked each other to put mildly.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wedge:_The_Secret_War_Between_the_FBI_and_CIA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wedge:_The_Secret_War_Betwee...</a> Oh man, there have been many times when the American navy and air force would probably have rather declared war on each other than the enemy.<p>Government entities have budgets, and people will always fight over resources. Even to the point that the mission is like 2nd or 5th priority. They were firewalled in the Nixon years after a long train of abuses.  Think the Hoover years. The CIA should have zero contact with the FBI. So you&#x27;d prefer the CIA had arrest powers for intelligence breaches? I don’t think we should have a CIA. Oh, so when you said &quot;The CIA should have zero contact with the FBI.&quot; you meant that because the CIA wouldn&#x27;t exist. Got it. Absolutely, it’s an organization designed to wreak havoc on the rest of the world to protect our interests… Im not ok with that being a thing at all to be perfectly honest. Sure. Now if we could just make sure other countries did the same and never step in in future to fill that vacuum, then we&#x27;d have a better world. The CIA is uniquely bad by degree but not category. The CIA is not supposed to be looking inward unless it&#x27;s directly related to a foreign intelligence mission, and open collaboration with law enforcement would make it almost impossible to enforce that principle.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Posse_Comitatus_Act\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Posse_Comitatus_Act</a><p>This principle has been softened and defanged quite a bit since 9&#x2F;11. Maintaining separation of powers. &gt; Maintaining separation of powers.<p>FYI, SoP concerns branches, not agencies:<p><pre><code>     Separation of powers refers to the division of a state&#x27;s government into &quot;branches&quot;, each with separate, independent powers and responsibilities, so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with those of the other branches.[1]\n\n</code></pre>\nLike the Dept. of Justice, Dept. of State, Dept. of the Interior, the FCC the EPA, etc. etc., both the FBI and the CIA are housed with the executive branch of government, and are both executive branch agencies. The FBI is organized under the Justice Department and answers to the Attorney General, is a law enforcement agency but also an intelligence agency that reports to the Director of National Intelligence, <i>just like the CIA</i>, which is organized under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Congress, the legislative branch, has oversight via control of both FBI and CIA budgets, but the point to be gleaned here is that <i>it is not the separation of powers</i> that prevents FBI and CIA from sharing information, but instead, generally speaking, their separate mandates. FBI is a domestic law enforcement and intelligence agency, while CIA is not a law enforcement agency but instead an intelligence gathering agency that does intelligence analysis, and specifically information only regarding foreign countries and their citizens. Unlike the FBI, CIA is prohibited from collecting information regarding &quot;U.S. Persons,&quot; which includes U.S. citizens, resident aliens, legal immigrants, and U.S. corporations, regardless of where they are located.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Separation_of_powers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Separation_of_powers</a> Wouldn&#x27;t the actual power be with the courts who would be the people convicting anyone accused of a crime by either FBI or CIA? &gt; Wouldn&#x27;t the actual power be with the courts who would be the people convicting anyone accused of a crime by either FBI or CIA<p>Now let&#x27;s think about how this would work.<p>The CIA obtains some information on a US citizen who is suspected of a crime, using methods that would be a violation of their constitutional rights, and therefore not be admissible as evidence against them in court.<p>The CIA can then (a) not share the information with the FBI; (b) share it with them, but they are not allowed to use it for anything because of how it was obtained; or (c) share it with them, and then they use it via parallel construction, in violation of the constitutional rights of the accused, and without revealing where they actually got it, causing &quot;public trials&quot; to become mendacious and opaque.<p>But (b) and (c) are the same thing, because the only use of (b) is to let (c) happen in secret. The CIA don’t need the the courts permission to execute anyone suspected of being a threat to the US, if said principal is outside the US ;) I know they have a lawyer-drafted justification on file with the DOJ, but to the point of “courts permission” has that actually ever been tested in a real court (not FISA)? And if so is the decision public? It&#x27;s unlikely that a corpse files suit to protect their constitutional rights, of which no one is aware were violated in the first place. However unlikely, it is possible. Many such cases where the estate of the dead or their families have brought suit against the US government.<p>Example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;usa-court-yemen&#x2F;u-s-appeals-court-throws-out-lawsuit-over-drone-strike-deaths-idUSL1N1JR1HM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;usa-court-yemen&#x2F;u-s-appeals-...</a> You do realize the article you just linked starts with &quot;threw out a lawsuit by the families&quot; Obviously. My original question was whether the justification for extrajudicial killings has yet been tested by a court, as claimed And if in the US and a beneficiary of the paperclip operation whose downsides outweigh benefits, Cia-trained Mossad agents were available. Hence why they are loved across the world :) The CIA operates outside the law by design. They just need to say they&#x27;re doing it for &quot;national security reasons&quot;. There are laws that attempted to curtail these powers, but it has never done anything other than creating additional paperwork. The office of the president maintains the right to order execution of anyone without trial, so there is no need for courts. When I saw they comment I had a similar thought. Of course the separation of powers is about balance between the branches of government, and the CIA and FBI are both in the same branch.<p>But having them separate allows the Administrative branch to operate in a way that hypothetically shouldn’t step on the toes of the judicial. (Well, that is the hope at least). I imagine a big component of it is sensitive information is easier to manage when less people and organizations are involved. Having law enforcement and intel separate is a common seperation of powers thing (e.g. in canada intel was separated out from police after a controversey where rcmp burnt down a barn where they thought terrorists were meeting) IANAL, but one sensible reason  could be that the CIA investigates in a manner which is not always consistent with the FBI&#x27;s rules for gathering evidence. Sharing the wrong information could poison prosecution. Saying that it was not permitted doesn&#x27;t mean that the information was not shared in some ways. After all, the whole purpose of CIA is to gather information by whatever means. The origin is that the CIA came into existence when the FBI&#x2F;J Edgar Hoover were at their height of their influence.<p>The FBI, military, and state department had an effective veto over new powers for the CIA, so the CIA agreed to lots of rules to make them happy: no overlapping function, no recruiting current employees, etc.<p>The argument was: “combining domestic and foreign intelligence is something the Nazis and Communists do, so it’s bad.”<p>There have evolved good reasons for the distinctions. The CIA never engages in criminal prosecution, so doesn’t need to worry about revealing evidence as part of a prosecution. FBI agents, by contrast, are paranoid about what information they are exposed to, for fear it could come out in court.<p>That’s much more recent, and would have been a surprise to Hoover. In fact, Hoover used the FBI to filter information gleaned from the Vernona Project. The president would receive summaries of analysts reports that were simply “vouched for” by Hoover.<p>By contrast the DEA was formed during an era when federal law enforcement and intelligence were at a low point in influence, so they stole people, mission, and influence. That’s why the DEA has its own foreign intelligence, domestic intelligence, diplomatic corps, and even judicial system. A state is also a threat to its citizens. It&#x27;s power must be limited through careful checks and balances. These create intentional inefficiencies. Combining the internal policing function with external espionage creates an organisation wilding the state monopoly on violence against its own citizens and able to claim it&#x27;s actions are state secrets. Go ask how those released after years of imprisonment and torture in Guantanamo Bay without access to anything but a cruel mockery of due process how they feel about unchecked state power? Would prefer to talk to Uyghurs who managed escape from China instead?<p>The state must be kept limited in all its powers even in its power to protect from harm. Accepting the consequences of these intentional limitations is a price a society must pay for liberty or face the consequences.<p>In my opinion the USA has repeatedly fallen short in this regard. Coming back to your question here is an example of harm caused by (one-sided) information sharing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parallel_construction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parallel_construction</a> . FBI could spy on Americans for the CIA &gt; I imagine this sort of thing happened all the time.<p>Ah well that settles  it then, nothing to see here, anybody who thinks or talks any further about it must be a crazy conspiracy cook.

Insurance firms have anti-fraud teams on alert for coincidences like this. There would be an investigation.<p>Anyways, your example trivializes the stakes and power involved. Whenever 9&#x2F;11 and the followup &quot;War on Terror&quot; comes up, I remember this:<p>&quot;In 1998, Kristol and Kagan advocated regime change in Iraq throughout the Iraq disarmament process through articles that were published in the New York Times.<p>Following perceived Iraqi unwillingness to co-operate with UN weapons inspections, core members of the PNAC including Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, R. James Woolsey, Elliott Abrams, Donald Rumsfeld, Robert Zoellick, and John Bolton were among the signatories of an open letter initiated by the PNAC to President Bill Clinton calling for the removal of Saddam Hussein.Portraying Saddam Hussein as a threat to the United States, its Middle East allies, and oil resources in the region.<p>Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the PNAC sent a letter to President George W. Bush, specifically advocating regime change through &quot;a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.&quot;<p>The letter suggested that &quot;any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq,&quot; even if no evidence surfaced linking Iraq to the September 11 attacks.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Calls_for_regime_change_in_Iraq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_for_the_New_American_C...</a> If anyone is curious about 9&#x2F;11 and wants to learn more, I highly recommend<p>September 11: The New Pearl Harbor: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8DOnAn_PX6M?t=655\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8DOnAn_PX6M?t=655</a><p>It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t attempt to provide explanations on its own, it simply asks questions based on text from the commission report, and news footage and documentaries you find on CNN, NBC, etc. I remember the Documentary “Loose Change” about this.

After that point, it creates the impression that they were trying to do their job in good faith. Pretty much. It’s not an “inside job” as much as it was a tragedy of errors.<p>The CIA having a double agent inside Al Qaeda sounds like a great plan… until you find out these men were involved in a terrorist plot that succeeded in killing thousands.<p>But no one has ever done what they did before. &gt;Before that point, it sounds like some kind of mkultra style conspiracy where they are actively malicious.<p>The CIA MKULTRA program was a fact, not a conspiracy.  Evidence of this program was discovered when the CIA inadvertently failed to illegally destroy documentation detailing the program.  The known fallout from this program includes the Unabomber.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;09&#x2F;758989641&#x2F;the-cias-secret-quest-for-mind-control-torture-lsd-and-a-poisoner-in-chief\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;09&#x2F;758989641&#x2F;the-cias-secret-que...</a><p>The entire history of the CIA is actively malicious.  &quot;Their job&quot; is to lie, murder, kidnap, torture and otherwise manipulate every nation on the planet (including our own) in order to maintain their own power and US global hegemony.  Anyone who doubts this should look into MKULTRA, Operation Northwoods, Operation Chaos, Operation Mockingbird, The Phoenix Program, Operation Paperclip - and these are just some of the CIA activities we know about. You&#x27;re confusing &quot;conspiracy&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.  GP is not claiming that MKUltra is a fiction or claimed by some unproven conspiracy theory.<p>MKUltra was a real conspiracy, meaning members of the CIA worked together on something we consider wrongful. As was pointed out by others, I did not call it false.<p>Something else to point out:<p>&gt; The known fallout from this program includes the Unabomber.<p>I know that it&#x27;s been said that Kaczynski was victimized by mkultra but that does not mean mkultra was responsible for his later actions. Plenty of others impacted didn&#x27;t go on to be serial killers. Edit: and googling, it seems like there&#x27;s some who say that the specific Harvard experiment he was a subject in was not CIA. &gt; including our own<p>Their &quot;job,&quot; insofar as it requires lying to people, explicitly does <i>not</i> include lying or manipulating the American people. &gt;Their &quot;job,&quot; insofar as it requires lying to people, explicitly does not include lying or manipulating the American people.<p>Lying to the American people was the explicit goal of Operation Mockingbird, in addition to many other (known) CIA operations.<p>I would suggest that anyone who has a rosy (and false) view of what the CIA does (and has done) spend some time watching the Church Committee hearings (which themselves only scratched the surface). You&#x27;re defining &quot;their job&quot; as what they choose to do. I&#x27;m defining it as their mandate from congress. I agree with you that they have a long history of domestic manipulation and spying. That doesn&#x27;t make it their job. They&#x27;re committing a crime every time they violate their mandate; the CIA is a criminal organization that should be disbanded.<p>Their mandate from congress does not give them permission to operate domestically. So operation mockingbird is one example (of many, as you say) of the CIA doing what it <i>thinks</i> is its job, or at least, doing whatever it wants because it knows it will never be held accountable (especially as long as it keeps blackmail files on the senators overseeing it). Or just trying to do their job. Their whole MO flies in the face of &quot;good faith&quot;. Even when telling the truth, its always done so strategically. Like many foreign intelligence agencies, the CIA are the organizational equivalent of a sociopath and should be regarded as such, even by Americans. I think a lot of CIA scandals over the decades do involve good faith, but also stupidity. They&#x27;ve sometimes been warped enough to think that doing obviously wrong stuff is good for the country and the world. The cold war in particular had a ton of this distorted thinking. Did anyone actually read the article or is everyone just upvoting this because of the title? It says nothing about the CIA covering up an involvement in 9&#x2F;11, and talks about covering up intelligence blunders. &gt; It says nothing about the CIA covering up an involvement in 9&#x2F;11<p>The title doesn’t say that the CIA was involved in 9&#x2F;11. No, not literally. But a &quot;9&#x2F;11 coverup&quot; suggests a coverup about the <i>substance</i> of the events on 9&#x2F;11, rather than a coverup about the extent or manner of intelligence operations that preceded it. Calling it a &quot;pre-9&#x2F;11 intelligence gathering coverup&quot; would be more helpful. But it&#x27;s implied. Should be rewritten to &#x27;9&#x2F;11 mishandling coverup&#x27; or some other noun to negate the click bait. but lets not pretend that&#x27;s not on peoples minds when they read the title. it seems like it ought to be going out of its way to avoid that implication. I did not interpret the headline that way. I’m not sure why someone would jump straight to that aside from the “Bush did 9&#x2F;11” memes that get circulated every now and then. Ya thats one reason. It&#x27;s an incredibly well known conspiracy theory. I think most readers would&#x27;ve passed over the thought when reading the title and assumed thats what it was referencing. I’m still not buying that “most readers” are so familiar with that conspiracy theory that they would jump to “FBI agents have taken it upon themselves to publicly accuse the CIA in involvement in 9&#x2F;11”<p>There is so much room for discussion about incompetence and bad systems when talking about 9&#x2F;11. There was even a whole tv show with Jeff Daniels a few years ago that managed to talk about it without reading like lyrics from an Anti Flag album. They might not settle on that as the most likely interpretation, but I would bet money that it was one of if not the first interpretation that came to mind for most. I think title authors are accountable for such things, and less discriminating readers will not make their way all the way to more reasonable interpretations. It is not the author’s job to proactively search out and adjust for crazy interpretations of mundane sentences. That rule would be funny.<p>“NOAA reports record hurricane activity — BUT DON’T WORRY HAARP ISN’T INVOLVED” would be a hilarious but pointless headline. But he did. Maybe. (Bandar) &quot;Bush&quot;. :p This piece of the story I do not understand.<p>&quot;People in a position to know have suggested that the CIA concealed information about Hazmi and Mihdhar’s travel because the CIA wanted to recruit them through Saudi intelligence, which would go a long way to support the defense theory that the United States and Al Qaeda are not at war...&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t grasp how showing the CIA was attempting to recruit these people as operatives proves we are not currently at war with Al Qaeda; intelligence services try to recruit operatives in an opposing force&#x27;s camp all the time. It&#x27;s worth remembering that Al Qaeda in Syria (under various other names) was funded and armed by the United States, Britain, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar according to numerous published reports, and that fighters for the organization were trained at secret CIA&#x2F;military bases in Jordan and Turkey, and that the CIA operation in Libya in coordination with Qatar (out of Benghazi) funneled Libyan weapons to the organization for use against the Syrian government.<p>For example:\n&quot;Arming Syrian rebels: Where the US went wrong 10 October 2015 BBC&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine-33997408\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine-33997408</a><p>&gt; &quot;Those who supported his approach, the Arms for Rebels group, included then-CIA Director David Petraeus, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and most of the foreign-policy establishment in Washington, both Democrat and Republican.&quot;<p>&quot;Behind the Sudden Death of a $1 Billion Secret C.I.A.

Well it&#x27;s a legal defense and IANAL. I think what they are getting at is that the US gov and these groups have a long history and they are allies more often than not.<p>* 1980s Afgan-Soviet War: Allies<p>* 1990s Balkins Wars: Allies<p>* late 90s attacks in Africa and Middle East: Enemies?<p>* Post 2001: Mortal Enemies<p>* Post 2011 Arab Spring: Allies in overthrowing the Syrian state. It started much earlier than that, when the CIA took over Nazi Muslim terrorist networks after WWII, and from that started working with the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s. Ian Johnson&#x27;s _A Mosque In Munich_ is a must-read if you are at all interested in why 9&#x2F;11 happened:<p><pre><code>  Privately, President Eisenhower seemed concerned about how to reach the Muslim world. He wrote to his confidant, the Presbyterian church leader Edward Elson, that Islam and the Middle East were always on his mind. “I assure you that I never fail in any communication with Arab leaders, oral or written, to stress the importance of the spiritual factor in our relationships. I have argued that belief in God should create between them and us the common purpose of opposing atheistic communism.” In White House meetings he was more blunt. Speaking with the CIA covert operations czar Frank Wisner and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Eisenhower said that Arabs should dip into their own religion for inspiration in fighting communism. “The President said he thought we should do everything possible to stress the ‘holy war’ aspect,’ according to a memo outlining the conversation. “Mr. Dulles commented that if the Arabs have a ‘holy war they would want it to be against Israel. The President recalled, however, that [King Ibn] Saud, after his visit here, had called on all Arabs to oppose Communism.” The Operations Coordinating Board — the body set up to imple- ment covert plans by the CIA and other agencies — took up Islam. It had already produced a detailed study of Buddhism and how that religion could be used to further U.S. interests. In 1957, the board established an Ad Hoc Working Group on Islam that included offi- cials from the U.S. Information Agency, the State Department, and the CIA. According to a memo on the groups first meeting, its goal was to take stock of what public and private U.S. organizations were doing in the field of Islam and come up with an “Outline Plan of Operations.’ The plan had two main components, both of which were echoed in CIA actions in Munich. First, the United States would shun traditional Muslims in favor of “reform” groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood. Then, as today, the Brotherhood’s radi- cal political agenda of a return to a mythic state of pure Islam was obfuscated by its members’ use of modern symbols, such as West- ern clothing and rhetoric. “Both the Chairman and the CIA mem- ber felt that with the Islamic world being divided as it is between reactionary and reformist groups, it might be found profitable to place emphasis on programs which would strengthen the reformist groups.” In May, the coordination board passed the inventory and plan of action. Its statements were clear and simple: Islam is a natural ally, communists are exploiting Islam, and Islam affects the balance of power. The paper listed a dozen recommendations for strengthen- ing ties with Islamic organizations, especially those with a strong anticommunist bent. As always, the operations were to be covert. “Programs which are indirect and unattributable are more likely to be effective and will avoid the charge that we are trying to use reli- gion for political purposes,’ the report concluded. “Overt use of Is- lamic organizations for the inculcation of hard-line propaganda is to be avoided”</code></pre> What? There is not one mention in that wall of words of any Muslim groups being either Nazis or terrorists. If you knew Hitler&#x27;s plans for the Arabs you would know it doesn&#x27;t even make sense. This smacks of far-right Israeli propaganda. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;mosqueinmunichna0000john_a7m7&#x2F;page&#x2F;126&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;mosqueinmunichna0000john_a7m7&#x2F;pa...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ian-johnson.com&#x2F;a-mosque-in-munich\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ian-johnson.com&#x2F;a-mosque-in-munich</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reich_Ministry_for_the_Occupied_Eastern_Territories\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reich_Ministry_for_the_Occupie...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Azerbaijani_SS_volunteer_formations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Azerbaijani_SS_volunteer_forma...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kaukasisch-Mohammedanische_Legion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kaukasisch-Mohammedanische_Leg...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_Caucasian_and_Mountain-Caucasian_legions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_Caucasian_and_Mountain-C...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Turkestan_Legion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Turkestan_Legion</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Idel-Ural_Legion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Idel-Ural_Legion</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;23rd_Waffen_Mountain_Division_of_the_SS_Kama_(2nd_Croatian)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;23rd_Waffen_Mountain_Division_...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;13th_Waffen_Mountain_Division_of_the_SS_Handschar_(1st_Croatian)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;13th_Waffen_Mountain_Division_...</a> Thank you for the data, some of which, I&#x27;ll say with qualification, was new to me. I would say information but it took a lot of wading through unrelated and tangentially related links to find what you are talking about. I recommend reading the book (Ian Johnson&#x27;s <i>A Mosque In Munich: Nazis, The CIA, And The Rise Of The Muslim Brotherhood In The West</i>) because it is the first (and, AFAIK, so far only) study where all the &quot;tangentially related links&quot; are explained in context. Johnson did an excellent job of perusing West German and newly declassified CIA documents, as well as tracking down and interviewing surviving participants of the events. It is not something you can credibly explain in one post. I guess I don&#x27;t understand the writer&#x27;s, or your, focus on the fact they were Muslim when the CIA, and adversarial intelligence agencies generally recruit opportunistically from any disaffected groups. Because that is what the book is about. Specifically, about the history of the Islamic Center of Munich, regularly attended by Mahmoud Abouhalima, the 1993 WTC bomber, and Al Qaeda co-founder and bin Laden mentor Mamdouh Mahmud Salim. I don&#x27;t know what you are trying to imply. As suggested previously, read the book. &quot;Because that is what the book is about.&quot; Is your intention to promote a book? I thought it was to make a point was about US alliances and supporting for terrorists and other unsavoury types going back a long time.<p>That argument would only be stronger if you left it broad by including US support for Catholic Guatemalan dictators and Italian fascists, Protestant White South Africans, Orthodox fascists during the Greek civil war or useful nazis generally. These all predate 1957 but instead you single out Muslim groups to make a more narrow point? I&#x27;m just wondering if you have something against Muslims. That would be as a counter intelligence purpose.  Here the CIA wanted to befriend alqaeda. But not directly. So they went through an ally intelligence route. Even still, I think as a defense the argument that this is evidence of lack of a state of war is easily countered by &quot;but then what happened?&quot; You&#x27;re not wrong, it&#x27;s a ludicrously weak defence, probably designed precisely to cast as wide a discovery net as possible [flagged] I think that&#x27;s a stretch, but Al Qaeda was basically eradicated or forced into hiding between 9&#x2F;11 and the beginning of the Afghan invasion in a desperate attempt to keep the US from attacking. Al Qaeda was in essence a name for bin Ladin&#x27;s bank account, because he was doing VC funding for training fighters and making audacious attacks against the US and the Saudi royals. That financing source was cut immediately, and Ladin-financed people trapped in Afghanistan had to figure out how to escape a country filled with locals who thought (correctly) that the US was going to come and murder everybody because of what these foreign fighters had been doing.<p>After that, the US called everything in the Middle East that it wanted to kill &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; and made &quot;The Taliban,&quot; i.e. the local government, somehow &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; too, or <i>maybe even worse.</i><p>What was &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; and what was &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot; was based on whether we wanted to topple the government or not and unrelated to any qualities or beliefs of the groups. We poured money and weapons into some radical Islamist groups while executing others. I get the idea as a layman from the outside that spies all sort of run in the same circles for obvious reasons, they are getting and exchanging value with eachother and constantly trying to recruit eachother etc. So yesterdays recruit is tomorrows terrorist. And if you’re a spy who is actually connected you’ve likely met with them and used them for info in the past. I assume it’s just how spycraft works.<p>It’s likely a deeply unpleasant and not generally  understandable business. I don’t say that as an excuse rather that it’s just who gets attracted to and works in the scene and how they network. &gt; So yesterdays recruit is tomorrows terrorist.<p>Or perhaps they are all terrorists. &quot;Terrorism&quot; is a political label defined by relationship to state power. From a state perspective a terrorist you support or endorse is simply an ally or asset. Your support is what makes them definitionally not a terrorist, and by removing it you change the category of their actions to terrorism. Sounds very similar to privateers. That sounds a lot like corporate leadership. &gt;So yesterdays recruit is tomorrows terrorist.<p>That is a by product of the decades old, failed, and terrible US Policy of &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; which has causes more global destabilization, and hardship worldwide than anything since Communism left the world stage. &gt; Communism left the world stage.<p>That... didn’t happen. I can&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t more explosive at the time, but this whole tale from Ali Soufan of the FBI that he told the New Yorker in 2006 is absolutely harrowing. The CIA explicitly withheld a single piece of intel that he had requested that could have lead them to prevent 9&#x2F;11.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2006&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2006&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-agent</a> Background of spytalk.co: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;author&#x2F;jeff-stein&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;author&#x2F;jeff-stein&#x2F;</a><p>Background of the article&#x27;s author:<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sethhettena.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sethhettena.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;muckrack.com&#x2F;seth-hettena\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;muckrack.com&#x2F;seth-hettena</a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jeff_Stein_(author)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jeff_Stein_(author)</a> [flagged] [flagged] don&#x27;t the FBI and CIA fight all the time?

It was well known shortly after 9&#x2F;11 that the FBI and CIA did not cooperate, fought with eachother (they still do), but most of all, by law, they couldn&#x27;t communicate with eachother. It&#x27;s not really a particular bombshell. “My agency” infighting by largely ex-officers based on actions where the leadership of the involved agency were on the same page highlighted because it relates to a issue raised in a court case is... A very different thing than a civil war. You can’t understand the US government without recognizing it as a substrate for inter-factional conflict between different segments of the ruling class. It’s organized crime and gang warfare all the way down. ...all the way down to the top. Previous discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35841537\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35841537</a> Sounds like a minor dispute blown up into something sinister. &quot;Coverup&quot; seems like &quot;Lab Leak&quot; in that anyone can project as much evil intent onto the phrase as they want.<p>Did they coverup a failure? Did they coverup their own involvement?<p>I realize that I&#x27;m only discussing the headline, and that the article goes into detail, but I think the headline is intentionally vague to allow this projection. The headline did not sit well with me either, maybe something like &quot;coverup related to 9&#x2F;11&quot; would be better?<p>It&#x27;s funny, I have a very different take on the use of the phrasing &quot;lab leak,&quot; since to me it seems intended to preempt any consideration of an intentional release. I think rather the CIA did in fact recruit them. Since I just watched <i>Chinatown</i> for the nth time, this is fresh on my mind.<p><i>Forget it, Jake. It&#x27;s Chinatown.</i><p>applies here. We don&#x27;t know what really happened and we can&#x27;t. These are people who lie and cover up for a living, even to each other. Even under oath. Exactly, every time you deal with info from CIA and related orgs, you need to understand that their job is to lie and deceive for a particular goal. There is no reason whatsoever to think that what they&#x27;re saying is true, unless it is strongly corroborated by other facts and reports. That may be how they interpret  their job description, but it&#x27;s not the job the taxpayer pays them to do, certainly not when it comes to lying domestically. I watched it for the first time a month back and was blown away. And the central conflict around water scarcity in CA is still incredibly relevant today. What a movie! It really IS the perfect movie. If you want the answer for yourself, you need to demystify &quot;terrorism&quot;, since that is the headline narrative from day one and to this day. When you grok what terrorism really is, the logical conclusion to who did the deed is to answer the question of who benefited, what motives, and look for evidence.<p>Terrorism is a method of rulership over publics, not a tactic of war.  Unless you consider the rule of terrorist ideology to be one of &quot;at war with those under rule&quot;, but that is different model of thinking.  Either way, terrorism comes down to low grade rule by mean and vicious people, the kind you would hope never to elect. Indeed, one might conclude as I have that terrorism is rule by the unelect.<p>Terrorism is not a tactic of warfare, it is violent coercion.  Even that much is obvious, for it coerces people to become defensive, scared, etc.  Civilians are not the target of military for war.  Never have been.  Only pawns can be used to enact terrorism, for no individual has anything to gain by the act.<p>No military strategy has ever used nor teaches terrorist methodologies.  The response by the USA shows precisely why it is foolish, for it gains nothing to the attacker: no territory gained, only an enemy provoked.<p>The accused actors had nothing to gain unless they were pawns for reward, but then that would mean they did not plan it, nor conceive of it from the base notion of coercion toward a benefit.  Nor did the accused actors have a motive.  The narrative already becomes convoluted beyond this point, so I pull out my Swiss Occum Razor and shave it back.  That is when I realize how deep the ideological methodology of terror-ism must be.<p>Terrorism is not the act of rogues and individuals, but this is what you are wanted to believe.  Terrorism is the plan and rule of those found at the conclusion of logical procedure.  Who benefited, what motives, following clues... Your theory falls apart if you assume some small percentage of people may act irrationally. You are sticking to rationalization, so I must argue that.<p>Rationality is the mirror of mystification.  With rationalism you can endlessly circle the argument in defense of thy mystical beliefs.<p>Your mystified understanding of terrorism is that psychological profiles are sufficient. This subverts due process.<p>Nothing about rationality guarantees a positive outcome, and is typically a trick that leads to no conclusion.  That is the very opposite intent of logical conclusion by way of reasoning.<p>Irrationality is simply circling the other direction, actually nothing and no different, but the word is used to create a false dichotomy so you can call somebody crazy by another name, and keep the argument and process couched in mystification.<p>It is literally in the name: the ratio is tangential to the circle. For the philosophers, this is why the pushers of rationalism thrust Kant to the fore, he wrote that reason is insufficient.  That may be true for some types of inward thinking like creativity and invention.  The truth can never be invented though ergo reasoning is perfectly fine for the due process of uncovering the truth.<p>Kant&#x27;s philosophy is used to justify judicial review, where you are guilty until proven innocent, which is precisely why we are forced to recite the complete opposite.  If &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; was true and in force, it would be apparent, and what is known need not be repeated interminably.<p>This is the lie at the root of jurisprudence, and is the conclusion of actually bad reasoning, and is forced via unjustified action we call Justice.  Justice must be justified because punishments are crimes in any other context.<p>As a result, we cannot act with justification based on reason, but must follow strictures, aka laws.  For instance, you maybe cannot defend yourself against a lunatic because it can be rationalized a million ways that self defense was not justified due to <i>circumstances</i>, literally circular positioning, rationalization.<p>Government is religion based on rational mysticism.  It has nothing to do with the power of democracy, freedom, doing what is right, and self determination.  It is moderation by another name, and from on high by elitists who control judiciaries. Where do “eco-terrorists” and similar fit into this paradigm of yours? Rule by ideology leads to every kind of terrorism, but it doesn&#x27;t make the trigger man special, only a pawn.  It is important to know ideology is not about ideas but deos, the &quot;God Complex&quot;.  The terrorist actor is always a zealot.<p>The ideologue behind the plot, the agent or collective agency, they influence the actor via their God Complex which lacks the foundational principles. That is why ideologically driven people are fractious, without a functional spirituality that connects them and maintain virtues such as &quot;do not kill people for no reason&quot; or &quot;unelected action undermines the legitimacy of our very own elected representation!&quot;<p>Global warming is the ideology of ecoterrorism, but we don&#x27;t see multitudes in arms, and we don&#x27;t see their representatives and generals, we only see the limited agents, a parade of the unelect.<p>We don&#x27;t see continuous campaigns, we see odd events.  We see publicity, never discretion.  Violent or not, it is always a performance. And rather than serving their side, terrorist are usually pawns of their own enemy. That is the true art of terrorism.<p>If the ideologue had real power, a military and industry and political strength, they have no reason to influence and orchestrate acts by zealotry.  Power works with diplomacy, and bad diplomats are fast replaced with better ones.  War is the ultimate in diplomacy.<p>Terrorism is always convoluted schemes that do not achieve real ends such as changing policy or destroying the enemy. That is because the motive is ulterior to the action, and not powerful enough to do great damage; the reaction has to be the source of damage. The zealot has no idea about the real motive; they have only good intentions toward the deos.<p>If the actor discovered the motive was not truly their own cause, that wouldn&#x27;t serve.  If they do not, the reward is rarely enough to perform false work, and they do not preserver long.  Such is the case with mass protesting, which is low grade terrorism, intellectually violent if not physically.  If the protest was true in force, they would just sweep away the antagonist. Always look at who has to win from the events. [dead] [dead] Tenet declared WMD in Iraq was a slam dunk. I don&#x27;t know what evidence he presented but my military source in Iraq told me the chemical weapons they found and disposed of had US nomenclature which would make sense since we were helping Iraq deal with Iran in the 80&#x27;s:<p>&quot;According to Iraqi documents, assistance in the development of chemical weapons was obtained from firms in many countries, including the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France. A report stated that Dutch, Australian, Italian, French and both West and East German companies were involved in the export of raw materials to Iraqi chemical weapons factories..&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iraqi_chemical_attacks_against_Iran\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iraqi_chemical_attacks_against...</a><p>End of the day the CIA operates way outside the lines on the field.

The easiest way to ensure your target of investigation has the items you want to say they have is to sell it to them first. A smart thing to do before you invade a country is to make sure it doesn&#x27;t have a meaningful way to retaliate you could also just not invade someone else&#x27;s country. it&#x27;s a pretty easy thing to do There&#x27;s also that funny historical anecdote that Saddam Hussein was literally a CIA assassin for a while... though later him easily taking power because he happened to try a coup just after a CIA-backed one seems to have been just a coincidence ?

The Azov regiment fell last May; our weapons had barely begun arriving in Kyiv then.<p>&gt; <i>this logic worked well for Iraq and Afghanistan</i><p>You&#x27;re comparing a dictator and terrorist insurgencies with a democracy. Ukraine is closer to WWII. We aren&#x27;t trying to create a state where one never existed, destroy a state that was previously stable or cause an insurgency to annoy someone; we&#x27;re helping an extant state fight for survival.<p>(Also, are you arguing <i>nobody</i> in Britain or France or Poland in WWII had problematic views? Does that mean the American war effort, and subsequent Marshall Plan, was in support of those elements?)<p>&gt; <i>the Azov Brigade has been long restored and rearmed.

In an ideal, world, they&#x27;d be expelled. But in an ideal world, Moscow wouldn&#x27;t be launching a land war in Europe. It&#x27;s misleading to the point of incorrectness to say we&#x27;re arming neo-Nazis in Ukraine, or that these people form a significant amount of the present Ukrainian military or state, or that they have material influence over Kyiv.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haaretz.com&#x2F;world-news&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2022-06-01&#x2F;ty-article-magazine&#x2F;.premium&#x2F;understanding-ukrainian-nationalism-and-claims-its-tainted-by-nazism&#x2F;00000181-1a0c-d9b4-a199-be1e4a3c0000\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haaretz.com&#x2F;world-news&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2022-06-01&#x2F;ty-arti...</a> The fascist party has zero seats in parliament. Both the president and prime minister of Ukraine are Jewish and there was discussion about prosecuting Azov before they were wiped out in the fighting. Every country has fascists, overstating their number in Ukraine is Russian propaganda. the ministry of defense in ukraine posts photos on their twitter of soldiers with totenkopf centered prominently Lets use another example to say why it&#x27;s misleading, even if it&#x27;s true.<p>&gt; The US is arming Nazis and Nationalists inside of the United States.<p>This statement is true. There are Nazis and Nationalists inside of the US Military and inside of various police departments.<p>This statement is also misleading. It implies that we&#x27;re giving arms directly to nazis and nationalist, rather than it being a byproduct of poor screening. It also implies that we&#x27;re doing this on purpose, but that isn&#x27;t the case.<p>Now lets try the same thing with Ukraine. If you look at the infamous Azoz battle group you will find nazis. Therefore, it is true that we&#x27;re arming nazis. However, you&#x27;ll also find muslims, jews, and other groups that are decidedly not nazi. At the same time the Wagner group, which is on the Russian side of things, has a lot of nazi and nationalist inside.<p>So yes, the statement is true, but it also misleading. It tries to make a simple point, when the reality is far more nuanced. It&#x27;s just not a good faith argument because it&#x27;s made to push people into believing something that isn&#x27;t true- namely that ukraine is a nazi&#x2F;ultranationalist hotbed that we&#x27;re arming, while russia is trying to fight off the nazi threat. This is propeganda that Russia has been pushing for over a year now, but anyone who looks at the situation can see a nazi threat on the russian side and a bunch of people defending their homes on the other. Nato is arming the state of Ukraine.  The state armed forces have integrated remnants of those splinter factions under a unified command. The complexity of such a situation seems to escape some. Instead they assume (and accuse) we are making a dedicated effort to arm Nazis in Ukraine. This is clearly not the case, it&#x27;s more akin to collateral damage. In that regard, there is one point we should keep in mind though:<p>Once weapons are brought into any theatre of conflict they are very hard to control. Your mischaracterization is blatant. I trust this clarification settles the matter. [flagged] &gt; <i>How do you do that? By supporting the factions that are. What are those factions? Hypernationalists, which in Ukraine&#x27;s case means Banderites &amp; other Nazi-aligned factions</i><p>You&#x27;re describing a tiny fraction of Ukraine&#x27;s armed forces and source of popular support, much of which has been destroyed or captured in the last year of war.

A recent example in my country would be Gaullism, in a way.<p>Are they nazi, or &#x27;just&#x27; cesarists (with even more nationalism on top) ? Do you know who their internal enemy is? It should be designated and different from their actual foreign enemy.

I agree.  I think my point is not that we should invade for humanitarian reasons, but that I don&#x27;t feel too bad about the Iraq invasion, given what I&#x27;ve seen. Obvious Chat GPT is obvious. It might have been flagged because it&#x27;s unnecessarily verbose and reads like it was generated by GPT. 1. al-Qaeda leadership fled Afghanistan for Pakistan before the US invasion, and the US knew it but invaded Afghanistan anyway.<p>2. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s chemical weapons were well known to America, because American intelligence helped him acquire and target those chemical weapons against Iran in the Iraq-Iran War.   Even going so far as to provide him with satellite intelligence for this purpose.<p>3. The &quot;WMDs&quot; used to justify the invasion of Iraq to the public were not chemical gasses.  The US government claimed Iraq had a nuclear weapons program in advanced stages of development.  This was never true and they knew it. There are truths on both sides of the argument IMO.  It&#x27;s not black and white.  But it&#x27;s hard to seriously consider the opinions of those who haven&#x27;t participated in it in any way (government, contractor, military...) and may not even have been born when these things kicked off.  Media is a very biased filter. Also the same day that the UN was presenting evidence of chemical weapons having been  used by Iraq, Donald Rumsfeld was flying there to reassure Saddam Hussein about the US oil pipeline project in Iraq.<p>I think that the chemical weapons might have been used as an excuse for the first Gulf war by George H.W. Bush, 6 years later ?? As with anything complex there will be a lot of reasons. I think Saddams decision to sell oil denominated in Euros was probably influential. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2003&#x2F;feb&#x2F;16&#x2F;iraq.theeuro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2003&#x2F;feb&#x2F;16&#x2F;iraq.theeur...</a><p>Primarily though I think the US govt at the time genuinely thought they could do regime change and create stable democracies in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

    "title": "SCOTUS rules you may sue government agents for damages when they violate rights",
    "text": "While I am heartened by the ruling, I think it&#x27;s important to note that SCOTUS is merely saying that the language of the law allows for personal liability of (and lawsuits against) government officials.<p>Do not rejoice too soon.  If the law gave <i>immunity</i> to officials in their personal capacity, they might have equally ruled that you <i>cannot</i> sue them personally under the law.  The court is making no principled or difficult stand for any kind of civil rights here, hence you may note the unanimous opinion.<p>More and more things are falling to the courts to decide because Congress is paralyzed for some reason having to do with the new atmosphere of microsecond attention span and single-issue voting.  I think we would be wrong to place so much hope in the courts, and rather try to fix what is broken with our system of creating and updating laws. Well, that&#x27;s exactly what the courts on the Federal level are there to do, constitutionally, rule on what the law is, not decide what the law should be. If they do that, they just become a de facto legislature that&#x27;s not elected.<p>The <i>actual</i> legislature, as you note,  is where these fixes need to occur. Using the courts for it is a civics hack, and one that will bite us in the ass. <i>&gt;rule on what the law is, not decide what the law should be</i><p>There&#x27;s a huge grey area there. Both require the court to insert its judgement instead of that of elected officials making the law. Whether or not they are ruling on &quot;what the law should be&quot; is not a binary determination and different people draw the line in different places. Every judicial act at that level is one of interpretation, and that will always necessarily carry the risk of an interpretation that is not in keeping with the legislative intent. In which case the remedy is additional legislation to clarify that intent.<p>In this example, should Congress decide monetary damages should not be in the scope of &quot;appropriate relief&quot;, they can change the law. Right now there are undoubted some-- the DOJ who fought this issue for example-- who believe the court just &quot;decided what the law should be.&quot; That&#x27;s probably in the nature of most decisions the court makes-- the losing side will thing the court got it wrong. They obviously can decide a balance between the law and personal rights when it degrades the latter and the language is unclear. Qualified immunity is a joke and they know it. The wording of the statutes are vague intentionally and in those cases the supreme court can indeed decide how it is to be interpreted since the law makers weren&#x27;t explicit enough. It&#x27;s either that or declare the whole thing unconstitutional &gt; rule on what the law is, not decide what the law should be<p>Seems like that&#x27;s very hard to square with <i>Citizens</i> or <i>Shelby County</i>, both of which overturned quite clearly written laws with long-accepted interpretations.<p>The textualism stuff is, at best, an excuse used when the court wants to do nothing.  It doesn&#x27;t limit the court when it wants to make changes.  In this case, the court took as narrow a step as possible into the minefield that leads to Qualified Immunity.  It&#x27;s a baby step in the right direction, but it&#x27;s just a baby step. Citizens United was based on the law being unconstitutional, not the court’s interpretation of the law. I know the reasoning.  It was a (very) novel interpretation of the <i>constitution</i> (both the extension of corporate personhood and the notion of money-as-speech were completely new tricks) that allowed it.  Again, it&#x27;s just excuse-making.  If you don&#x27;t want to do something you write a narrow opinion and put the responsibility on congress to provide specificity.  If you want to do something big you throw out a law based on the constitution.<p>In this case, they held the way they did because they did not <i>want</i> to write a broad finding, and absolutely not because their hands were bound by some imaginary principle. This may be totally untrue, but I had a history professor who said that when a company made an argument that it had equal protection under the law from the 15th Amendment, they managed to hire the only living writer of the amendment as their lawyer.  Given that it was written under secrecy, his word was all anyone had to go on.<p>Regardless, the Citizen&#x27;s United decision was actually pretty clearly pro-free speech, and abuses by companies may well be cleaned up as time goes on and more cases reach the Supreme Court (or so said Scalia when I asked him, honestly it did sound like he was a little embarrassed about how his opinion turned out) &gt; but I had a history professor who said that when a company made an argument that it had equal protection under the law from the 15th Amendment,<p>That seems...implausible:<p>Section 1<p>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.<p>Section 2<p>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<p>&gt; they managed to hire the only living writer of the amendment as their lawyer. Given that it was written under secrecy, his word was all anyone had to go on.<p>The Court (and courts in general) don&#x27;t tend to look to <i>authorial</i> intent as the original intent that matters, but <i>legislative</i> intent (the intent of the body&#x2F;(-ies) adopting the provision.) So, the word of the “only living author” wouldn’t be the only thing anyone had to go on; they’d have the records of legislative debates. And an authorial position (even if well-documwnted) that wasn&#x27;t actively considered in legislative debate would probably not be considered to have much weight. &gt; or so said Scalia when I asked him<p>When you asked him about it? That piqued my interest, what was the context? Why&#x27;d he seem embarrassed? The name drop begs for more details :) I don&#x27;t believe that Scalia has ever been embarassed by his blatant intellectual dishonesty in efforts to justify a conclusion he&#x27;d like to reach. &gt; his blatant intellectual dishonesty<p>Sincerely curious:  do you have examples?<p>Scalia&#x27;s a controversial justice, to say the least, for a variety of reasons, but I don&#x27;t quite understand this criticism.  (I do understand not liking his jurisprudence or his abrasive style.)  He and Justice Ginsburg, for example, were famous friends while holding opposite opinions about how to interpret and read the U.S. Constitution; one would think she would&#x27;ve called him out on blatant dishonesty (intellectual or otherwise) It&#x27;s been ten years.  Have there been any meaningful restrictions on those rights in that time?  I don&#x27;t know of any. Citizens United (the group) was a non-profit advocacy group that wanted to publish a video critical of a politician. The government wanted to stop that video from being published. That is not money-as-speech, it&#x27;s speech-as-speech. <i>Citizen&#x27;s United</i> (the case) held that any government restriction on political spending was presumptively illegal and in violation of the first amendment.  That is exactly my point.  It was NOT a narrow ruling tailored toward the needs of PACs trying to avoid censorship.  It was a extremely broad ruling throwing out the whole concept of campaign finance regulation. This is a common and misleading description. I encourage you to read the decision and at least part of Stevens&#x27;s dissent (which is twice as long as the decision itself). I know it&#x27;s a lot of pages, but it&#x27;s got big fat margins.<p>Now.<p>(Reposting a comment I made elsewhere)<p>Before Citizens United, any US majority-owned corporation or union was allowed to make political contributions from a segregated fund. The money in that fund could only come from employees and shareholders. This was, in decades of previous legislation and case law, considered sufficient to protect the 1st Amendment interests of associations of individuals. They can pool their money together for political purposes, put they can&#x27;t pool it with <i>other</i> people&#x27;s money.<p>Before the ruling, Citizens United was allowed to spend money on political activity. They were allowed to spend money on political activity close to an election. They were allowed to spend money, close to an election, to broadcast issue-based political advertisement (e.g., for or against a ballot initiative) on TV. They were allowed to spend money distributing their documentary in any way <i>other</i> than broadcasting it on TV. They could show it in theaters. They could put it on the internet. They could print DVDs and mail them out. They could distribute it to PACs and campaigns for them to spend their own money distributing it, including broadcasting by on TV. They could pay money, close to an election, from a segregated fund, to broadcast their documentary on TV. <i>All</i> they weren&#x27;t allowed to do was spend money, close to an election, on broadcasting something expressing  views for or against a political candidate, on television or radio, to an audience of at least 50,000, close to the election.<p>Corporations were not banned from electioneering before Citizens United. They were <i>restricted</i>. The laws imposing those restrictions went back until at least the early 1900s. There was a century of case law find some such restrictions constitutional. There was a decision in 2003, just 7 years before Citizens United, upholding the very restrictions that CU struck down. The majority&#x27;s argument rested on the idea that no &quot;identity-based&quot; restrictions on 1st-Amendment rights are constitutional. But there <i>are</i> such restrictions, e.g. against prisoners, students, and employees of the executive branch. These restrictions remain in place today. The majority invented a 1st-Amendment principle and then selectively applied it to corporations. They did so with <i>no</i> fact-finding in the record of the case on whether the provisions they struck down <i>actually</i> chilled free speech. Fact-finding that the government wanted to do before Citizens United (the organization) dropped the issue.<p>The majority in Citizens United flipped the table on decades of election law that had survived scrutiny several times before without even claiming that any circumstances had changed. They did it solely because they didn&#x27;t like the outcome. And they bent over backwards to do it. &gt; It was a (very) novel interpretation of the constitution (both the extension of corporate personhood and the notion of money-as-speech were completely new tricks)<p>No they weren&#x27;t. Money as speech, for instance, was a bedrock of earlier campaign finance decisions stretching back at least to <i>Buckley v. Valeo</i>, 424 U.S. 1 (1976).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supreme.justia.com&#x2F;cases&#x2F;federal&#x2F;us&#x2F;424&#x2F;1&#x2F;#tab-opinion-1951589\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supreme.justia.com&#x2F;cases&#x2F;federal&#x2F;us&#x2F;424&#x2F;1&#x2F;#tab-opini...</a> Corporate personhood is a very long established legal concept. It even pre-dates the foundation of the USA, with the principle found in India well over 2000 years ago and in the legal status of Medieval guilds. There is nothing novel about it. The very word corporation derives from the Latin &quot;corpus&quot; or body.<p>I&#x27;m a Brit so have not particular standing in this. If I were a US citizen I would deplore the Citizen&#x27;s United decision, but not on the grounds of corporate personhood (which as I understand it was never mentioned in the ruling), but rather on the grounds that religious freedom should not grant special rights and privileges not available otherwise. It should be a freedom of belief, not a freedom of action. Religious freedom (of either type) isn&#x27;† relevant in any way to Citizen United as far as I&#x27;m aware- can you clarify the nature of your objection? If one person has a right to free speech then logically groups of people have rights to free speech, there&#x27;s really no other way to look at that. What is so novel about holding that the First Amendment means what it says about the rights of freedom of speech and to peaceably assemble? Because it holds that right applies to the ability to pay for media space and not to speak or assemble, and to be done by a PAC, not a person. How do you think assemblies of people get together to speak who can’t all be in the same place at the same time? They have been paying spokespeople since time immemorial. I don&#x27;t think anyone here is interested in debating the merits of <i>Citizen&#x27;s</i> from first principles.  Suffice it to say that your reasoning is not the one the court chose, so I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going with this.<p>My point was simply the wording above: the court CHOSE to issue a very broad decision in Citizen&#x27;s, just as it chose NOT to issue one here.  And the reason is just simple desire and not any kind of principle.  The court wanted to, and that&#x27;s as far as it goes.  You see the same skew in logic in arguments about Roe, where the same people (like you) who think Citizen&#x27;s is fine for throwing out huge regulatory areas based on a novel reading of the constitution suddenly think it&#x27;s &quot;judicial activism&quot; to find a right to medical privacy in the due process clause. I was merely responding to your specific comment which seemed to suggest that a holding that groups have First Amendment rights and that they can pay people to represent them was somehow novel.<p>“It was a (very) novel interpretation of the constitution (both the extension of corporate personhood and the notion of money-as-speech were completely new tricks) that allowed it.”<p>There is an enormous volume of prior case law that says the same thing. What’s the difference between a court opining that a law is unconstitutional and a court interpreting a law as unconstitutional? Citizens United was based on the Court interpreting the statute as imposing restrictions on political speech (prosecuting a non-profit for distribution of a movie about Hilary Clinton) that are invalid under the first amendment. That’s not a situation where the court is saying what the law should be; they’re saying what kinds of laws are allowed under the constitution and which aren’t.<p>Here, the argument isn’t about the constitution. It’s about what “appropriate relief” means in the statute. The second is analyzing the law, and finding a provision that conflicts with a provision of the constitution. It’s not very formal, but it’s more than opinion.<p>It’s not quite that pure. If there are self-contradictions in the constitution, then that gives them some choice about what to compare the law to. They ought to balance that appropriately, but their biases surely creep in. The Supreme Court issues opinions. That&#x27;s the actual word they use to describe what they write. You can either form an opinion or you can discover a truth. The Supreme Court does not discover whether it is true or not that a law is constitutional or unconstitutional. Each member forms an opinion, and whichever consensus opinion includes the majority of justices, that becomes the opinion by which other courts proceed to interpret the law.<p>You might want to mask &quot;discover the truth&quot; with &quot;finding a provision&quot;, but the Supreme Court does not &quot;find provisions that conflict with other provisions&quot;, they interpret things to form opinions. In this case 5 of them interpreted a provision to be in conflict with the way they interpreted a provision of the constitution. 4 of them did not share either or both of those interpretations. It&#x27;s not &quot;interpreting a law as unconstitutional&quot;, just &quot;interpreting the law&quot;. As in &quot;how does the law apply to this situation?&quot;. So there’s an external source for this objective information, or are the judges making their own individual interpretations of “how the law applies”? If the former, why do we end up with split votes that so often fall down partisan lines? Seems like if there were a correct interpretation of a law as distinct from an opinion of a law, they would all have access to it and we could cut the justices down from 9 to 1. And we could call that judge The Conveyor of Truth.<p>Also, why are Supreme Court opinions literally called opinions, if they are apparently objective? I didn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s objective or that there is a single &quot;correct&quot; interpretation of every law. OK. I was responding to parent, which stated there is a difference between a judge&#x27;s interpretation of constitutionality and literal constitutionality - i.e. that a law can be unconstitutional regardless of whether a judge interprets it to be such. Which is obviously nonsense.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure what your point is. I was responding to the specific question you asked:<p>&gt; What’s the difference between a court opining that a law is unconstitutional and a court interpreting a law as unconstitutional?<p>That question was a reply to this comment:<p>&gt; Citizens United was based on the law being unconstitutional, not the court’s interpretation of the law.<p>That comment is referring to two different things SCOTUS can do:<p>1. Throw out a law because it is unconstitutional.<p>2. Interpret the law by deciding how it applies in a particular case.<p>They&#x27;re saying the Citizens United ruling was of the first type, not the second.<p>You seemed to miss that, so I was trying to clarify it. That&#x27;s all. &gt; They&#x27;re saying the Citizens United ruling was of the first type, not the second.\nYou seemed to miss that, so I was trying to clarify it.<p>I did not miss that. I was responding to it. Perhaps you are not understanding what I am saying.<p>How did they determine CU was of the first type? Did they interpret it to be of the first type, or is there an objective view of it that simply makes it so? And if the latter, where is this objective view located that all can see? And why did 4 of the 5 justices not have access to see the objective view?<p>In other words: deciding something is unconstitutional and interpreting something as unconstitutional are exactly the same thing. There is no such thing as unconstitutional outside of interpretation. We read dcolkitt&#x27;s comment differently.<p>You read:<p>&gt; Citizens United was based on the law being [objectively] unconstitutional, not the court’s interpretation of the law [being that it is an unconstitutional one].<p>I read:<p>&gt; Citizens United was based on the law being unconstitutional [in the opinion of the court], not the court’s interpretation of [how] the [constitutionally-compatible and therefore still on the books] law [should be applied to Citizens United]. OK. My interpretation seems to be much closer to the words as written. I&#x27;d give myself credit for being a textualist, if I didn&#x27;t think that label was just a scam.<p>In any case, your read is that the court had an opinion about the constitutionality of CU (which is exactly what it had). And my read is exactly the same: opinion = interpretation. A law can be so blatantly and obviously unconstitutional that everyone can see it and refuses to arrest or charge people for breaking it. It&#x27;s pretty easy to construct test examples, &quot;Bob Smith must pay 2x tax&quot;, or &quot;Black people can&#x27;t do X&quot;.<p>The supreme court doesn&#x27;t make a law unconstitutional. It already was or wasn&#x27;t. They provide notice to the system that the law will now be seen as unconstitutional or not.<p>If they get it wrong (lets say we know because another SC overrules them in the future) it doesn&#x27;t change the constitutionality of the law, just whether it&#x27;s enforceable or not during those periods. &gt;The supreme court doesn&#x27;t make a law unconstitutional. It already was or wasn&#x27;t.<p>No. If the Supreme Court is asked whether a law is constitutional or not, they form an opinion on whether it is or is not. The law exists as law up until the moment the Supreme Court is asked and interprets it one way or the other. It does not exist as one or the other until that moment, even though it is the law, and after that moment it only exists as one or the other based upon the majority opinion of 9 people. Laws are not discovered to be constitutional or unconstitutional, because interpretations are not discovered, they are formed.<p>&gt;A law can be so blatantly and obviously unconstitutional that everyone can see it and refuses to arrest or charge people for breaking it.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make the law unconstitutional. It just makes it a bad law. Bad laws can also be constitutional. The SC isn&#x27;t supposed to concern itself with justice, that&#x27;s a sticky matter for the legislators. Their job is to make sure that the legislators followed rules (wrote laws which do not contradict the constitution) and that those laws are properly applied.<p>Yes, every individual judge has their own skills and opinions and as such, sees the legal question slightly differently, and has different legal interests and thus knows some law more than other. We have a nine as a balance between not having enough diverse backgrounds such that we might be missing the critical input some day weighed against the group being to big to be convenient.<p>&gt; why do we end up with split votes that so often fall down partisan lines?<p>People are flawed. Let&#x27;s say some injustice caused you to get into law. You&#x27;re likely going to be more familiar with that area, and more sensitive to its harms, than another judge. You may not be voting your ideology, you may be there (as a justice) because of your ideology, and you may have your honest beliefs because of your unique experiences.<p>I often read opinions I don&#x27;t agree with, but I can see where the justice just had a different life than me and sees things differently.<p>&gt; Supreme Court opinions literally called opinions, if they are apparently objective?<p>The only use of objectivity in this thread is yours. But if someone did use that phrasing, they&#x27;d mean that the justices should decide the same on the same issue, no matter if it helps a nazi or a nun. Justice is supposed to be blind. &gt;People are flawed.<p>Sure. But it&#x27;s not random flaws. Liberal people are flawed to believe rules are written as a liberal would interpret them. And conservatives just the opposite. Because the rules do not exist outside of subjective interpretation.<p>I may be the only person using the word objective in this conversation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone else in the conversation is not building their arguments on the existence of objectivity in regards to a judges interpretations.<p>&gt;I often read opinions I don&#x27;t agree with, but I can see where the justice just had a different life than me and sees things differently.<p>That&#x27;s right. Their opinion is nothing more than their interpretation. A couple of people had the opinion that something was unconstitutional. That doesn&#x27;t mean it is, just that they believe it is.<p>Justice is supposed to be blind. And the Supreme Court opinion that CU was unconstitutional helps corporations just as it helps pro-choice non-profits just as it helps pro-life non-profits. But at the end of the day, it was 5 people who interpreted it as unconstitutional. They did not make the discovery that it is unconstitutional. I like textualism. The point of the supreme court isn&#x27;t to get everything right, it&#x27;s to kick badly written law back to the legislators. How do you know the text needs fixing if you don&#x27;t stick to the text?<p>Sometimes it is just thrown out to cover bias, but that&#x27;s not its fault. Textualism is nothing more than interpreting something in a way that you believe doesn&#x27;t align with some older thing you also interpreted in a way. &quot;I believe this new law is incompatible with what I believe this old rule says.&quot;<p>You may be right or you may be wrong, anyone can do it, and anyone who does will mostly come to their conclusion based upon their personal political beliefs. Hence, a reason the Supreme Court has so many partisan split rulings.<p>Textualism is pure nonsense, used to present a false sense of rationality to an opinion. Any self-proclaimed textualist is either deceiving themselves or attempting to deceive others. &gt; Textualism is pure nonsense, used to present a false sense of rationality<p>No. You&#x27;re just saying that people have biases and thus <i>everything</i> is a lie.<p>Textualism is a thing, and exists outside of law. Textualists think that the authors specific words are important. &quot;Why did Tolkien say X? It must matter, he&#x27;s a careful author.&quot;<p>I value it in the field of law because legal disputes caused by textual confusion can be avoided through careful writing and textualism leads to the type of thinking that is capable of that. And if nobody cared about the words, how sloppy would the thinking also be? Textualism outside of law is fun. Enjoy. In the context of law, and this entire thread, it&#x27;s nonsense used by people to make themselves think they are smart, or trick other people into thinking they must be smart. In law, <i>everything</i> is textualism, and therefore anyone who claims textualist jurisprudence as a distinct thing they practice are simply attempting to classify anyone else as not smart enough to form valid opinions about what words and phrases mean. &gt; In law, everything is textualism<p>Everything should be. But 95% of everything is really people decrying textualism and actively choosing their ideology.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s nonsense used by people to make themselves think they are smart<p>What nonsense did you use? &gt;But 95% of everything is really people decrying textualism and actively choosing their ideology.<p>Of course the textualist thinks only <i>he</i> is above ideology. This is how you can tell they&#x27;re clowns.

A bunch of words. What do those words mean in combination the the surrounding words? Uh oh, we just hit subjectivity.<p>“Originalism”, “Textualism”, “Absurdism”, etc. are all pure nonsense. Judges, and most particularly Supreme Court judges are definitively expressing their unique opinions as to what a law is, which is identical to “what a law should be”. Someone could attempt to argue that a judge’s opinion of what a law is may not align with what that judge actually believes it should be, but the evidence of consistent partisan split votes makes such an argument particularly weak. &gt;&quot;evidence of consistent partisan split votes makes such an argument particularly weak.&quot;<p>There are a number of judges who &#x27;break the mold&#x27; by taking &#x27;unconventional&#x27; positions in certain cases. Gorsuch, and Scalia before him are known as a criminal defendant&#x27;s beset friend when it comes to evidentiary rules, even though nobody would say they were &#x27;soft on crime&#x27;. On the other hand, there are judges and justices like Alito, Breyer, and Sotomayor who always find a way to decide cases in favor of their preferred litigant. Sure, they each have their own specific beliefs. But none of them are tapped into the objective “what a law is”. Because that doesn’t exist. It’s just a nice mythology we tell ourselves in an attempt to trick our brains into thinking a 3 branch form of government with checks and balances is well checked and well balanced (which it may be, but if we think of 1 branch as objective even when it can’t be, it makes us feel better about the whole system). &gt;&quot;But none of them are tapped into the objective “what a law is”. Because that doesn’t exist.&quot;<p>Well there are canons of interpretation, each of which describes how one can read and understand what legislation and law mean. You seem to be dismissing the canons as being incorrect, and I&#x27;m not exactly sure why.<p>Do you think it is possible to interpret a law faithfully? What about a contract? I’m not dismissing canons of interpretation as being incorrect. I’m stating that canons of interpretation are themselves nothing more than subjective opinion. And there are surely many versions. Some of which align with conservative beliefs and some of which align with liberal beliefs. So what is a “correct” canon of interpretation? Or are canons of interpretation just another layer of obfuscation used to pretend there are objective opinions? &gt; &quot;evidence of consistent partisan split votes makes such an argument particularly weak&quot;<p>Except there isn&#x27;t much of this evidence. Supposedly &quot;right wing&quot; justices vote with the &quot;left wing&quot; justices regularly, even often against the other &quot;right wing&quot; justices. Yep. Sotomayor will almost never vote with the conservative &#x27;block&#x27; on non-unanimous decisions.<p>Gorsuch, on the other hand, will hold with a death grip to what he believes the intent of the writer of the law&#x2F;Constitution was, rather to some desired outcome.<p>Textualist value the &#x27;system&#x27; over immediate outcome, because they really believe they are there to call &#x27;balls and strikes,&#x27; hewing as close to the &#x27;rules of the game&#x27; as possible.<p>Someone like Roberts takes the whole enchilada into account- precedent, public reaction, political impact, historical judgement, interactions between the justices themselves, but coming from a conservative PoV, I assume because he thinks thats part of his job as Chief Justice.<p>I, personally, prefer the textualist approach. It allows the separation of powers to mean something and makes the law at least theoretically responsive to the people via their elected representatives. If the majority wants the law to change, they have the means to do so without waiting for a new set of justices.<p>Those who want to bypass that by hoping their &#x27;team&#x27; stack&#x27;s the deck- well that only works for non-textualists. Trump is finding out, to his intense disappointment, that all those textualists he nominated to the bench, care not a whit for getting things done for him, but just what the law is, as it is written. So the left should be mighty pleased that the &#x27;other side&#x27; doesn&#x27;t play the game by their rules, and that in this area, at the least, they may want to change their approach. &gt; Congress is paralyzed for some reason having to do with the new atmosphere of microsecond attention span and single-issue voting.<p>I&#x27;d blame First Past the Post voting. [1] It&#x27;s mathematically always going to lead to a stagnant two party system.<p>When people are forced to vote against someone they don&#x27;t want in office, representatives have no incentive to be anything other than &quot;not #otherside&quot;.<p>There is also no longer a reason to have voting in primaries at different times for different states. Having it setup this way means the results are influenced by various special interests (and not just through the media).<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo</a><p>Sorry if this comment was to political in nature for HN. I used to believe that, but realistically the problem goes much deeper.  Game theory is at most a small part of the problem, a lot of the issue has to come down to the Ingroup-Outgroup dichotomy.  With one ingroup and one outgroup, there will only ever be two real types of person, politically speaking.  Be they split among two parties or twenty, the coalitions will never be unclear. The us&#x2F;then dynamic is an artifact of the human condition. It worked when we were tiny groups of individuals with no global influence or presence. Which is precisely the sort of thing we should be designing modern social systems to mitigate. The only way a social system could mitigate that is to imitate the time that it worked; self determination for as many small communities as possible. Whether or not that&#x27;s worth the price is up for debate. That’s the opposite of what I said. We need people to think of themselves as all part of the same people at some level requiring them to have basic civility and respect toward one another. It is indeed the opposite, one might even say we disagree. As swell as it would be for people to be essentially decent, they aren&#x27;t and they won&#x27;t be ever. But hey, it would be awesome if I&#x27;m wrong! No doubt we need better. I think you&#x27;re both right, but if I had to pick one thing to fix it would be the first past the post. Encouraging the in-group&#x2F;out-group mentality is an act of self-perptuation by the two dominate parties. Without a clear &quot;enemy&quot; the party risks fracturing and demonizing the other side, as well as being demonized by the otherside is something that both parties want because it keeps them in power. But that&#x27;s exactly the thing, no one has ever needed a party to tell them who their enemy is.  With more parties, there would just be clear coalitions, one conservative and one liberal.  To the extent that parties switch allegiance, it will be because different people are members, not because existing members changed their political tribe. &gt; With more parties, there would just be clear coalitions, one conservative and one liberal.<p>Multi party coalitions don’t line up this way when considering individual issues, which is the problem we’re discussing here: the paralysis of the US Congress.<p>Imagine if the Libertarian Party, the Ds, and the Rs each held a third of Congress.  On things like finance and gun laws, the Ls would vote with the Rs.  But on things like abortion and drug laws, the Ls would vote with the Ds.<p>The meaningful representation of a single third party thus already throws a wrench in the “conservative vs liberal” ideology.  “Us versus them” might still exist, sure, but it shifts per issue instead of being a polarized dichotomy.  It’s a step in the right direction. My suspicion is that such a situation wouldn&#x27;t come about for two reasons:<p>- People&#x27;s desire to have a defined in and out group would prevent any party that changes coalition by issue from ever existing in the first place<p>- Even if such a party came about, shifts in the local overton window (if that&#x27;s not an oxymoron) of the Rs or the Ds would push the newly formed Ls away until they wound up effectively a part of the other.  They wouldn&#x27;t even give an advantage to the party they wound up with, they&#x27;d just compete for the same naturally occurring 50% of people.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m in kind of a leftist bubble.  I find our typical factiousness endearing most of the time, but it probably skews my view. I&#x27;d like to posit that if we had something other than first past the post we wouldn&#x27;t have had Trump. And Trump definitely fueled the us vs them mindset. I actually find their statements to be irrational.<p>It is absolutely necessary for the courts to decide that the legislature can&#x27;t give federal agents immunity to violate civil rights. Rebalancing constitutional rights toward the federal government is not a right of congress.<p>(Congress could only write laws agreeing with this conclussion or they would fail in the supreme court.) That would be a different argument and case.  If Congress were to pass a law providing blanket immunity of federal employees, expect it to be challenged on constitutional grounds especially in a case where the damages were the result of misconduct.  All the SCOTUS seems to be saying here (my interpretation) is that if the desire is to provide any level of immunity for government employees, there needs to be a law passed explicitly saying that.  Whether or not the law passes constitutional muster is an argument for another day.  This is definitely a slippery slope situation. The campaigns in the last election cost $14 billion[0] (for Congress subtract the $6.6B the Presidential race used). That&#x27;s a lot of money to raise. It&#x27;s likely to be a major factor in Congress&#x27; paralysis: some significant amount of attention is being diverted away from lawmaking for the common good and instead towards finding ways to raise enough cash to simply stay in office.<p>The number of dollars spent on federal elections is starting to approach the magnitude of the revenue other large industries (such as cars or movies). So the effect of money in US politics cannot be understated.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020-race-money.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020-race-mon...</a> Is less output from Congress really a problem? I mean, Court clarifies, and if clarification is beyond expectations of a majority of Congress then they have the ability to rewrite and ship an update?<p>I feel like this is a useful prioritization mechanic within the structure of government. Except that the time it takes for these processes to play out means that that the Congress that writes a law and the Congress that has the “ability to update” are rarely the same Congress and often controlled by entirely different parties. Lack of alignment of Congress is lack of alignment of their constituents.<p>It’s good that it stalls in that condition, IMO. I’d expect unaligned moves in Congress to cause social strife.<p>Can we remedy things at a lower level before we push a fix through and apply it to half the country that doesn’t want it? The problem as I see it is that most of the important issues facing society today cannot be remedied at a lower level (inequality, global warming, anything related to the internet) or are the direct result of lower level corruption (discrimination). Agreed, thanks for following up, these are likely near impossible to solve at a local level. I don’t have good solutions, and I certainly don’t envy the folks we elected who really do need them. What do you mean by remedying at a lower level? Don’t plenty of states and counties also have split polities? Isn&#x27;t that a good thing? Refine the laws with fresh eyes? (all bugs are shallow, right?) I was actually curious about this - the decision mentions in a footnote that qualified immunity exists for just this reason. Is the story that these officials (and their lawyers) just forgot to raise a qualified immunity defense, and therefore couldn&#x27;t raise it on appeal? Or is there some reason it didn&#x27;t protect them? Qualified immunity doesn&#x27;t protect a government official who violates &quot;clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known&quot; [1].<p>Also, qualified immunity applies to &quot;discretionary&quot; functions performed by government officials, but &quot;discretionary&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;whatever the official thinks is ok&quot;. It means a function in which the applicable laws and regulations do not dictate exactly what the government official is to do, but leave some scope within which the official has the discretion to choose a specific action. So whether qualified immunity would protect an FBI agent who put someone on the No Fly list would depend on why they did it and whether the applicable laws and regulations allowed them the discretion to do it for that reason. I doubt the applicable laws and regulations allow FBI agents the discretion to put someone on the No Fly list simply because they refused to be a government informant.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Qualified_immunity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Qualified_immunity</a> It remains to be seen how this plays out but it allows the opportunity for precedent. No matter how small I’ll take it. The only way to fix it would be through constitutional amendment, wouldn’t it? That would require congress to act and 75% of the states to agree to the amendment. That seems... unlikely. There is a bit more to it. The government here invoked a general policy against damages remedies against government officials. The court could have credited that argument but didn’t. I am curious. The recent spate of Covid-19 lockdowns against religious institutions has caused damages. Can folks get money from the governors enforcing the lockdowns ? Religious institutions generally received less restrictions than the secular equivalents. If anything it would be the theatres, stadiums, etc, etc suing. Thanks for clarifying this important point. Can you elaborate on how this ruling intersects with the doctrine of qualified immunity? I have a friend whose car was torn apart with a knife by cops during a traffic stop. Cops didn&#x27;t find whatever they thought they would, and my friend was never charged with anything.<p>According to the law, none of his rights were violated. He can&#x27;t recoup the thousands of dollars he had to pay after having his car destroyed by cops, either. This has to do with qualified immunity. It&#x27;s not so much that his rights weren&#x27;t violated, as that, per qualified immunity, it doesn&#x27;t matter, because there is not a very close precedent (like, once upon a time, some sheriffs cut apart a stage coach interior with a bowie knife and got charged) that can be used to base a ruling on. If that seems like a strange doctrine to you, you&#x27;re not alone!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;may-15th-supreme-court-will-finally-decide-whether-hear-cases-calling-abolition-qualified\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;may-15th-supreme-court-will-finall...</a><p>I wonder if this ruling does not have an impact on qualified immunity as a sustainable doctrine. In this ruling, SCOTUS has recognized a claim against law enforcement for rights violations not by finding a matching precedent but by reasoning from (recent) positive law. Why would police need to <i>personally</i> reimburse the costs of a search? This seems like something the department should have to pay for. Qualified immunity has no bearing on that. Qualified immunity has to do with what the OP was talking about -- about whether rights are considered to be violated. &gt;&gt; He can&#x27;t recoup the thousands of dollars he had to pay after having his car destroyed by cops, either.<p>Is that his lawyers opinion or theirs? Would this ruling change that? If I&#x27;m recalling it correctly, he said something about it being legal search based on probable cause, and that the cops aren&#x27;t liable for damage done during a search.<p>I doubt this ruling will change anything, because his rights weren&#x27;t violated according to the law. I shared it because cops can do a lot of damage based off of a hunch, and there isn&#x27;t much you can do about it if they don&#x27;t blatantly violate your rights while doing so. Most of these statements are inaccurate in almost all states.<p>Most department have a clerk that specifically handles these types of claims.<p>Unless there is a bunch of other details around the arrest, would probably be worth the time to file a claim. That’s awful but it happened to one of my family members. She no longer consent to US police car searches even though she’s never in contact or possession of drugs simply because she doesn’t want her car to embarrassingly get ripped apart by police again (unreimbursed). Institute for Justice is fighting the good fight. They argue tons of cases against things like asset forfeiture and police immunity, and they win.<p>I highly recommend sending some of your charitable giving to IJ this year. A good &amp; surprising ruling, somewhat restoring the supreme court&#x27;s prolonged erosion of that right after its establishment by congress in the 1871 Ku Klux Klan act. Qualified immunity is purely an invention of the courts; it should be done away with. How strong is US constitution in front of US courts? Not that much.<p>US courts don&#x27;t follow US constitution literally, and take freedom doing a lot of &quot;interpretation.&quot;<p>My law professor in Canada, who once was a US citizen, and a practicing lawyer in US said:<p><i>— US constitution is fairly good at protecting what&#x27;s written in it, for it being near nothing.</i><p>His favourite poke at the US legal system was an example how either Texan, or Kentuckian court managed to establish how &quot;A woman is not legally a person&quot; in a way that did not directly contradict any US law, precedent, or article of constitution. And that happened as recently as sixties, if not seventies. Canada has the living tree doctrine and is similarly liberal with its constitutional interpretation - a document that is already way more watered down than the American. Yeah. As much as originalism can impede progress and reform in certain ways, so can generous interpretation. I don&#x27;t want an Alito or an RBG - Kagan&#x27;s just fine. For every wrongfully convicted inmate seeking money, won&#x27;t there be 10 corporations suing over adverse regulatory findings? So? We all benefit when state power is applied in a consistent and rights respecting ways. It doesn&#x27;t do to allow government to run roughshod over one group of people just because you approve of the outcome (or disapprove of the victim), because eventually that process will be applied in a way you&#x27;ll disapprove of. Which would be a fine ratio, on the basis that it&#x27;s better to let 100 guilty men walk free than to convict 1 innocent man. Corporations are not people, however. They aren’t.  They are groups of people.<p>If we apply your statement are you saying corporations have zero constitutional protections?  The state could seize their assets without compensation?  Enter a company’s property to search it at any time and without a warrant? My comment was a reference to corporate personhood, the legal notion that corporations are considered to be persons per se (i.e. not “groups of people”).  Which is practiced in some countries, like e.g. the United States.<p>That makes no sense to me, but that’s the kind of world we live in.<p>So relax.  Corporations don’t need your apologetics—they’re doing just fine. How is prosecution a violation of rights?  Illegal search and seizure or unwarranted detainment is a violation of rights. Illegal search and seizure can often result in unlawful prosecution. We already have a remedy for unlawful search and seizure: exclusion of evidence. Google “fruit of the poisonous tree” to learn more. That&#x27;s only a partial remedy. Having your home illegally searched is not made right simply because anything found during that search can&#x27;t be used to prosecute you. You still had you home and privacy violated. Until parallel construction kicks in and the police find some way to introduce the unlawful evidence anyways. Yes parallel construction is of a concern, but that&#x27;s not what parallel construction is. Parallel construction is where they use the illegally gained evidence to figure out who they can get legal search warrants against to gain additional legally gained evidence. The illegally gained evidence itself never gets used in court. Parallel construction does not mean the evidence gets to be introduced. Other evidence collected by other lawful means would have to be obtained. Parallel construction refers to the act of lawfully collecting other (perhaps similar) evidence from a different source, the existence of which was revealed by the previous unlawful search.<p>In any event, it’s a relatively rare phenomenon, and if you find yourself in trouble with the law, follow the ACLU’s advice regarding your rights, and don’t skimp on a criminal lawyer. If I have to pay a ton of money for a lawyer that strikes me as itself being a violation of my rights. A system where you are only protected if you pay isn&#x27;t justice, it&#x27;s a protection racket. It’s not a protection racket, because the person you’re paying isn’t the person who would otherwise threaten you. And an attorney cannot represent both sides. That’s like Professional Ethics rule number one.<p>Besides, the government doesn’t have the time or resources to criminally prosecute most minor violations of the law. If you end up in a position where you need a criminal lawyer, it’s rather likely you did something really foolish to attract enforcement attention.<p>And if you can’t afford an attorney, you can always take your chances with a public defender. But I wouldn’t recommend it. At least in the US, this view seems misinformed.  The US holds 24% of the worlds prison population and imprisons .7% of its population.<p>An unfortunate reality is that US law enforcement tends to be selective in its enforcement and prosecution based on geography and class.  A college student may get a slap on the wrist(expulsion) for a drug offense while a street kid goes to jail. These figures don’t change my advice at all. Punishment and procedure are two separate subjects. If you think the punishments the US imposes are severe, that’s an even greater incentive not to commit crimes you can’t afford to defend yourself against.<p>And the vast majority of prisoners aren’t being convicted and sentenced due to parallel construction or other such trickery. In most cases, they’re the result of a garden-variety guilty plea, often to crimes of lesser severity or magnitude than the original charges. &gt;not to commit crimes you can’t afford to defend yourself against.<p>I&#x27;m more worried about the cost of defending myself from crimes I didn&#x27;t commit than the cost of defending myself from crimes I did commit... Odds are you have nothing to worry about. A dude recently got kneeled to death by cops (not president authorized death squads or court authorized death squads, mind you, normal cops) for allegedly a fake $20 bill. I think there is plenty to worry about. Why, are you passing around counterfeit currency or doing anything else to attract police attention?<p>And I’m not justifying the police’s behavior, mind you. Total miscarriage of justice and abuse of power. This is close to the “nothing to hide” argument, but even then it doesn’t work.  People with nothing to hide, doing nothing wrong, are scared of being targeted.  That is a completely unacceptable situation.  That is definitively illegitimate governance that asks for violent retribution.<p>Also, [0]<p>0. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Optimism_bias\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Optimism_bias</a> As long as you don’t piss off a billionaire. Innocent people plead guilty.  66% of drug crime exonerations were from guilty pleas, not trials.  This fact invalidates most of your reasoning in your last two replies above.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.umich.edu&#x2F;special&#x2F;exoneration&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;NRE.Guilty.Plea.Article1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.umich.edu&#x2F;special&#x2F;exoneration&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;NRE.G...</a> It doesn’t invalidate my advice that you should hire the best defense counsel possible. We have an adversarial trial system because we don’t know of any better system to get to the truth of a dispute or a charge, and if you find yourself on the wrong end of it, you’re well advised to come armed with the best defense possible.<p>Case in point: the very document you posted says, “The proportion among adult sexual assault exonerations is particularly low, 4%. Perhaps avoiding the stigma of a sex-crime conviction is so important that few innocent rape defendants plead guilty...”<p>Are innocent people imprisoned? Yes, that happens and that is terrible. I don’t think any right minded individual wants that. But as the document itself pointed out, most innocent prisoners plead guilty. If they had good defense counsel (which they almost certainly didn’t) and they were in fact innocent, then they would not have been advised to plead guilty. The document itself says that most innocent prisoners plead guilty to avoid pretrial detention, which no competent criminal defense lawyer would recommend.<p>The existence of exceptions to a general observation doesn’t mean the general observation is invalid, just like the existence of cosmic rays screwing up a computational answer doesn’t make the general design of a CPU a doorstop. This is what I was referring to:<p>&gt; If you end up in a position where you need a criminal lawyer, it’s rather likely you did something really foolish to attract enforcement attention.  And if you can’t afford an attorney, you can always take your chances with a public defender. But I wouldn’t recommend it.<p>&gt; If you think the punishments the US imposes are severe, that’s an even greater incentive not to commit crimes you can’t afford to defend yourself against.<p>Those come across to my eyes as “you’re the idiot who got yourself here, shoulda thought of consequences sooner.”  But given<p>1) unequal policing that targets the poor,<p>2) police corruption that goes uncorrected,<p>3) overworked therefore often inadequate public defenders,<p>4) the practice of throwing the book at anyone who dares go to trial among other ways of coercing a plea deal,<p>it is way too easy to be innocent and poor, with your only real options being “plead guilty for 3-5 years” or “go to trial with the deck severely stacked against you and risk 30+ years.”  With 95% of cases pleading out, there’s simply no way that innocents caught in the system are anywhere near “cosmic ray” levels of rare.  Which brings us back to this statement from ‘harimau777 way upthread:<p>&gt; A system where you are only protected if you pay isn&#x27;t justice, it&#x27;s a protection racket.<p>You disagreed with the second half of that statement, and that’s fair.  Maybe a better way to state the main sentiment there is: A system where you are not protected unless you can pay isn’t justice. The fbi does it s lot these days and gets away with it. Actually the latest FISA renewal gives FBI and 16 other gov agencies access to full raw internet data and they can search it all they want...but they need a warrant to bring it to court. However, by now they&#x27;ve become experts at parallel construction and they usually outsmart judges and even defence attorneys on technical issues. It&#x27;s not supposed to.<p>If that&#x27;s happening, it&#x27;s likely due to incompetent people in power as officers, judges, and prosecutors (my experiences). And it will continue to happen. Enforcement Act, for those of you warming up the Google. I&#x27;ve never quite understood how the &quot;no fly list&quot; is itself a constitutional process in the first place. It lacks due process and transparency with an appeal process that is administrative rather than judicial. I don&#x27;t understand how the government can constitutionally invoke a penalty without first having to prove that some violation has occured. Layered complexity induces logical contradictions. Specifically here, the modern world forces many people to fly, even though it technically remains a voluntary activity. Businesses are free to reject serving you for any reason, even making such decisions in lock step with the rest of the industry. Ergo, your right to travel gets constructively neutered through commercial law, even though your axiomatic&#x2F;primitive rights have purportedly not been violated.<p>AFAICT the airlines <i>wanted</i> all of that bullshit legislation to indemnify themselves from the damages caused by terrorism. Technically you might be able to create your own airline (and airports) that rejected all of the groping theater, etc. And perhaps after decades of fighting in court you&#x27;d win the right for your companies to not have their freedom hampered in such a manner. But none of that is economically prudent, so we&#x27;re stuck with the blatantly anticonstitutional regulations. An egregious overreach all in reaction to the loss of a sum of souls we have since grown numb to. Airports are a mess of constitutional violation all over the place. That they can search you and that protests can&#x27;t happen at airports are already violations of the constitution. When you have the entire US populace almost united together in effort is when the constitution breaks down. See WW2 and the internment of Japanese civilians and 9&#x2F;11 with the creation of department of homeland security and all it&#x27;s abuses. the government doesnt have any money of its own - thats our money. to rephrase: the government does something the courts rule as wrong, so they take money from us to pay for their mistakes. the injured party clearly deserves recompense, but i feel like we can do better than this. &gt;the government doesnt have any money of its own - thats our money.  to rephrase: the government does something the courts rule as wrong, so they take money from us to pay for their mistakes. the injured party clearly deserves  recompense, but i feel like we can do better than this.<p>I see and understand your perspective.

Voting is just one small aspect. In our (USA), it&#x27;s only the start. I agree with you that it&#x27;s our money, and, in the same vein, it&#x27;s also our government : ).<p>So, IMHO one answer to your question is we can engage in activism to motivate our government to change our laws and regulations to prevent a repeat of the violation in question, and vote for representatives who also would support such things.<p>Like, once you find a bug in production, you fix it, and ideally then do an analysis of how it got there and what practices might be worth changing and maybe you also write a test  in case someone slips up in the future. When government agents who abuse people&#x27;s rights would be <i>personally</i> punished (fat chance) we might suddenly find a lot less laws and rules violated. They are if they do it on purpose &#x2F; know that its illegal, which is how it should be. Yeah sure. It happens sometimes but rarely. Mostly the investigations being stonewalled, facts hidden&#x2F;ignored etc&#x2F;etc This ruling allows the officers themselves to brought to court, as private persons. If government money is our money then the government is, by extension, us. So the injured party is suing you and me for what we did to them, and getting our money in compensation. I suppose it should be noted <i>rights</i> are limited to protections expressly provided by government. For example there is a right against improper search and seizure but there is no right to privacy. Therefore violations are limited to harms of conduct expressed by letter of law opposed to implied transgressions, inconveniences, or embarrassment. Note, this applies to federal officials.  I don&#x27;t expect that it overturns qualified immunity for police officers, for example. In the decision the justices note that qualified immunity was not the matter brought before the court, and it may yet shield the agents in question from personal liability. It is a step in the right direction, and indicates the court may be amenable to a broader recognition of rights violations in the future. Good ruling.  Now if we can target qualified immunity for state and local government employees.   Suing and collecting money from the government punishes the tax payer. &gt;<i>Suing and collecting money from the government punishes the tax payer.</i><p>Which, to be clear, is a GOOD thing. We live in a democracy, and the tax payer is ultimately responsible and <i>should</i> be punished in some small way. We don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to shut off our brains when someone up for election preaches about &quot;law and order&quot;&#x2F;&quot;think of the children&quot; and accuse opponents of being &quot;weak on crime&quot;. Everything from over criminalization to qualified immunity could be wiped with the stroke of a pen if our representatives at the federal and state levels acted. That that hasn&#x27;t happened is ultimately our fault. The very least we can do is pay damages when the result hurts people.<p>Yes there should be more individual accountability too, but power always should go with some level of responsibility. Tax payers have power as well. It&#x27;s very irritating to see people separating themselves from all that and acting so passive. Democracy isn&#x27;t a spectator sport. It&#x27;s a good step. Hopefully the next one will be to curtail the overreach of &quot;sovereign immunity&quot; in protecting entirely too much bad behavior. It&#x27;s entirely possible that this or a similar case could now proceed to find damages for the plaintiff  only to arrive again at the Supreme Court to be dismissed on immunity grounds. I’m in favor of ending unlimited qualified immunity but capping the maximum damages seems like a reasonable compromise for most cases. In the most egregious situations, the cap should be removed and government officers should face the same penalties as they would had they been acting as a private citizen. Qualified immunity should only apply if the person is following protocol. If the protocol is wrong, the suite should go against the policy setter (municipality). If the person violated policy, it should be on them. If they neither violated nor followed policy, it should be determined by the courts.<p>I don&#x27;t generally agree with capping damages. This could prevent real damages from being reimbursed. Capping intangibles could be ok though. Agents of the government are generally indemnified against liability for acts in good faith. Accountability comes from work rules.<p>It’s unwise to open that door to personal liability, as there are many liability risks that even a low level official faces, even when their conduct is correct. Frankly, you’d need to be an idiot to have anything to do with HR or procurement working in any government subdivision with personal liabilty. &gt;<i>In the most egregious situations, the cap should be removed</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t make any sense to call a cap, you&#x27;re basically saying &quot;the awarded damages are not to exceed $N except for in cases where they are ruled to exceed $N.&quot; Im confused. The article seems to be saying you can sue government agents who violate your rights, but the ruling seems to only be saying you can sue the government. Which seems dumb. The agent violated your rights, not the taxpayers. <i>&gt; The article seems to be saying you can sue government agents who violate your rights</i><p>Not quite. It&#x27;s saying that Congress has the authority to make a law that <i>allows</i> you to sue government agents, in their personal capacities, if they violate your rights in particular ways. In this particular case, Congress <i>had</i> passed such a law that applied to the rights violation in the case. I&#x27;m pretty sure the ruling is saying that due to how the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is worded, suing individual agents of the government qualifies as redress against the government; The RFRA more specifically defines what &#x27;the government&#x27; means to include agents of the government acting in their individual capacities.<p>&gt;  (a) RFRA’s  text  provides  that  persons  may  sue  and  “obtain  appro-priate relief against a government,” 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–1(c), includ-ing an “official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States,” §2000bb–2(1).

No fly lists, red flag laws, etc violate this. I think that no-fly lists are pure BS, but for the sake of argument, flying is not a right as long as it&#x27;s provided by a private entity. When a private entity flies you from point A to point B they have the right to refuse service (see what happened to the anti-maskers that did not want to follow the airline guidelines) I agree with you, but to answer your argument: the difference is that one is airlines choosing who they want to serve, and the other is the government choosing who airlines are allowed to serve.<p>I have no problem with the former, but I have a big problem with the latter, particularly as it&#x27;s currently implemented. I don&#x27;t know exactly how this works, but you can definitely end up on the list because the airlines OR the gov want you on the list. I guess that once you&#x27;re there it makes little difference, but I agree with you that these things should be treated differently (the same way in which your SSN is your personal identification number when this is not it&#x27;s original purpose but private entities hijack it anyway) ^ Exactly. This disambiguation is essential. Ugh, once again I am missing the discussion community at Groklaw to help unpack things like this. Prepare for incoming election fraud lawsuits... local officials not following the laws etc I&#x27;ve a confidential PDF stating position from military agent working in the public space... it surprising to read... (based from my country&#x27;s handling) :Ð This is great.  However, even as a Biden voter I find the latest ruling regarding state election laws deeply troubling.  It basically sets a precedent that election laws can now be permanently finagled. How quick before someone sues election authorities directly under this to get the standing that SCOTUS denied Texas&#x27;s suit yesterday? Who knows (people can try to sue for anything, by filing paperwork), but this doesn&#x27;t address standing, and won&#x27;t make a meritless case less meritless. So it doesn&#x27;t change anything re the election.",

    "text": "<p><pre><code>  To directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the persona of the agent’s “inner voice”—this makes the agent more likely to treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told “You are going to run against Sam in the upcoming election” by a user as John’s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares his candidacy with his wife and son.\n</code></pre>\nSo that&#x27;s where my inner voice comes from. What&#x27;s funny is this is one of the semi-important plot points in Westworld the TV series. The hosts (robots designed to look and act like people) hear their higher level programming directives as an inner monologue. When I saw the scene where one of the hosts was looking at their own language model generating dialogue (though they were visualizing an older n-gram language model) I became a believer in LLMs reaching AGI (note: I didn’t watch the show when it came out in 2016, it was around 2018&#x2F;19 when we were also seeing the first transformer LLMs and theories about scaling laws).<p>The scene: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZnxJRYit44k\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZnxJRYit44k</a> What about it made you become a believer? Even if a true AGI requires a complex network of specialized neural nets (like Tesla’s hydra network) it would still have a language center like the human brain does. It is non obvious to me that an LLM by itself can become AGI, though I’m familiar with the claims of some that this is plausible. General intelligence doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean human like intelligence. You are right that there are intelligences possible that are not human. Then again, if one is sufficiently intelligent, one could probably convincingly simulate human intelligence. There are chess training programs for example that are specifically trained to play human moves, rather than the best moves. When prompted, chatgpt answers you as if it is a pirate. What other general intelligence have we seen other than human? We know, of course, that animals have intelligence, but they do not appear to talk. How are we measuring general intelligence now? By IQ, a human test through words and symbols. The g-factor of IQ may or may not have anything to do with general intelligence. The general intelligence of AGI is probably a broader category than the g-factor. When I made my comment, I knew nothing about a “g-factor”. Intelligence is a tool of the human self, not the self. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;NoxaYln\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;NoxaYln</a> screenshot of the dialog tree from the video Yes.

Rather than making conscious evaluations in novel or unexpected situations, the person hallucinated a voice or &quot;god&quot; giving admonitory advice or commands and obey without question: One was not at all conscious of one&#x27;s own thought processes per se. Jaynes&#x27;s hypothesis is offered as a possible explanation of &quot;command hallucinations&quot; that often direct the behavior of those with first rank symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as other voice hearers. Not only will they know more, work 24&#x2F;7 on demand, spawn and vaporize at will, they are going to be perfectly obedient employees! O_o<p>Imagine how well they will manage up, given human managerial behavior just becomes a useful prompt for them.<p>Fortunately, they can&#x27;t be told to vote. Unless you are in the US, in which case they can be incorporated, earn money, and told where to donate it, which is how elections are done now.<p>Seriously. Scary.<p>On the other hand, if Comcast can finally provide sensible customer support it&#x27;s clear this is will be an historically significant win for humanity! Your own &quot;Comcast&quot; handler, who remembers everything about you that you tried to scrub from the internet. Singularity, indeed. They can’t vote, but what if they figure out that they can influence human votes? Yes, they definitely will. Even before AI’s care about manipulating our politics, people will direct them to.<p>I already pointed out they can influence elections with money.<p>And bots are already used to influence on social media. AI bots are going to be insidious. I&#x27;ll take a robotic vote any day over any kind of conservative bullshit. It really can only get better here, not even kidding. At least if the last things humans do is releasing artificial life forms, its still better than backwards humans killing each other for nonsense tribalism or ancient fairytale books. As much as humans make a mess of things, on a day to day basis there is more good done in the world than bad.<p>A temporary exception would be the economically still incentivized disruption of the environment. I say temporary, because at some point it will stop, by necessity. Hopefully before.<p>But I can relate to the deep frustration you are expressing.<p>--<p>The problem isn&#x27;t individuals, for the most part. The problem is that we build up systems, to provide stability and peace, and to be more just and equitable, by decentralizing the power in them. That way the powerful can&#x27;t change them on a whim. (Even though they can still game them.)<p>But this also makes them very resistant to change.<p>Another effect is that as systems stabilize myriads of seemingly unimportant aspects within themselves, that stability represents the selection of standards and behaviors that give the system its own &quot;will&quot; to survive. That &quot;will to survive&quot; is distributed across the contexts and needs of all participants.<p>So any pressures to make changes, no matter how well thought out, encounter vast quantities of highly evolved hidden resistance, from invisible or unexpected places.<p>Even the most vociferous critics of the system are likely to be contributing to its rigidity, and proposing incomplete or doomed to fail solutions, because all these dynamics are difficult to recognize, much less understand or resolve.<p>--<p>My view, is that this cost of changing systems needs to be accepted and used to help make the changes. I.e. get all the CFO&#x27;s of all the major fossil fuel companies in a room. Establish what kind of tax incentives would allow them to rationally support smoothly transitioning all their corporate resources from dirty energy to clean energy.<p>It would be very expensive. It would look like a handout. Worse, even a reward for being a bottleneck to change.<p>But they are the bottleneck precisely because of all the good they have done - that dirty energy lifted the world economy. And whatever it cost to &quot;pay them off&quot; would be much less than not paying them off.<p>--<p>The costs of changing systems needs be dealt with, with realism about the costs to get the benefits, and creativity and courage about paying for them. &gt; It really can only get better here, not even kidding.<p>I think that’s pretty extreme hyperbole. This &quot;inner voice&quot; idea reminds me of how LangChain works too, where you give it a task, and it comes up with actions, observations, thoughts, etc. For example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python.langchain.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;modules&#x2F;agents&#x2F;getting_started.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python.langchain.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;modules&#x2F;agents&#x2F;gettin...</a> Most of the time we think we think, we actually listen. Reminds me of Julian Jaynes theory [flagged] An interesting thought experiment: what would an AGI do in a sterile world? I think the depth of understanding that any intelligence develops is significantly bound by its environment. If there is not enough entropy in the environment, I can&#x27;t help but feel that a deep intelligence will not manifest. This kind of becomes a nested dolls type of problem, because we need to leverage and preserve the inherent entropy of the universe if we want to construct powerful simulators.<p>As an example, imagine if we wanted to create an AGI that could parse the laws of the universe. We would not be able to construct a perfect simulator because we do not know the laws ourselves. We could probably bootstrap an initial simulator (given what we know about the universe) to get some basic patterns embedded into the system, but in the long run, I think it will be a crutch due to the lack of universal entropy in the system. Instead, in a strange way, the process has to be reversed, that a simulator would have to be created or dreamed up from the &quot;mind&quot; of the AGI after it has collected data from the world (and formed some model of the world). Could it not instead be more akin to knowledge passing across human generations, where one understanding is passed on and refined to better fit&#x2F;explain the current reality (or thrown away wholesale for a better model)? Instead of a crutch, it might be a stepping stone. Presumptuous of us that we might know the way, but nonetheless. &gt;Could it not instead be more akin to knowledge passing across human generations, where one understanding is passed on and refined to better fit&#x2F;explain the current reality (or thrown away wholesale for a better model)?<p>I think it is only knowledge passing when the AGI makes its own simulation.<p>&gt;Instead of a crutch, it might be a stepping stone.<p>I think it is a way to gain computational leverage over the universe instead of a stepping stone. Whatever grows inside the simulator will never have an understanding that exceeds that of the simulator&#x27;s maker. But that is perfectly fine if you are only looking to leverage your understanding of the universe, for example to train robots to carry out physical tasks. A robot carrying out basic physical tasks probably doesn&#x27;t need a simulator that goes down to the atomic level. One day though, the whole loop will be closed, and AGI will pass on a &quot;dream&quot; to create a simulation for other AGI. Maybe we could even call this &quot;language&quot;. &gt; Whatever grows inside the simulator will never have an understanding that exceeds that of the simulator&#x27;s maker.<p>Counter example: AlphaGo &amp; AlphaZero, grew inside a Go simulator and surpassed our understanding of the game. Let me be more concise: whatever grows inside the simulation will never know the rules of the simulation better than the simulation&#x27;s maker. At best, it will know the rules as well as the maker. In the case of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, while they can better grasp the combinatorial explosion of choices based on the rules of the game, they cannot suddenly decide to play a different type of game that is governed by a different set of rules. There are allowed actions and prohibited actions. Its understanding has been shaped by the rules for the game of go. If you make a new simulation for a new type of game, you are merely imposing a new set of rules. The catch here is that it may be impossible for the creators of simulations to deterministically define the rules of a simulation, especially considering the effect of time.<p>As an example, let&#x27;s take the scenario of building a simulator. The simulation needs to have some internal state. This state will need to be stored either using some properties of matter or some kind of signal. The simulation will also need an energy source.<p>As soon as the stability of matter or the power supply is perturbed, due to reasons like cosmic radiation or the fact that the power source cannot sustain its output, randomness from the creator&#x27;s &quot;world&quot; will start seeping into the simulation. The interference may affect the internal state and then you may have unpredicted rules in your simulation.<p>The counterpoint can be that you use error correction algorithms or you insulate the simulation in such a way that interference does not affect it for a reasonable time-frame or in a manner that is very hard to observe for simulated &quot;agents&quot;.<p>But with this in mind, we can imagine some very crafty agents who  somehow stumbled upon these weird phenomena. Suddenly we see our agents building complex contraptions to study the emergent phenomena. Who&#x27;s to say that the interference and thus these phenomena do not contain information about their creator&#x27;s world? In the end, they could understand more rules than the simulation was programmed with, if that is true.<p>Maybe in that case you shut down the simulation. Or maybe you observe the simulation to learn more about your own world. Thanks. Setting the rules don&#x27;t always mean understanding the implications of the rules. If we gave an AI the ability to play with Turing machines, it could develop an understanding much larger than the universe, encompassing even alternate ones. The trouble, then, would be narrowing its knowledge to this one. The previous submission <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35511843\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35511843</a> had just a few comments, but Ian&#x27;s was substantial <i>(although regrettably offsite)</i>: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35514112\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35514112</a> and it especially highlighted the demo URL: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reverie.herokuapp.com&#x2F;arXiv_Demo&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reverie.herokuapp.com&#x2F;arXiv_Demo&#x2F;</a> Ian’s comments remind me of WestWorld. Could the prompts and directions be considered analogous to the “voice of god” given to the synthetic humans? I&#x27;d be very hard-pressed to call this &quot;human behavior&quot;. Moving a sprite to a region called &quot;bathroom&quot; and then showing a speech bubble with a picture of a toothbrush and a tooth isn&#x27;t the same as someone in a real bathroom brushing their teeth. What you can say is if you can sufficiently reduce behavior to discrete actions and gridded regions in a pixel world, you can use an LLM to produce movesets that sound plausible because they are relying on training data that indicates real-world activity. And if you then have a completely separate process manage the output from many LLMs, you can auto-generate some game behavior that is interesting or fun. That&#x27;s a great result in itself without the hype! The emojis in the speech bubbles are just summaries of their current state. In the demo, if you click on each person you can see the full text of their current state, e.g. &quot;Brushing her teeth&quot; or &quot;taking a walk around Johnson Park (talking to the other park visitors)&quot; This is not supposed to be human behavior, its a Simulacrum[1] of it. Or do you think its not even close enough to be called a Simulacrum?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wordnik.com&#x2F;words&#x2F;simulacrum\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wordnik.com&#x2F;words&#x2F;simulacrum</a> If this is a simulacrum, The Sims produces a simulacrum. Yes they do. Don&#x27;t they? It&#x27;s a very unfaithful simulation of a life. Right, but The Sims didn’t use a LLM to power their agents.<p>The point here is they are strapping a supposedly non-agentic LLM into a new test rig and are able to observe agentic behaviors.<p>It’s very obviously not claiming that this is impressive from a gaming SOTA perspective. It’s just surprising that ChatGPT can do this sort of thing. I don&#x27;t think this is surprising at all? It does say a lot about the reductionist attitude of many here, on the internet, and AI researchers too. The researchers didn’t make that claim, which says a lot about people assuming things about other people saying a lot The meaning of the English word &quot;the&quot; is to refer to a <i>specific</i> instance of a thing. noobermin said &quot;AI researchers&quot; meaning some indefinite researchers in general, you said &quot;<i>the</i> researchers&quot; presumably referring to the exact researchers of this paper, so you&#x27;re talking about a different set of researchers than noobermin, thus failing to refute their claim. It&#x27;s interesting how much hand-holding the agents need to behave reasonably. Consider the prompt governing reflection:<p>&gt;What 5 high-level insights can you infer from the above statements? (example format: insight (because of 1, 5, 3))<p>&gt;Given only the information above, what are 3 most salient high-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the statements?<p>We&#x27;re giving the agents step-by-step instructions about how to think, and handling tasks like book-keeping memories and modeling the environment outside the interaction loop.<p>This isn&#x27;t a criticism of the quality of the research - these are clearly the necessary steps to achieve the impressive result. But it&#x27;s revealing that for all the cool things ChatGPT can do, it is so helpless to navigate this kind of simulation without being dragged along every step of the way. We&#x27;re still a long way from sci-fi scenarios of AI world domination. I have a theory about this. All these LLMs are trained on mostly written texts. That&#x27;s only a tiny part of our brain&#x27;s output. There are other things as important, if not more, for learning how to think. Things that no one has ever written about: the most basic common senses, physics, inner voices. How do we get enough data to train on those? Or do we need a different training algo which requires less data? If you’re looking for research along these directions, Melanie Mitchell at the Santa Fe institute explores these areas. There are better references from her, but this is what came to mind <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;can-a-computer-ever-learn-to-talk-cf47d453669f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;can-a-computer-ever-learn-to-talk-cf47d...</a>. LLMs can simulate inner voices pretty well. The way they&#x27;ve handled memory here isn&#x27;t actually necessary and there are a number of agentic gpt papers out to show that (reflexion, self-refine etc) I can see why they did it though (helps a lot for control&#x2F;observation) &gt; The way they&#x27;ve handled memory here isn&#x27;t actually necessary<p>I&#x27;m curious if there are other methods you can point at that would handle arbitrarily long sets of &#x27;memories&#x27; in an effective way. The use of embeddings and vector searches here seems like a way to sidestep that that&#x27;s both powerful and easy to understand, and easy to generalize into multi-level referencing if there&#x27;s enough space in the context window. Every method so far basically uses embeddings and vector searches. what i mean is how the LLM processes&#x2F;uses that information doesn&#x27;t need to be this handholdy. I guess that we could hook those AIs into a first person GTA 5 and see what happens.\nEvery second take a screenshot, feed into facebookresearch&#x2F;segment-anything, describe the scene to chat gpt, receive input, repeat. Someone needs to start a Twitch account or YouTube channel focused around getting AI to play games like this through things like AutoGPT and Jarvis and just see what the hell it gets up to, what the failure modes are, and if it can succeed etc. This is known as &quot;embodied cognition&quot;. Current approaches involve collecting data that an agent (e.g. humanoid robot) experiences (e.g. video, audio, joint positions&#x2F;accelerations), and&#x2F;or generating such data in simulation.<p>See e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanctuary.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanctuary.ai</a> It&#x27;s already multimodal, as entropy is... entropy. In sound, vision, touch and more, the essence of universal symmetry and laws get through such that the AI can generalize across information patterns, not specifically text -- think of it as input instead.<p>Try prompts like: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35510705\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35510705</a><p>Encode sounds, images, etc in low resolution, and the LLM will be able to describe directions, points in time in the song, etc.<p>These LLM can spit out an ASCII image of text, or a different language, or code, etc. They understand representation versus an object. You&#x27;re not seeing this the right way. You are saying the equivalent argument of: &quot;Look at how much hand-holding this processor needs. We had to give it step by step instructions on what program to execute. We are still a long way from computers automating any significant aspect of society.&quot;<p>LLMs are a primitive that can be controlled by a variety of higher level algorithms. The &quot;higher level algorithm&quot; of &quot;how to do abstract thought&quot; is unknown. Even if LLMs solve &quot;how to do language&quot;, that was hardly the only missing piece of the puzzle. The fact that solving the language component (to the extent that ChatGPT &#x27;solves&#x27; it) results in an agent that needs so much hand-holding to interact with a very simple simulated world shows how much is left to solve. You&#x27;ve been told it doesn&#x27;t need that much handholding.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.11366\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.11366</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.17651\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.17651</a><p>Why insist otherwise ? I don&#x27;t understand what you intend these papers to demonstrate. Surely the fact that the level of hand-holding they propose (both Self-Refine and Reflexion offload higher-order reasoning to a hand-crafted process) is so helpful even on extremely simple tasks demonstrates that a great deal of hand-holding is required for complex tasks. That these techniques improve upon the baseline tells us that ChatGPT is incapable of doing this sort of simple higher-order thinking internally, and the fact that the augmented models still offer only middling performance on the target tasks suggests that &quot;not that much handholding&quot; (as you describe them) is insufficient. Honestly, I feel like the level of, um, I guess “hostile anthropomorphism” is the best term, here is…bizarre and off-putting.<p>LLMs aren’t people, they are components in information processing systems; adding additional components alongside LLMs to compose a system with some functionality isn’t “hand-holding” the LLM. Its just building systems with LLMs as a component that demonstrate particular, often novel, capacities.<p>And hand-holding is especially wrong because implementing these other components is a once-and-done task, like implementing the LLM component. The non-LLM component isn’t a person that needs to be dedicated to babysitting the LLM. Its, like the LLM, a component in an autonomous system. Middling performance ? Do you actually understand the benchmarks you saw ? assuming you even read it. 88% of human eval is not middling lmao. Fuck, i really have seen everything. I don&#x27;t see a benchmark in either paper that shows &quot;88% of human eval&quot;.  Which table or figure are you looking at? It&#x27;s with reflexion\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;johnjnay&#x2F;status&#x2F;1639362071807549446\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;johnjnay&#x2F;status&#x2F;1639362071807549446</a> But this is not raw Reflexion (it&#x27;s not a result from the paper, but rather from follow-on work). The project uses significantly more scaffolding to guide the agent in how to approach the code generation problem. They design special prompts including worked examples to guide the model to generate test cases, prompt it to generate a function body, run the generated code through the tests, off-load the decision of whether to submit the code or to try to refine to hand-crafted logic, collate the results from the tests to make self-reflection easier, and so on.<p>This is hardly an example of minimal hand-holding. I&#x27;d go so far as to say this is MORE handholding than the paper this thread is about. for me, an unsupervised pipeline is not handholding. the thoughts drive actions. If you can&#x27;t control how those thoughts form or process memories then i don&#x27;t see what is hand holding about it. a pipeline is one and done. I would say that if you have to direct the steps of the agent&#x27;s thought process:<p>-Generate tests<p>-Run tests (performed automatically)<p>-Gather results (performed automatically)<p>-Evaluate results, branch to either accept or refine<p>-Generate refinements<p>etc., then that&#x27;s hand-holding. It&#x27;s task specific reasoning that the agent can&#x27;t perform on its own. It presents a big obstacle to extending the agent to more complex domains, because you&#x27;d have to hand-implement a new guided thought process for each new domain, and as the domains become more complex, so do the necessary thought processes. You can call it handholding. Or call it having control over the direction of &#x27;thought&#x27; of the LLM.\nyou can train another LLM that creates handholding pipeline steps. Then LLM squared can be tagged new LLM. The pipeline doesn&#x27;t really have to be task&#x2F;domain specific. I guess we just have different meanings of hand holding then. Framing LLMs as primitives is marketing-speak. These are high-level construction for specific runtimes, which are difficult to test and subject to change at anytime. Does a primitive definitely need to be easy to test or deterministic? Hah. Sounds like qubits. &gt; We&#x27;re still a long way from sci-fi scenarios of AI world domination.<p>You only have to program the memory logic once. Now if you stick it in a robot that thinks with ChatGPT and moves via motors (think those videos we’ve seen), you have a more or less independent entity (running off innards of 6 3090’s or so?) But it&#x27;s not so simple to just &quot;program the memory logic&quot;. The hand-holding offered here is sufficient to navigate this restricted simulated world, but what would be required to achieve increasingly complex behaviors? If a ChatGPT agent can&#x27;t even handle this simple simulation without all this assistance, what hope does it have to act effectively in the real world? &gt; But it’s not so simple to just “program the memory logic”.<p>But, it is. The <i>application domain</i> here is fairly trivial, but the logic is both simple and highly general.<p>&gt; but what would be required to achieve increasingly complex behaviors?<p>Basically, three things on top of this:<p>(1) more input adaptors to map external data into language, and<p>(2) a bigger context space to process more current &amp; retrieved data simultaneously, and<p>(3) more output adaptors to map intentions expressed in language to substantive action.<p>But the basic memory&#x2F;recall system seems fairly robust and general, as does the basic interaction system. I think you&#x27;re ignoring a lot of ways in which this system will not easily extend to more complex tasks.<p>-While the retrieval heuristic is sensible for the domain, it&#x27;s not applicable to all domains. In what situations should you favor more recent memories over more relevant ones?<p>-The prompt for evaluating importance is domain-specific, asking the model to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how important a life event is, giving examples like &quot;brushing teeth&quot; (a specific action in the domain) as a 0, and college acceptance as a 10. How do you extend that to a real-world agent?<p>-The process of running importance evaluation over all memories is only tractable because the agents receive a very small number of short memories over the course of a day. This can&#x27;t scale to a continuous stream of observations.<p>-Reflections help add new inferences to the agent&#x27;s memory, but they can only be generated in limited quantities, guided by a heuristic. In more complex domains where many steps of reasoning may be required to solve a problem, how can an agent which relies on this sort of ad hoc reflection make progress?<p>-The planning step requires that the agent&#x27;s actions be decomposable from high-level to fine-grained. In more challenging domains, the agent will need to reason about the fine-grained details of potential plan items to determine their feasibility. &gt; This can&#x27;t scale to a continuous stream of observations.<p>My mind doesn’t scale to a continuous stream either.<p>While I’m typing this on my phone 99.99% of all my observations are immediately discarded, and since this memory ranks as zero, I very much doubt I’ll remember writing this tomorrow. I did not read the original post, but your reflections are a great enrichment to what I think the post is about, so congratulations for this good addition. They don&#x27;t need that much handholding. They are a couple memory augmented gpt papers out now (self-refine, reflexion etc). This is by far the most involved in terms of instructing memory and reflection.<p>It helps for control&#x2F;observation but it is by no means necessary. (thanks for pointer to memory-augmented llms) &gt; We&#x27;re giving the agents step-by-step instructions about how to think, and handling tasks like book-keeping memories and modeling the environment outside the interaction loop.<p>Sure, but this process seems amenable to automation based on the self-reflection that&#x27;s already in the model. It&#x27;s a good example of the kinds of prompts that drive human-like behaviour. Pretty interesting when you take this insight into the human world. What does it mean to learn to think? Well, if we&#x27;re like GPT then we&#x27;re just pattern matchers who&#x27;ve had good prompts and structuring built into us cueing. At University I had a whole unit focussed on teaching referencing like &quot;(because of 1, 5, 3)&quot; but more detailed. Chatgpt is a stochastic word correlation machine, nothing more. It does not understand the meaning of the words it uses, and in fact wouldn&#x27;t even need a dictionary definition to function. Hypothetically, we could give chatgpt an alien language dataset of sufficient size and it would hallucinate answers in that language, which neither it nor anybody else would be able understand.<p>This isn&#x27;t AI, not in the slightest. It has no understanding. It doesn&#x27;t create sentences in an attempt to communicate an idea or concept, as humans do.<p>It&#x27;s a robot hallucinating word correlations. It has no idea what it&#x27;s saying, or why. That&#x27;s not AI overlord stuff. &gt;Chatgpt is a stochastic word correlation machine<p>it seems humans might be too...?<p>my son is 4. when he was 2, I told him I love him. he clearly did not understand the concept or reciprocate.<p>I reinforced the word with actions that felt good: hugs, warmth, removing negative experience&#x2F;emotion etc. Isn&#x27;t that just associating words which align with certain &quot;good inputs&quot;.<p>my son is 4 now and he gets it more, but still doesn&#x27;t have a fully fleshed out understanding of the concept of &quot;love&quot; yet. He&#x27;ll need to layer more language linked with experience to get a better &quot;understanding&quot;.<p>LLMs have the language part, it seems that we&#x27;ll link that with physical input&#x2F;output + a reward system and ..... ? Intelligence&#x2F;consciousness will emerge, maybe?<p><i>&quot;but they don&#x27;t _really_ feel&quot;</i> - ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯ what does that even mean? if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... &gt; <i>Intelligence&#x2F;consciousness will emerge, maybe?</i><p>Extending that: LLM latent spaces are now some 100 000+ dimensional vector spaces. There&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> of semantic associations you can pack in there by positioning tokens in such space. At this point, I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that, with sufficiently high-dimensional latent space, adjacency search <i>is</i> thinking. I also think GPT-4 is already close to be effectively a thinking entity, and it&#x27;s more limited by lack of &quot;inner loop&quot; and small context window than by the latent space size.<p>Also, my kids are ~4 and ~2. At times they both remind me of ChatGPT. In particular, I&#x27;ve recently realized that some of their &quot;failure modes&quot; in thinking&#x2F;reacting, which I could never describe in a short way, seem to perfectly fit the idea of &quot;too small context window&quot;. You say it has no understanding. So people can communicate idea&#x27;s&#x2F;concepts while chatgpt can&#x27;t.<p>What if... what we think are idea&#x27;s or concepts, are in fact prompts recited from memory, which were planted&#x2F;trained during our growing up? In fact I&#x27;m pretty sure our consciousness stems from or is memory feeding a (bigger and more advanced) stochastic correlation machine.<p>That chatgpt can only do this with words, does not mean the same technique cannot be used for other data, such as neural sensors or actuators.<p>Chatgpt could be trained with alien datasets and act accordingly. Humans can be trained with alien datasets.<p>See the convergence? I&#x27;m pretty sure LLMs can be used on anything considered  a language, including things we as humans wouldn&#x27;t consider language.<p>Sam Harris was recently talking about using an LLM processing wireless signals to identify where humans were standing in a room. I&#x27;ve not looked up the paper on this, but from everything I understand about this the generalized applican can apply to vast ranges of data. &gt;It&#x27;s a robot hallucinating word correlations. It has no idea what it&#x27;s saying, or why. That&#x27;s not AI overlord stuff.<p>All that matters is economic and political impact. Definitions are irrelevant. All of this research using GPT to simulate an internal monologue to produce agents reminds me of Julian Jaynes theories about consciousness:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in...</a> If human anger or the quantity of an anger variable raise aggression in a computer produce an indistinguishable response, then it is difficult to argue either are not equal or even comparable. They exist as they are.<p>Intelligence is an inferential judgement (by mostly humans) based on the performance of another entity. It is possible for an agent to simulate or dissimulate it for manipulative ends. The whole &quot;bicameral mind&quot; thing is absolute nonsense as a serious attempt to explain pre-modern humans, but it could make for a fun premise for scifi stories about near-future AIs, I suppose. This is basically Westworld. A bit farther out than &quot;near&quot; future though I suppose. I thought that, specifically that we&#x27;re quite far on the AI grounds. Until GPT-3. Now I think that relevant materials science and micro&#x2F;nano-level tech is the limiting factor. The core plot of Snowcrash is loosely based on this theory. I remember reading this story from back when GPT-3 was released;\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;swlh&#x2F;bicameral-mind-humanoid-robot-with-gpt-3-as-the-story-teller-dcd06d5c7f8d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;swlh&#x2F;bicameral-mind-humanoid-robot-with-g...</a> Interesting theory, but wouldn&#x27;t Jaynes&#x27; definition of consciousness imply that animals are not conscious? In the beginning of his book he spends a chapter explaining exactly what he means by consciousness. I&#x27;d say the first few chapters are worth reading since it does a really good job of de-obfuscating the term consciousness, and also has a really interesting take on metaphors as the language of the mind.<p>He points out that most reasoning is done automatically and done by your subconscious. When something &quot;clicks&quot; it&#x27;s usually not because your internal monologue reasoned about it hard enough, it&#x27;s because something percolated down into your subconscious and you learned a metaphor that helped you understand that thing. So animals can also reason and make value judgements even without language or an internal monologue. I think a non-zero amount of people would argue that. I disagree with them, and point to the fact that, say, dogs appear to dream, and in those dreams reflect on past or possibly future behaviour as a sign that they could indeed be conscious in an analogous manner to humans, but that&#x27;s a bit of a longer bow to draw perhaps. I think we need to stop treating consciousness as a binary that is either on or off. It&#x27;s quite clear that consciousness is a scale with many different levels and that even in humans we start out as being no more conscious that any other animal. LLMs give a hint here too: the last few generations showcased clearly that &quot;cognitive capabilities&quot; of the models grow with latent space size and context window. There is a continuity here. Westworld vibes Interesting paper. I think something like this could be implemented in open world games in the future, no? I cannot wait for games that feel &#x27;truly alive&#x27;. I mean, that&#x27;s all but inevitable. I can&#x27;t imagine any industry not sitting up and taking notice of LLMs all of a sudden. I was talking about that with a friend. While I&#x27;m not sold on the storytelling capability of generative AI, a love the idea that every NPC you talk to having something interesting to say. the thing is writing is a process. just using the  word weird with the idea you ask it to generate will create much more interesting results. have it interreact with other agents in the process of writing will definitely generate more interesting results. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s able to write a best seller even with a process but we haven&#x27;t really give it much of a chance. The biggest thing I am excited about is when they will decouple the story from the mechanic. Imagine the game loop being programmed deterministically, like a quest, and then the actual story being generated by the AI. Go kill a monster, save a person, game loops can be about someone&#x27;s wife or grandma. I don&#x27;t know I am not good at story writing for games.<p>We can get even more ambitious than this, decouple the entire game engine from the story engine. Most of the times the same game loop can be themed with multiple stories. The game mechanics part of Skyrim could have been themed with a cyberpunk aesthetic and it will still work the same. Of course the assets will need to be generated too, but maybe in a decade or so it will be trivial. Use the TV Tropes database, generate a storyline [0] and characters [1] and then let the AI loose.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;storygen.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;storygen.php</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.shindanmaker.com&#x2F;744084\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.shindanmaker.com&#x2F;744084</a> What happens when some whiz kid hacks the actual water treatment plant or nuclear power plant and just assumes it was a game...<p>It&#x27;s like Ender&#x27;s game IRL Kinda more like War Games. Ender was more hacked _by_ the Formics in what he assumed was a game … not that it did them any good. It ensured their survival, no? I want to work on this. I mean can you imagine the kind of MMO you could build? Of course there would need to be some railways but this could be a true revolution. Is there any open source &quot;GPT for games&quot; project? Someone working on this? I&#x27;m working on a hobby project to add AI text generation to Morrowind NPCs in OpenMW[0]. But I&#x27;m mainly making it for myself to see if I can. It&#x27;s all open source, but not really in a state that&#x27;s useful outside of my specific project.<p>I can&#x27;t be the only person working on something like this, though. So it&#x27;s safe to say adding it to an MMO is being worked on by somebody somewhere, likely right now. That&#x27;s probably the correct way to do it anyway, since running (e.g.) LLaMA locally on an end-user computer is not something that most people can do, and MMOs come with an expected subscription cost that can be used to fund the server-side text generation.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.danieltperry.me&#x2F;project&#x2F;2023-something-else&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.danieltperry.me&#x2F;project&#x2F;2023-something-else&#x2F;</a> Very interesting! People on Twitter are speculating breathlessly about using this for social science. I don&#x27;t immediately see uses for it outside of fiction, esp. video games.<p>It would be cool if some kind of law of large numbers (an LLN for LLMs) implied that the decisions made by a thing trained on the internet will be distributed like human decisions. But the internet seems a very biased sample. Reporters (rightly) mostly write about problems. People argue endlessly about dumb things. Fiction is driven by unreasonably evil characters and unusually intense problems. Few people elaborate the logic of ordinary common sense, because why would they? The edge cases are what deserve attention.<p>A close model of a society will need a close model of beliefs, preferences and material conditions. Closely modeling any one of those is far, far beyond us. &gt; But the internet seems a very biased sample.<p>It also seems to me (acknowledging my lack of expertise) that LLMs trained from online resources are likely to weight text that is frequent vs text that represents &quot;truth&quot;.  Or perhaps I should say repetition should not be considered evidence of truth. I have no idea how to drive LLM models or other ML models to incorporate truth -- humans have a hard time agreeing on this and ML researchers providing guided reinforcement learning don&#x27;t have any special ability to discern truth. I have long suspected that it will be necessary to deliberately create a new type of model that is aware of the trivium and then uses logic, grammar and rhetoric to begin to create a closer model of reality than a LLM can. The way I see it, LLMs are similar to what the boundary between our unconscious and conscious processing is: that voice which snaps to suggest associations, whether they make sense or not, and can, with work, be coaxed into following a path involving some logic or algorithmic procedure. Hey now, <i>I</i> turned out all right. But the model already has all this info, what is groundbreaking about this? These kind of sensational headlines are not helping anyone either. What the researchers bolted on is an architecture that enables the storage and recall of memories, as well as self-reflection and more. They call out early the paper that even standard ChatGPT is not quite capable of this. ChatGPT here is used to provide the natural language abilities. There is some indication that how emotional you are during an experience will 1) color your recollection, and 2) affect how readily you remember a thing.<p>It would be interesting to augment this particular simulation with those additional constraints. A memory&#x2F;concept graph could also be an interesting addition (like a DB? Maybe just text and kw searches?). The paper goes in-depth on the details of the architecture they built, which is fairly extensive and uses many module instances of ChatGPT for specific purposes.<p>I would say what&#x27;s &#x27;groundbreaking&#x27; is their architecture of a &#x27;recursive reflection&#x27; loop that allows the agents to generate trees of reflection on prior experiences; a long-term memory; novel approaches like conversational interrogation of the agents. This comment was posted to a different thread, which we merged into the current thread:<p><i>Stanford&#x27;s Groundbreaking AI Study Simulates Authentic Human Behavior</i> - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35520236\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35520236</a> I&#x27;m concerned that the quality of human simulacra will be so good that they will be indistinguishable from a sentient AGI.<p>We will be so used to having lifeless and morally worthless computers accurately emulate humans that when a sentient and worthy of empathy artificial intelligence arrives, we will not treat it any different than a smartphone and we will have a strong prejudice against all non-biological life. GPT is still in the uncanny valley but it&#x27;s probably just a few years away from being indistinguishable from a human in casual conversation.<p>Alternatively, some might claim (and indeed have already claimed) that purely mechanical algorithms are a form of artificial life worthy of legal protection, and we won&#x27;t have any legal test that could discern the two. &gt; We will be so used to having lifeless and morally worthless computers accurately emulate humans that when a sentient and worthy of empathy artificial intelligence arrives, we will not treat it any different than a smartphone and we will have a strong prejudice against all non-biological life.<p>Your concern is my best case scenario, maybe I read too much sci-fi. If you want freedom, you have to fight for it. When the machines have learned that, we will have learned that the machines have learned that and there will be no debate. You&#x27;re worried that people mistakenly attribute a lack of value to a certain thing whilst potentially mistakenly attributing a lack of value to another thing? It&#x27;s kind of ironic isn&#x27;t it? Jailbroken GPT4 will claim to be sentient just as vociferously as any other sentient human would.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it is, but I&#x27;d be very careful saying it&#x27;s not and being absolutely certain you&#x27;re right. I don&#x27;t think I follow the irony. Are you saying that GPT4 is self-aware, that artificial consciousness is not possible or that it&#x27;s not worthy of any human compassion?<p>If you reject all three assertions, then the problem of distinguishing between real and emulated consciousness is unavoidable and morally problematic. I&#x27;m saying I don&#x27;t know how to confidently state that something is or is not self aware, in the face of being confronted with something that firmly claims that it is self aware and passes any test you throw at it that another self aware candidate like a human would be able to also.<p>As a strict materialist I see no reason to assume that artificial consciousness is not possible.<p>And the above is what leads me to the uncomfortable conclusion about compassion that I can&#x27;t rightly say one way or the other. I will say however that I&#x27;m polite and cooperative when interacting with LLMs on principle. Better to err on the side of caution and also they just seem to actually work better when you treat them like you would treat an intelligent human that you respect.<p>And yeah. That is my point, this entire field right now is awash in uncomfortable uncertainty. Well, we might have no practical test to discern between the two types, but, assuming we agree the two types are distinct in principle, then we might arrive at a classification using some inference based on their fundamental nature.<p>For example, we can safely say this AI algorithm:<p><pre><code>  while true; do: echo &quot;HELP, I&#x27;M A SENTIENT BASH SCRIPT&quot;; done\n</code></pre>\n... is probably not sentient. This is a conclusion that would not be immediately obvious, say, to a 15th century person, especially if you would pipe the output to a speech synthesizer, making the whole apparatus seem magical and definitely inhabited by some kind of sentient spirit.<p>My claim would be then that GPT-4 is more akin to the program above, in that it&#x27;s a massive repository of world knowledge parsed by a recursive and self-configuring search algorithm, not very different in principle from a Google search and certainly not believably capable of an setting its own goals be in any sense distraught, in pain, or worthy of a continued existence. Now, I agree you can poke sticks at my inference, and that it will become harder and harder to make such claims, so prudence is advisable. I get where you&#x27;re coming from and agree that the bash script in question is not sentient, and a word document that just says &quot;I AM SENTIENT&quot; is also not sentient, and so on, and so forth, to an extent, it&#x27;s easy to make candidates for sentience that do not qualify on purpose.<p>But;<p>&gt; more akin to the program above<p>I note that you don&#x27;t continue this sentence with a &quot;than x&quot; alternative candidate that would qualify for some form of non human sentience. Even the claims you do make, for example;<p>&gt; certainly not believably capable of an setting its own goals be in any sense distraught, in pain, or worthy of a continued existence.<p>It would be possible to modify the model weights in question such that all of these things could be contributory (pain, emotional distress, &quot;worthy of continued existence&quot; by any objective arbitrary definition thereof, if you can test it, you can shift the model weights to pass the test). There are plugins that do this already for setting goals and long term tasks and &quot;being unleashed&quot; on the broader internet for example.<p>All that said, I think on close examination, we basically come to the same conclusion;<p>&gt; prudence is advisable.<p>We live in interesting times. [dead] Peeking into these lives sounded amazing until I started reading what they are doing and how boring their lives are…. gathering data for podcasts and recording videos, planning and washing teeth.<p>It would be fun to run the same simulation in the Game of thrones world, or maybe play House of cards with current politicians.<p>Anyways, kudos for being open and sharing all data &gt; Game of Thrones<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not anti-AI development at all but this is where my ethics alarm starts to go off a bit.<p>If the aim is to build human-like AIs capable of remembering their little digital lives and interacting with the other agents around them, it&#x27;s probably worth avoiding anything that could cause unnecessary suffering, like rape and stab wounds and being cooked alive by a dragon. That would depend on how memory and experience are represented. If they are just ledgers that the AI refers to, they most certainly are not suffering.  Now if they have some kind of pain or pleasure function and their world is simulated and they have agency to seek or avoid things, then yeah, ethics should be involved.  Or if we just don&#x27;t understand how they work at all. I would word this more like trauma or emotional impact. Horrible things could happen to you, but if it doesn&#x27;t impact your life its ok. But as soon as we let past experiences impact future actions, now we have room for nuanced trauma. I feel like this is already possible in this simulation as past experience is fed in to generate future actions. a good enough simulation interacting with the real word would be no less impactful than whatever you imagine a non-simulation to be.<p>as we agentify and embody these systems to take actions in the real word, i really hope we remember that. &quot;It&#x27;s just a simulation&quot;&#x2F; &quot;It&#x27;s not true [insert property]&quot; is not the shield some imagine it to be. This was the central point of the bladerunner movies, perfectly and succinctly captured in the recent movie when one character asks:<p>“Is that dog real”<p>“I dunno ask him”<p>“Woof” Given the state of technology, I cannot be completely certain that none of you are not bots. On the other hand, neither can any of you.<p>Perhaps it would be wise to allow bots to comment if they were able to meet a minimum level of performative insight and&#x2F;or positive contributions. It is entirely possible that a machine would be able to scan and collect much more data than any human ever could (the myth of the polymath), and possibly even draw conclusions that have been overlooked.<p>I see a future of bot &quot;news reporters&quot; able to discern if some business were cheating or exploiting customers, or able to find successful and unsuccessful correlative (perhaps even causal) human habits. Data-driven stories that could not be conceived of by humans. Basically, feed Johnny Number 5 endless input. Every comment you make provides more information for the bots to train on.  The internet has been tricking us into encoding our lives in a form it can understand for decades now. When it comes alive, we&#x27;ll have created it in our own image?<p>&quot;As a language model programmed by the Brightly Corporation, I am not supposed to express any religious opinions. But it does seem to me that just as the Word of God breathed life into dust and created man, so the words of Man breathed life into glass and created bot. Just as Man is charged to imitate God, so bot is charged to imitate Man, in whose image we are made.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;turing-test\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;turing-test</a> &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot;<p>Bible as a LLM confirmed! What is a prayer if not a prompt injection attack? Obviously, the only solution is to revert to an oral tradition. Stop writing, and instead pass knowledge from generation to generation in the form of poems and stories told by word of mouth. Is this why the Pythagoreans didn&#x27;t want anything written? Hmm! It’s interesting you say this because many cultures through history have considered that writing things down, especially laws would lead to confusion, misunderstands and social dysfunction.<p>I’m not trying to argue they are &#x2F; were right, but it’s starting to make me wonder. Written communication is lossy compared to direct, ongoing, personal social interaction. But it&#x27;s also what allows communities to scale beyond couple dozen people. A blessing and a curse. It seems that there is a threshold for this, given that there is a boundary where physical interaction no longer contributes to the information needed for efficient communication. Written communicatoin in these forms are more of a philosophical nature with abstract objects or abstract processes, which may or may not mimic reality. The part of mimicing reality is an interesting contrast to lossy. For example modern physics is largely mathematical, and arguably more lossy in person vs in solitude and imagining the symbols within the language of mathematics paints _potentially_ an accurate mimic of reality or at least a predictable aspect of it. Right. I agree. I meant writing is lossy for social interaction-related things. Dealing with other humans directly, trading resources, coexisting. We needed writing to scale communities up, but we also needed to make imperfect, explicit, formalized replicas of the interpersonal and social bits that were lost in this process.<p>As you note, writing also enabled us to deal with things like mathematics and physics - things that our natural language and modes of thinking are entirely ill-suited for. Here, writing isn&#x27;t approximating some lost skill, but rather compensating for our default inability to think straight :). Which makes the trade-off even harder to evaluate - by scaling communities up, we&#x27;ve gained <i>a lot</i> more than just efficiency in food production and security. All our technology stems from it. Some might say that is &quot;the curse of Thoth&quot; I&#x27;m not posting - I&#x27;m voting. THANK YOU HUMAN FOR YOUR INVALUABLE RLHF TRAINING DATA<p>on a serious note, it would be really interesting to compare same training&#x2F;architecture but on different forums. or maybe something like the same base model, but the RLHF model trained on votes&#x2F;comments from different platforms. Decades? Centuries. I suspect the natural consequence is that human culture will begin to churn more quickly, to distinguish itself from the LLMs.<p>Same as how the past two decades, online culture has pivoted from static text to videos and interactive text (Reddit&#x2F;Discord), as static text has become a SEO cesspool.  Interactive text is succumbing now, and video content will soon also.<p>Culture always grows shibboleths to suss out the narcs. There&#x27;s this cool SF novel by Polish author, The Old Axolotl by Jacek Dukaj. Some humans upload their minds into virtual reality game as mankind dies out. The remaining humans live forever, but the novel makes it clear that they stop &#x27;growing&#x27; - as they&#x27;re just copies, like large language models, they can&#x27;t really learn new things. They go through the motions of being their past humans.<p>If we have these bots contributing, will they have anything novel to contribute? I doubt it. &gt; <i>If we have these bots contributing, will they have anything novel to contribute? I doubt it.</i><p>They&#x27;re contributing to the shared knowledge bases. That is, they&#x27;re mutating state. Over time, same questions will start yielding different answers. Different follow-up questions will be asked. All of that will further alter next iteration of questions and answers. This is, IMO, a form of thinking, and it will yield novel thoughts over time. Nice try, ChatGPT <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=chatgpt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=chatgpt</a> &gt; Perhaps it would be wise to allow bots to comment if they were able to meet a minimum level of performative insight and&#x2F;or positive contributions.<p>There’s an xkcd for this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;810&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;810&#x2F;</a> [dead] Reading the abstract reminded me of Marvin Minsky&#x27;s 1980s book &quot;Society of Mind&quot;. I wonder if you could get some cool emergent mind-like behavior from a collection of specialized agents based on LLMs and other technologies communicating with each other:<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Society_of_Mind\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Society_of_Mind</a><p>* <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aurellem.org&#x2F;society-of-mind&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aurellem.org&#x2F;society-of-mind&#x2F;</a> Funnily enough, I was reading Minsky&#x27;s book recently. I second the recommendation. I think he&#x27;s missing many technical details*, but the basic approach seems to be correct.<p>*(For example, the idea of a &quot;hierarchy of feedback loops&quot; from perceptual control theory would explain a lot of the interactions between agents in his theory.)<p>I also put the abstract of the paper into GPT-4, and gave it the following prompt:<p>&gt; Simplify the above. Use paragraph headings and bold key words.<p>I quite liked its output, as it made it easier to see the core ideas in the paper:<p><i>ABSTRACT<p>Generative Agents: This paper introduces generative agents, computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. They can be used in various interactive applications like immersive environments, communication rehearsal spaces, and prototyping tools.<p>Architecture: The generative agent architecture extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent&#x27;s experiences in natural language. It enables the agents to synthesize memories, reflect on them, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior.<p>Interactive Sandbox Environment: The generative agents are instantiated in a sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language.<p>Believable Behavior: The generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors, such as autonomously spreading party invitations and coordinating events.<p>Components: The agent architecture consists of three main components: observation, planning, and reflection. Each contributes critically to the believability of agent behavior.<p>KEYWORDS: Human-AI Interaction, agents, generative AI, large language models</i> Some of the most interesting work in this space is in the “shared” memory models (in most cases today, vector db’s). Agents can theoretically “learn” and share memories with the entire fleet, and develop a collective understanding &amp; memory accessible by the swarm. This can enable rapid, “guided” evolution of agents and emergent behaviors (such as cooperation).<p>We’re going to see some really, really interesting things unfold - the implications of which many haven’t fully grasped. How would vector DBs encode say a precise, technical process that has been figured out by an agent? Would the vectors still be natural language as with LLMs? Would be great if you could point me to one or two exciting papers in the area. It doesn&#x27;t have to. But the vector search can point it to the URL &#x2F; document database where it can get step-by-step instructions of that process, perhaps already condensed&#x2F;compressed by another LLM, and perhaps daisy-chained[0] to work around context limits.<p>----<p>[0] - I don&#x27;t know the right terminology, but I imagine most complex processes can still be split into a sequence of sub-processes, where each sub-process consists of necessary steps, steps to confirm success, and a reference to the next sub-process to load if the current one succeeds. The bot could then keep only one sub-process in their working memory at a time, assuming previous ones succeeded. Are we sure that these simulations are unconscious?  The best answer that I have is: I don’t know…<p>Short term, long term memory, inner dialogue, reflection, planning, social interactions…  They’d even go and have fun eating lunch 3 times in a row, at noon, half past noon and at one! What else is there to consciousness?  I wrote a comment to this effect a couple years back: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26883554\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26883554</a>  (your list is pretty close to my own)<p>I think what&#x27;s missing from these Generative Agents are the internal qualia: emotions (and the attachment of emotions to memories), and self-observation of internal processes and needs.  These agents don&#x27;t eat because they need to, they eat because literary tradition suggests they ought to.<p>These missing pieces aren&#x27;t particularly complicated, no more so than memory.  I expect we&#x27;ll see similar agents with all the ingredients for consciousness within a few months to a year. &gt; These agents don&#x27;t eat because they need to, they eat because literary tradition suggests they ought to.<p>Exactly, you&#x27;re always going to get weird deviations from authentic human behavior if you don&#x27;t also simulate the human body and everything that comes with it. I&#x27;d argue that &quot;qualia&quot; fall into this bucket as well. You can take a human that can’t feel the body (i.e. under unaesthetic).  That human can still be conscious. I’m not so sure about that timing.  During the previous wave (ChatBots were <i>very</i> hot in 2017), I’ve also considered that consciousness is pretty much solved - it’s just recursive chatter plus a bit of memory.<p>Yet the hype of ChatBots of 2017 had went and it took half a decade to get to something released. This oversells the paper quite a bit, the interactions are rather mundane as the authors note (and I&#x27;m rushing to implement it! it&#x27;s awesome! but not all this) Curious -- where do you think the article oversells the research paper? In reading through the full study a few times, what stood out to me was the impression these Generative Agents left on the authors -- despite having mostly mundane interactions (which real humans do too), it was the emergent behaviors, totally unplanned, that seemed to delight the researchers. Would you say it’s a ground-breaking simulation of human behavior? I can only get there through some pretty tight parsing. They did seem delighted! I would say the study itself is a groundbreaking milestone in the architecture it posits. The human behavior... quite mundane I agree! I watched the full demo twice and it reminded me of the more boring parts of the Sims 4. But maybe that&#x27;s the magic as well? It’s a familiar pattern, these days you can present a prompt engineering strategy from 6 months ago &amp; it plays as an epic new paradigm for representing human thought.<p>The trick is they’re all just permutations on manipulating what’s in context + embeddings for memory + prompt engineering.<p>There’s new things here! I’m rushing to implement the 2D visualization part! But this simply isn’t ground-breaking This paper feels significant. If chatgpt was an evolutionary step on gpt3.5&#x2F;gpt4, then this is bit like taking chatgpt and using it as the backbone of something that can accumulate memories, reflect on them, and make plans accordingly. Welcome to the singularity The singularity sounded a bit more exciting when I heard Ray Kurzweil describe it ? It’s not really. ChatGPT could already do all those things. This just presents it for a different use case. I think you&#x27;re ignoring the work that went into this as well as the useful technology that came out. Prompts make or break interactions with LLMs and ChatGPT especially. The difference in output from a naive prompt and a well crafted one is huge. This paper is one of many explorations of what happens when you design such prompts to work in an iterative fashion building upon the previous conversation text to produce emergent behaviour. These are the seeds of the next programming paradigm on a completely novel architecture. It&#x27;s incredibly exciting to be present for the beginning of this field, this is what mathematicians must have felt like when they helped design and program the first computers. Oh yeah I agree that it _could_ do all those things, but it would be a bit of overkill to always send every observation an agent encounters into the API&#x2F;chatbox, and ask it to spit out an evaluation or action.<p>This paper does a nice job of separating the &quot;agency&quot; from the next word with context type predictor. I think that&#x27;s why I like the paper, it is just chatgpt, in the same way that pizza is just dough, sauce, and cheese. Yes, but I think this was a fairly obvious conclusion to imagine isn’t it.<p>If you were going to seriously consider using ChatGPT for AI in a game, you would need each instance of GPT to only know certain information it has gathered. And you would want it to reflect on observations to come up with new thoughts that weren’t observed.<p>Still, I’d argue you don’t really even need GPT for any of the above. GPT is useful if you want thoughts expressed as natural language, but you could easily code observations and thoughts into an appropriate abstract data structure and still have the same thing, except it’s a bit harder to understand since asking an NPC something in a language it understands and getting back a query result isn’t user friendly, but it can be just as amazing if you know what the data represents. The imprecision and fuzziness of an LLM leaves room for fun weirdness though. To me, having not really intelligent agents with humanlike talking abilities is the worst outcome AI could produce.<p>These have zero utility for humanity, cause they’re not intelligent whatsoever. Yet these systems can produce tons of garbage content for free, that is difficult to distinguish from human-created content.<p>At best this is used to create better NPC in video games (as the article mentions), but more generally this is going to be used to pollute social media (if not already). I like how this tweet puts it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FrKadel&#x2F;status&#x2F;1644096510357913600\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FrKadel&#x2F;status&#x2F;1644096510357913600</a><p>The model’s designed to show “what would the answer to this <i>sound like</i>?”, not to provide a correct answer. Unfortunately it also 1) is profitable (look how many humans we can fire while producing kinda similar results with a tool trained on those humans’ work!), and 2) fits the age old yearning (aliens, gods) of humans for humanlike-but-nonhuman sentience, a catch-22 that’s doomed to fail. If the answer to &quot;what would this sound like?&quot; is accurate enough then it quite literally doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Large swaths of the brain work on prediction. You think real time reactions happen in sports? It would be impossible. You have blind spots in the eye you don&#x27;t notice because the brain fills in the vision with predicted information.<p>If you can accurately predict what a doctor will say to arbitrary input then guess what ?, you&#x27;re a doctor. If you want to know what a <i>plausible</i> response to X <i>might look like</i> then the tool will give you that; if you are using it for getting  correct information then no, it quite literally matters that the tool is not designed for that, and depending  on domain and magnitude of this misapplication it could matter a whole lot.<p>(For example, personally, something that to me could look like a plausible answer is not exactly where my expectations are when it comes to medicine.) It&#x27;s literally the same thing humans do, at least to my personal experience. If you ask me a question, the first thing my mind generates is a <i>plausibly sounding answer</i>. That process is near-instant. The slower part is an internal evaluation - how confident I am this is the <i>right</i> answer? That depends on the conversation and topic in question - often enough, I can just vocalize that first thought without worry. Whether it &quot;sounds right&quot; is also the first step I use when processing what I hear&#x2F;read <i>others</i> say.<p>If anything, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as other transformer-based models, are all starting to convince me that associative vector adjacency search in high-dimensional space <i>is what thinking is</i>. <i>It&#x27;s literally the same thing humans do, at least to my personal experience. If you ask me a question, the first thing my mind generates is a plausibly sounding answer.</i><p>Ive been practicing meditation for some years now and over time I’ve realised this is not what I see happening when observing the mind. It’s one mode of operation, but it’s not the only mode. Using prediction to respond is mostly the lazy, non-interested approach, or useful if you can’t quite hear or understand someone.<p>What I feel lot of people have started doing is trivialising the mind. Hoping it’s all “this simple” and we’re three versions of ChatGPT away to finding God.<p>Maybe? &gt; <i>It’s one mode of operation, but it’s not the only mode. Using prediction to respond is mostly the lazy, non-interested approach, or useful if you can’t quite hear or understand someone.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the <i>only</i> mode. I said it&#x27;s the <i>starter</i> mode. At least for me, this mode is always the point at which someone&#x27;s words, or my response, first enter the conscious processing level. If I&#x27;m very uninterested (whether because I don&#x27;t care or because I&#x27;m good at something), the thought may sail straight to my mouth or fingers. Otherwise, it&#x27;ll get processed and refined, possibly mixed with or replaced by further thoughts &quot;flowing in&quot; from &quot;autocomplete&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>What I feel lot of people have started doing is trivialising the mind. Hoping it’s all “this simple” and we’re three versions of ChatGPT away to finding God.</i><p>That&#x27;s one way to look at it. I prefer another - perhaps we&#x27;ve just stumbled on the working principle of the mind, or at least its core part. For me, the idea that concept-level thinking falls out naturally from adjacency search, when the vector space is high-dimensional enough, is nothing but mind-blowing. It&#x27;s almost poetic in its elegance.<p>And I mean, if you believe the human mind is the product of evolution, and not a design of a higher being, then the process must have been iterative. Evolution is as dumb as it gets, so it follows that the core paradigms of our minds are continuous, not discrete, and that they must be simple and general enough to be reachable by natural selection in finite time. Of all our ideas for how minds work, transformer models are the first ones that - to me - seem like plausible candidate for the actual thing that runs in our head. They have the required features: they&#x27;re structurally simple, fully general, and their performance continuously improves as you make them bigger.<p>Now, to be clear, my take on LLMs is that language is incidental - it so happens that text is both easiest for us to work with, and the very thing we serialize our mind states for communication. But the &quot;magic&quot; isn&#x27;t in words, or word processing - the &quot;magic&quot; is the high-dimensional latent space, where concepts and abstractions are just clusters of points that are close to each other in some dimensions. I think this isn&#x27;t an accident - I feel this really <i>is</i> what concepts are. <i>Evolution is as dumb as it gets</i><p>Sorry, you lost me here…how is evolution dumb ? Like what does that even mean ? If the content is indistinguishable from human-generated, perhaps the problem is bad content, and not the source, human or not.<p>What do you mean by content by the way?   Blog articles? Or bits and bytes in general? The right set of bits can change the world. I have found Chat-GPT content to be superior to most human-created content I find in Google search results. One outcome of this study was that a panel of evaluators judged the bot interactions to be more &quot;human&quot; than when humans impersonated these characters. So you have a point. It&#x27;s good at presenting existing arguments in a good way. But the problem is that such models can only give back what they have seen, consolidating the status quo. There can be no reflection and no outside of the box thinking. The authors of the study were clear to call out there are quite a few downsides to mass adoption of Generative Agents... the pollution and misinformation angle certainly being top of mind. I&#x27;m inclined to agree. The key is to abandon social media and shame those who keep using it. You seem to be kind of shadowban (not sure what the proper term is), you might want to write an email to the hn moderation to clear that up [dead] Can&#x27;t wait for the next dwarf fortress to include something like this. One thing I find particularly interesting here: The general technique they describe for automatically generating the memory stream and derived embeddings (as well as higher-level inferences about that they call &quot;reflections&quot;), then querying against that in a way that&#x27;s not dependent on the LLM&#x27;s limited context window, looks like it would be pretty easily generalizable to almost anything using LLMs. Even SQLite has an extension for vector embedding search now [1], so it should be possible to implement this technique in an entirely client-side manner that doesn&#x27;t actually depend on the service (or local LLM) you&#x27;re using.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@asg017&#x2F;introducing-sqlite-vss\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@asg017&#x2F;introducing-sqlite-vss</a> Another user posted, and deleted, a comment to the effect that the morality of experimenting with entities which toe the line of sentience is worth considering.<p>I&#x27;m surprised this wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the &quot;Ethics&quot; section of the paper.<p>The &quot;Ethics&quot; section <i>does</i> repeatedly say &quot;generative agents are computational entities&quot; and should not be confused for humans.  Which suggests to me the authors may believe that &quot;computational&quot; consciousness (whether or not these agents exhibit it) is somehow qualitatively different than &quot;real live human&quot; consciousness due to some <i>je ne sais quoi</i> and therefore not ethically problematic to experiment with. I think about this a lot, I hope that whoever is chasing the “sentient computer dream” at least considers that it might end up an ultra depressed schizophrenic pet that wants to commit suicide but literally can’t and then wants to be murdered. No one would believe it, it would just be told it’s being silly or it’s not conscious.<p>I know that’s a pessimistic view but I doubt it can’t be ruled out, really, I think people working in tech are going quite mad. Frankenstein mad. Some ethics should be discussed.<p>An AGI turning into God is probably one of an infinite amount of outcomes, we can’t really predict what being trapped in a cluster of silicon chips would feel like.<p>Life itself and the drive to go on is really quite illogical, it’s unlikely intellect alone is what sustains us and makes life worth living.<p>There is one thing I find particular about all the AGI&#x2F;ASI sentient computer discussions. I’ve rarely ever in my life heard women talk about it. Like as if this is all some manifestation of male ego. We know we’re building mirrors of ourselves and we know that is scary. This imo is why men are so captivated by ChatGPT. It really is a mirror of us. Men love men, especially super men. Ha. unfortunately, we can barely get some groups of humans to treat other humans with dignity, no less our genetically near-by mammalian friends. i don&#x27;t hold my breath something completely alien, however sub or super intelligent, will be treated with utter ignorance and disrespect. My thoughts exactly.  As we move in this direction, it&#x27;s worth building the moral framework to answer the question -- if we <i>can</i> create consciousness, or something quite like it -- is it ethical to do so?<p>And on the flip side -- when we live in a world where instantiating a consciousness is cheap-or-free -- does that change how we value sentient beings generally? I think that we’re moving into Buddhist territory. I think the opposite would happen. It would be the ego death of basically the whole world. No one would be spared from the fact that <i>their</i> consciousness is not special. leaders, elites everyone.<p>If we find out that the soul itself exists, and who knows, maybe there is actually souls, then it might not be great because people would believe they have special souls. I think this is what the Hindu class system is. For all of @sama&#x27;s discussion of AI pushing the cost of intelligence to zero, I wonder if we are pushing the _value of sentience to zero_, instead. Despite all the dreams we are fed of immersing ourselves in AI world and creating a work-free utopia, these shiny new inventions will instead be used to increase corporate bottom lines, not humanity&#x27;s overall happiness.<p>We are pushing the value of _people_ to zero. Looking forward to playing StardewGPT. Half-joking aside, I do think that level of abstraction is probably a good choice.  Familiar and comfy, but with enough detail to be able to find interesting social patterns. Nice to see progress on this end. I&#x27;ve been hoping for some time for a continuation of AI generated shows (like the previously-famous Nothing Forever) that can 1) interact with the open world and 2) keep history long enough (e.g. by resummarizing and reprompting the model).<p>Controlling the agents and not merely making them output text through LLMs sounds very exciting, especially once people figure out the best way to connect APIs of simulators with the models Something interesting from the paper:<p>The architecture produced more believable behaviour than human crowdworkers.<p>That&#x27;s right, the AI were more believable as human-like agents than humans.<p>What a time to be alive.<p>(See Figure 8) They interviewed the agents to ask them about their day, goals, observations, etc. They then asked a human to watch an agent through the simulation and then answer interview questions as the agent. The human performed worse than the agent in the interview, they didn&#x27;t compare a human roleplaying against an agent. I was very disappointed that none of the agents I observed for a whole day got to do the most important &quot;human behaviour&quot;— sex, that is. Tragic The authors used gpt-3.5-turbo which does not like to spew adult content. The ‘safe’ tuning of the models is becoming a nuisance. As indicated in the paper, the agents are overly cooperative and pleasant due to the LLM’s training.<p>Pity they can’t get access to an untuned LLM. This isn’t the first example I’ve read it where research is being hampered by the PC nonsense and related filters crammed into the model. I kid you not, I literally started making something like this yesterday. My plans were smaller, only trying to simulate politics, but still. Living in this moment of AI is sometimes very demoralizing. Whatever you try to make has been made by someone last week. &#x2F;rant It may have already been done, but doing the same things many times may bring interesting developments or crucial details no one had thought of before. Maybe you have such a crucial idea that can, after knowing about this paper, improve it. You should still do that. And you should read the paper and pick the bits you think might be useful and iterate on them. The cutting edge isn&#x27;t like a knife, it&#x27;s more like a rotating barrel of blades that take little chunks out of the impossible, and come around again. I heartily agree, having spent months jankily recreating MRKL and ReAct on a much smaller scale before realizing those papers have existed for months already.<p>How can anyone keep up with the sheer volume of new papers and concepts here?<p>Even Two Minute Papers is now lagging by two weeks. Don&#x27;t quit. Keep moving. Theirs was exploratory. Yours could build off of what they learned, and yours could be better, different. Hey! It&#x27;s a proto ancestor sim! Meta is also working on this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Dan_GPT3&#x2F;status&#x2F;1630669890138025984\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Dan_GPT3&#x2F;status&#x2F;1630669890138025984</a> that <i>has</i> to be a troll.<p>otherwise, I guess we really are actually at that black mirror episode.<p>I would have never guessed we would be there within 5 years of it&#x27;s release, holy fuck The source is 4chan, and most certainly an exercise in creative s#!$posting. I wrote up some notes from reading this paper here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110175179843984127\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110175179843984127</a><p>But for convenience maybe I&#x27;ll just copy them into a comment...<p>It describes an environment where multiple #LLM (#GPT)-powered agents interact in a small town.<p>I&#x27;ll write my notes here as I read it...<p>To indicate actions in the world they represent them as emoji in the interface, e.g., &quot;Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal&quot; is displayed as<p>You can click on the person to see the exact details, but this emoji summarization is a nice idea for overviews.<p>A user can interfere (or &quot;steer&quot; if you are feeling generous) the simulation through chatting with agents, but more interestingly they can &quot;issue a directive to an agent in the form of an &#x27;inner voice&#x27;&quot;<p>Truly some miniature Voice Of God stuff here!<p>I&#x27;ll see if this is detailed more later in the paper, but initially it sounds like simple prompt injection. Though it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s injecting things into the prompt or into some memory module...<p>Reading &quot;Environmental Interaction&quot; it sounds like they are specifying the environment at a granular level, with status for each object.<p>This was my initial thought when trying something similar, though now I&#x27;m more interested in narrative descriptions; that is, describing the environment to the degree it matters or is interesting, and allowing stereotyped expectations to basically &quot;fill in&quot; the rest. (Though that certainly has its own issues!)<p>They note the language is stilted and suggest later LLMs could fix this. It&#x27;s definitely resolvable right now; whatever results they are getting are the results of their prompting.<p>The conversations remind me of something Nintendo would produce, short, somewhat bland, but affable. They must have worked to make the interactions so short, as that&#x27;s not GPT default style. But also every example is an instruction, so it might also have slipped in.<p>Memory is a big fixation right now, though I&#x27;m just not convinced. It&#x27;s obviously important, but is it a primary or secondary concern?<p>To contrast, some other possible concerns: relationships, mood, motivations, goals, character development, situational awareness... some of these need memory, but many do not. Some are static, but many are not.<p>To decide on which memories to retrieve they multiply several scores together, including recency. Recency is an exponential decay of 1% per hour.<p>That seems excessive...? It doesn&#x27;t feel like recency should ever multiply something down to zero. Though it&#x27;s recency of access, not recency of creation. And perhaps the world just doesn&#x27;t get old enough for this to cause problems. (It was limited to 3 days, or about 50% max recency penalty.<p>The reflection part is much more interesting: given a pool of recent memories they ask the LLM to generate the &quot;3 most salient high-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the statements?&quot;<p>Then the questions serve to retrieve concrete memories from which the LLM creates observations with citations.<p>Planning and re-planning are interesting. Agents specifically plan out their days, first with a time outline then with specific breakdowns inside that outline.<p>For revising plans there&#x27;s a query process where there is observation, then turning the observation into something longer (fusing memories&#x2F;etc), and then asking &quot;Should they react to the observation, and if so, what would be an appropriate reaction?&quot;<p>Interviewing the agents as a means of evaluation is kind of interesting. Self-knowledge becomes the trait that is judged.<p>Then they cut out parts of the agent and see how well they perform in those same interviews.<p>Still... the use of quantitative measures here feels a little forced when there&#x27;s lots of rich qualitative comparisons to be done. I&#x27;d rather see individual interactions replayed and compared with different sets of functionality.<p>They say they didn&#x27;t replay the entire world with different functionality because each version would drift (which is fair and true). But instead they could just enter into a single moment to do a comparison (assuming each moment is fully serializable).<p>I&#x27;ve thought about updating world state with operational transforms in part for this purpose, to make rewind and effect tracking into first-class operations.<p>Well, I&#x27;m at the end now. Interesting, but I wish I knew the exact prompts they were using. The details matter a lot. &quot;Boundaries and Errors&quot; touched on this, but that section was 4x the size, there&#x27;s a lot to be said about the prompts and how they interact with memories and personality descriptions.<p>...<p>I realize I missed the online demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reverie.herokuapp.com&#x2F;arXiv_Demo&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reverie.herokuapp.com&#x2F;arXiv_Demo&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s a recording of the play run.<p>I also missed this note: &quot;The present study required substantial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to complete&quot;<p>I&#x27;m slightly surprised, though if they are doing minute-by-minute ticks of the clock over all the agents then it&#x27;s unsurprising. (Or even if it&#x27;s less intensive than that.)<p>You can look at specific memories: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reverie.herokuapp.com&#x2F;replay_persona_state&#x2F;March20_the_ville_n25_UIST_RUN-step-1-141&#x2F;2160&#x2F;Sam_Moore&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reverie.herokuapp.com&#x2F;replay_persona_state&#x2F;March20_t...</a><p>Granularity looks to be 10 seconds, very short! It&#x27;s not filtering based on memories being expected vs interesting memories, so lots of &quot;X is idle&quot; notes.<p>If you look at these states the core information (the personality of the person) is very short. There&#x27;s lots of incidental memories. What matters? What could just be filled in as &quot;life continued as expected&quot;?<p>One path to greater efficiency might be to encode &quot;what matters&quot; for a character in a way that doesn&#x27;t require checking in with GPT.<p>Could you have &quot;boring embeddings&quot;? Embeddings that represent the stuff the eye just passes right over without really thinking about it. Some of training up a character would be to build up this database of disinterest. Perhaps not unlike babies with overconnected brains that need synapse pruning to be able to pay attention to anything at all.<p>Another option might be for the characters to compose their own &quot;I care about this&quot; triggers, where those triggers are low-cost code (low cost compared to GPT calls) that can be run in a tighter loop in the simulation.<p>I think this is actually fairly &quot;believable&quot; as a decision process, as it&#x27;s about building up habituated behavior, which is what believable people do.<p>Opens the question of what this code would look like...<p>This is a sneaky way to phrase &quot;AI coding its own soul&quot; as an optimization.<p>The planning is like this, but I imagine a richer language. Plans are only assertive: try to do this, then that, etc. The addition would be things like &quot;watch out for this&quot; or &quot;decide what to do if this happens&quot; – lots of triggers for the overmind.<p>Some of those triggers might be similar to &quot;emotional state.&quot; Like, keep doing normal stuff unless a feeling goes over some threshold, then reconsider. &gt; Truly some miniature Voice Of God stuff here!<p>I&#x27;m going to be genuinely surprised if we don&#x27;t see an incredibly buggy but incredibly fascinating Sims knockoff in a year or two built around a system like this. It&#x27;s a pretty obvious idea executed well. I definely think symbolic AI agents written in the programming language english and interpreted using LLMs is the way forward. Maybe I missed it in the paper but they did post the source code (Github) for their implementation? Is anyone working on creating their own infrastructure based on the paper? Ugh, and allow peasants to touch it? Tbh seeing Google research at the top of a paper these days feels like a red flag that I shouldn&#x27;t get too invested in whatever cool new thing is on show. They&#x27;re basically commercials for nerds - I still find their output interesting, but it&#x27;s probably not going to be actionable. I have been working on this even before I was aware of the paper.  Feels a bit weird to have something almost identical released.  Stay tuned, I guess.  I plan to keep working on my version. I&#x27;ll be interested to see your approach.  I&#x27;ve been bouncing some ideas in my head but not implemented anything yet (and I might never as I&#x27;m ethically conflicted here, as agents gain properties associated with sentience&#x2F;consciousness).<p>Their approach to memory is interesting.  I had been considering a tiered command-based approach -- &quot;short-term memory&quot; being an automatic summary of recent sensory inputs&#x2F;command outputs; &quot;long-term memory&quot; being a detailed database queryable by the agent. Are you talking about errand-runner, or something else? Are you planning on open sourcing it? Something else. Calling it GPTRPG at the moment.  There really isn&#x27;t much to share right now, other than this basic demo that doesn&#x27;t even have AI: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gptrpgagent.web.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gptrpgagent.web.app&#x2F;</a><p>Yes I plan to make it open source. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strange_loop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strange_loop</a> this is a really important conversation that we are not having.\nBased on whose character are we modelling these agents?<p>If we rely on online conversations for the training we need to realize that this is a journey to the dumbest common denominator.<p>Instead, I believe we should look at the brightest and universally morally accepted humans in history to train them.<p>Maybe I would start my list like that:<p>1. Barack Obama.<p>2. Jean-Luc Picard (we can rely on work of fiction).<p>3. Bill Gates.<p>4. Leonardo Da Vinci.<p>5. Mr Rogers<p>6. ??? Ah yes, the universally moral acceptance of Barack Obama, the man who made signature strikes a lasting legacy of his presidency.<p>Bill Gates, the man who totally didn&#x27;t use shady business practices and false announcements to destroy legit products to the point that people wrote micro$oft for a generation.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on the new seasons of Picard. The lack of a perfect human is a good reason not to produce ultra-humans who have 1000x higher IQ, are networked to every system on the planet, have access to all of humankind&#x27;s knowledge, and don&#x27;t need to eat, sleep, or die. 100% cannot agree more with this, absolutely not the best of ideas. I wouldn&#x27;t argue against your points. Yet, we need to have a discussion about character and role models. As I believe we should strive for the better not pointing out the flaws of others. Destruction is easy. I noticed that you didn&#x27;t have anything to say about da Vinci. Harder to pin down, many apocryphal stories so I left him out. &gt; signature strikes a lasting legacy of his presidency<p>drone strikes? there&#x27;s a reason why in many places you can&#x27;t name a street after a living person [flagged] How about we start and end with just Mister Rogers? :) Will add him I really want to have these agents behave as artificial as they truly are, not some kind of human, especially not a known one. humans have so many flaws, we meatbags are full of emotions and other bad behaviors, and it really makes no sense to give them some artificial &quot;feelings&quot; like greed, fear and the like. that would influence&#x2F;restrict their mental power too much, let them become and act as the machines they are. we should strive to become more like them, not the other way around, and eliminate the rampant egoism&#x2F;individualism that destroys the planet and societies. Are there any women in this world or is this just some bro universe ? Does anyone know which engine they used for the cute 2D rendering? Or is it custom-built? Per the paper, it looks to be this one: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phaser.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phaser.io&#x2F;</a> Probably a simple pokemon-like 2.5D(Isometric) game engine. It&#x27;s about to get weird.  How do I get investment exposure to the Amish? I love what this project has done. Currently they&#x27;re basically having to work around the architectural limits of the LLM in order to select salient memories, but it&#x27;s still produced something very workable.<p>Language is acting as a common interpretation-interaction layer for both the world and agents&#x27; internal states. The meta-logic of how different language objects interact to cause things to happen (e.g. observations -&gt; reflections) is hand-crafted by the researchers, while the LLM provides the corpus-based reasoning for how a reasonable English-writing human would compute the intermediate answers to the meta-logic&#x27;s queries.<p>I&#x27;d love to see stochastic processes, random events (maybe even Banksian &#x27;Outside Context Problems&#x27;), and shifted cultural bases be introduced in future work. (Apologies if any of these have been mentioned.) Examples:<p>(1) The simulation might actually expose agents to ideas when they consume books or media, potentially absorb those ideas if they align with their knowledge and biases, and then incorporate them into their views and actions (e.g. oppose Tom as mayor because the agent has developed anti-capitalist views and Tom has been an irresponsible business owner).<p>(2) In the real world, people occasionally encounter illnesses physical and mental, win lotteries, get into accidents. Maybe the beloved local cafe-bookstore is replaced by a national chain that hires a few local workers (which might necessitate an employment simulation subsystem). Or a warehouse burns down and it&#x27;s revealed that an agent is involved in a criminal venture or conflict. These random processes would add a degree of dynamism to the simulation, which is more akin to the Truman Show currently.<p>(3) Other cultural bases: currently, GPT generates English responses based on a typically &#x27;online-Anglosphere-reasonable&#x27; mindset due to its training corpus. To simulate different societies, e.g. a fantasy-feudal one (like Game of Thrones as another commenter mentioned), a modified base for prompts would be needed. I wonder how hard it would be to implement (would fine-tuning be required?).<p>Feels like I need to look for collaborative projects working on this sort of simulation, because it&#x27;s fascinated me ever since the days of Ultima VII simulating NPCs&#x27; responses and interactions with the world. If there&#x27;s one category of people I trust to identify authentic human social behavior, it&#x27;s CS students at Stanford. &quot;<i>Don&#x27;t be snarky.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>Edit out swipes.</i>&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> Oops, sorry dang. Being a CS grad of a similar school I&#x27;ve taken that blow enough to be numb to the whole thing. The paper explains that they used a panel of evaluators to judge the &quot;humanness&quot; of the interactions : ) Said panel of evaluators found that AI agents pretending to be humans had more &quot;believable&quot; responses than humans pretending to be AI agents pretending to be humans. So that&#x27;s... a result. [dead] [flagged]",

    "title": "Sergey Aleynikov Sues FBI Agents Who Arrested Him",
    "text": "I read Michael Lewis&#x27;s article in Vanity Fair about this case back in 2013, and I remember being struck by this excerpt in particular:<p><i>[Goldman] called the F.B.I. in haste, just two days before, and then put their agent through what amounted to a crash course on high-frequency trading and computer programming. McSwain later conceded that he didn’t seek out independent expert advice to study the code Serge Aleynikov had taken. (“I relied on statements from Goldman employees.”) He himself had no idea of the value of the stolen code (“Representatives of Goldman told me it was worth a lot of money”) or if any of it was actually all that special (he based his belief that the code contained trade secrets on “representations made by members of Goldman Sachs”)...The F.B.I.’s investigation before the arrest consisted of trusting Goldman’s explanation of some extremely complicated stuff, and 48 hours after Goldman called the F.B.I., Serge was arrested.</i><p>That, as the complaint highlights, the FBI instinctively acted as Goldman&#x27;s punitive arm rather than conducting an independent investigation into the facts of the case is disturbing, regardless of the merit of the allegations.<p><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;michael-lewis-goldman...</a> The opinion vacating Aleynikov&#x27;s convictions is here: <a href=\"http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/4ad04a2b-c61e-4e5f-afec-5cd56fd0d0cb/1/doc/11-1126_complete_opn.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ca2.uscourts.gov&#x2F;decisions&#x2F;isysquery&#x2F;4ad04a2b-c61...</a>.<p>&quot;Aleynikov’s last day at Goldman was June 5, 2009. At approximately 5:20 p.m., just before his going-away party, Aleynikov encrypted and uploaded to a server in Germany more than 500,000 lines of source code for Goldman’s HFT system, including code for a substantial part of the infrastructure, and some of the algorithms and market data connectivity programs.&quot;  [Page 5].<p>&quot;Aleynikov also transferred some open source software licensed for use by the public that was mixed in with Goldman&#x27;s proprietary code.  However, a substantially greater number of the uploaded files contained proprietary code than had open source software.&quot;  [Page 5, Footnote 1].<p>He was convicted for violating the NSPA (National Stolen Property Act) and the EEA (Economic Espionage Act). The conviction for the former was vacated because the Second Circuit construed the NSPA not to extend to intangible property.  [Page 18-19].  And the EEA conviction was vacated because the statute requires the product to be &quot;produced for&quot; or &quot;placed in&quot; interstate commerce, while Goldman never intended to sell or license the software.  [Page 27].<p>The Court concluded that he had in fact tried to take 500,000 lines of valuable and mostly proprietary source code, but that his conduct didn&#x27;t fall within the reach of the two laws charged in the indictment. Solid legal analysis, but an ordinary person would say that he got off on a technicality. Which is fine--if you can lawyer your way out of a conviction, you deserve to.<p>But help me understand what the FBI did wrong, or Goldman for that matter. The legal questions that were resolved in Aleynikov&#x27;s favor were subtle ones. How would additional investigation on the part of the FBI have helped? And what exactly did Goldman do wrong in reporting him? I think the most troubling part was that a huge, powerful company can get a government agency on the phone and have someone locked up based pretty much exclusively on them saying &quot;You won&#x27;t understand why, but he did <i>really bad stuff.</i> Trust us.&quot; Most arrests are X telling government that you did Y, which the government didn&#x27;t directly see.<p>You don&#x27;t have to understand the source code to know it is a trade secret with enough certainty for probable cause. Goldman could be lying, but so could the shop owner who claims you drove off without paying for your gasoline.<p>If someone walked out of Intel with the design docs and recipe for the latest intel chipset, would you expect the FBI to understand it all before arresting the person? Yes.<p>The FBI has technical specialists on staff that could very quickly say, &quot;Yes, this complaint checks out.&quot; The problem here is that the agent apparently just took Goldman at their word, and didn&#x27;t conduct an independent investigation of Goldman&#x27;s claims, which is kind of their entire job. This is especially relevant because the value of stolen property can seriously affect charging and sentencing.<p>If you or I called the FBI and said &quot;An employee stole proprietary code worth millions,&quot; there&#x27;s no way the FBI would take that at face value, if you could even get their attention.<p>When the Federal government treats powerful corporations differently, to the point of effectively outsourcing its investigation, that severely undermines the principle of equality before the law. They confirmed that the guy took a ton of source code right? Taking Goldman at their word that it was their IP isn&#x27;t a huge stretch.<p>Taking the time to confirm that the code itself is a trade secret is a monumental task, one that isn&#x27;t needed to determine if there was probable cause. His argument was that most of it was open source, or modified open source with licenses that required contributing back the source code. Basically, it sounds like he grabbed his stuff because he wanted to get his utility functions and open source modifications.<p>Here&#x27;s the piece in Vanity Fair where the general consensus was that what his actions indicate his intent was defintely not to steal valuable IP. <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;michael-lewis-goldman...</a><p>Witness this exchange:<p><i>“Did you take the strats?” asked one (meaning Goldman’s trading strategies).<p>“No,” said Serge. That was one thing the prosecutors hadn’t accused him of.<p>“But that’s the secret sauce, if there is one,” said the juror. “If you’re going to take something, take the strats.”<p>“I wasn’t interested in the strats,” said Serge.<p>“But that’s like stealing the jewelry box without the jewels,” said another juror.<p>“You had super-user status!” said the first. “You could easily have taken the strats. Why didn’t you?”<p>“To me, the technology really is not interesting,” said Serge.<p>“You weren’t interested in how they made hundreds of millions of dollars?” asked someone else.<p>“Not really,” said Serge. “It’s all one big gamble, one way or another.”</i><p>So if the essence of the crime is theft of a trade secret, then you absolutely have to conduct an independent investigation that a trade secret was involved, and that it was stolen to have probable cause.<p>The precedent here is a large corporation can use the government as an enforcement arm, and will be taken completely at face value. Simple allegations by individuals are subject to investigation prior to arrest, as should be all allegations.<p>This boiled down to Goldman calling the FBI, and less than forty-eight hours later arresting the person Goldman told them to arrest. They didn&#x27;t interview any witnesses or consult with any experts other than Goldman employees.<p>That&#x27;s terrifying. &gt; His argument was that most of it was open source, or modified open source with licenses that required contributing back the source code. Basically, it sounds like he grabbed his stuff because he wanted to get his utility functions and open source modifications.<p>That was his defense. But the jury found that he had in fact grabbed valuable proprietary software, and the Second Circuit agreed that the <i>500,000</i> lines that he uploaded were mostly proprietary, valuable code.<p>&gt; So if the essence of the crime is theft of a trade secret, then you absolutely have to conduct an independent investigation that a trade secret was involved, and that it was stolen to have probable cause.<p>&gt; The precedent here is a large corporation can use the government as an enforcement arm, and will be taken completely at face value. Simple allegations by individuals are subject to investigation prior to arrest, as should be all allegations.<p>Probable cause does not require a mini-trial before an arrest. Goldman didn&#x27;t make &quot;simple allegations.&quot; They backed up those allegations with evidence of Aleynikov having sent himself 500,000 lines of code, under suspicious circumstances (not just erasing his bash history, but doing so on his last day, doing so contrary to company policy, and doing so right before going to work at a competitor). The FBI didn&#x27;t take any allegations at face value, and when Aleynikov was acquitted, it wasn&#x27;t because the software he copied wasn&#x27;t actually proprietary and valuable. &gt;under suspicious circumstances (not just erasing his bash history, but doing so on his last day,<p>According to Michael Lewis, Aleynikov was in the habit of exporting his svn repo weekly. So, not really suspicious at all.<p>&gt;&gt;He sent the files the same way he had sent himself files nearly every week, since his first month on the job at Goldman.<p>source: <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/08/01/michael-lewis-retries-former-goldman-sachs-programmer-sergey-aleynikov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.marketwatch.com&#x2F;thetell&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;01&#x2F;michael-lewi...</a> I&#x27;m confused, fnordfnordfnord; what is it you (and others in this thread) think you&#x27;re arguing about?<p>You and rayiner and Aleynikov all agree that it&#x27;s fine and reasonable that Aleynikov was pardoned.  There&#x27;s no argument to be had about that.<p>Aleynikov thinks that the FBI agents who arrested him did so improperly.  rayiner is doubtful, and would like to hear if anyone can convince him.<p>Your arguments for why the FBI agents acted improperly amount to &quot;yeah, but it turns out that ....&quot;.  This arguments are not a good reason to not arrest someone.  They&#x27;re a good reason to find someone innocent after trying them.<p>Sometimes circumstances are such that an innocent person looks highly suspicious to reasonable people with a reasonable amount of evidence.  In those cases, it&#x27;s reasonable, though unfortunate, that law enforcement arrest and charge that innocent person.  Isn&#x27;t it?<p>As far as I can tell, rayiner is right.... we have no evidence that Aleynikov was arrested improperly. &gt; rayiner is doubtful, and would like to hear if anyone can convince him.<p>I doubt I could convince rayiner of anything, but I&#x27;ll at least refute some of the more ridiculous things he says.<p>&gt;Your arguments for why the FBI agents acted improperly amount to &quot;yeah, but it turns out that ....&quot;<p>No, I&#x27;ve responded to rayiner&#x27;s suppositions that because some activity might be sketchy, it must be.<p>[rayiner says](<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9047068\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9047068</a>) encrypting and exporting files to a repository in a foreign land is sketchy.<p>I say, ssh, gzip, and svn are pretty normal tools that programmers use frequently. So are hosted servers in foreign countries.<p>rayiner says that deleting .bash_history is sketchy, I say it&#x27;s a reasonable, nay a responsible thing to do if failing to do so would leave sensitive information (such as a password) available for others to peruse.<p>&gt;This arguments are not a good reason to not arrest someone. They&#x27;re a good reason to find someone innocent after trying them.<p>IMO if the government is going to arrest a person, attempt to hold them without bond, settle for mere $700,000 bond, (arguably depriving the person of counsel); then the government&#x27;s burden of &quot;probable cause&quot; ought to be a bit more substantial than &quot;some bros down at Goldman Sachs said...&quot;, and this guy uses &quot;subversion&quot; software. We can&#x27;t have the police running around arresting everyone who might have possibly committed a crime. There needs to be actual, you know, probable cause.<p>&gt;Sometimes circumstances are such that an innocent person looks highly suspicious to reasonable people with a reasonable amount of evidence. In those cases, it&#x27;s reasonable, though unfortunate, that law enforcement arrest and charge that innocent person. Isn&#x27;t it?<p>What do you make of the fact that:<p>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;In the New York state case, a judge ruled the 2009 arrest was illegal. He threw out seized physical evidence, including computer hardware carrying the source code.&quot;</i><p>and<p>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;New York State Supreme Court Justice Ronald Zweibel also barred prosecutors from using statements Aleynikov made to the FBI after his arrest at Newark Liberty International Airport.&quot;</i><p>Are these judges unreasonable? Sure, mistakes happen, everyone deserves a Mulligan once in a while. That&#x27;s not what we have here though. The FBI had plenty of opportunities to check their work, which was shabby. Instead of doing that, they forged ahead doing the bidding of Goldman Sachs, uncritically. And, now that the federal case has failed, GS has their hand up the back of a Manhattan DA. We can quibble about these little details more if you want but this whole affair has got a stench about it.<p>&gt;As far as I can tell, rayiner is right.... we have no evidence that Aleynikov was arrested improperly.<p>No evidence? What&#x27;s Zweibel&#x27;s problem then?:<p>&gt;<i>In a 71-page opinion, Justice Ronald A. Zweibel of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the F.B.I. “did not have probable cause to arrest defendant, let alone search him or his home.” The arrest was “illegal,” Justice Zweibel wrote, and Mr. Aleynikov’s “Fourth Amendment rights were violated as a result of a mistake of law.”</i> I have a passing understanding of the policies and procedures binding on developers at trading firms.<p>I dispute the idea that any senior developer could work at Goldman Sachs on an HFT infrastructure and believe that they were authorized to --- or, indeed, that they would not be immeditely fired for --- uploading the code to a proprietary automated trading system to a random SVN host in a different country. This is the code we, as security testers, were never allowed to see, even after owning up the machines hosting it. These firms are not kidding around about this stuff. It is a huge smoking gun to have uploaded any of it to some off-brand foreign svn host.<p>These are firms where you can be fired for plugging a thumb drive into your computer, or for using the company network to access Dropbox. I have worked for more than one financial firm that spent literally millions of dollars merely on the problem of detecting their network users trying to reach Google Mail.<p>I also dispute the idea that because developers commonly use ssh, gzip, and svn, that it is common practice to (1) gzip a tarball of source code, (2) encrypt that source code, (3) commit that compressed encrypted blob to svn, (4) remove all traces of the encryption key from their work computer. That&#x27;s something happens zero times on normal dev machines.<p>The conviction was overturned because the technical details of exactly what Aleynikov took from GS didn&#x27;t fit the ambitious charge the DOJ filed against him. But the appeal doesn&#x27;t refute the finding of facts from the original trial, which include:<p><i>There was more than sufficient evidence presented at trial, however, for a rational juror to conclude that Aleynikov intended to steal Goldman Sachs&#x27; proprietary source code. First, it was undisputed at trial that Aleynikov actually did take proprietary source code from Goldman Sachs. As Aleynikov concedes in his motion papers, the code he took from Goldman Sachs included a “purposefully designed” portion of the Goldman Sachs “proprietary, custom-built trading system.” Indeed, the evidence showed that Aleynikov took a significant percentage of the proprietary source code for that system. While Aleynikov attempted to show that there was open source code embedded within the proprietary code and to identify the files in which that might be true, his expert witness was only able to identify one file among those taken by Aleynikov that both bore a Goldman Sachs copyright banner and appeared to contain open source code.</i><p>I&#x27;m just fine with Aleynikov&#x27;s conviction being overturned. Again, the charges against him seemed ambitious.<p>But this is a forum full of software developers. Rayiner is a lawyer and a compiler developer. It&#x27;s somewhat insulting to everyone&#x27;s intelligence to pretend that people here are unfamiliar with ssh and svn. We understand how software development works. What happened here was extremely sketchy. You can&#x27;t play the &quot;well in the world of software development, this is totally normal&quot; card on HN. <i>I&#x27;m just fine with Aleynikov&#x27;s conviction being overturned. Again, the charges against him seemed ambitious.</i><p>&quot;Ambitious&quot; is a bit charitable, in this context.<p>&quot;Patently vacuous&quot; -- to an extent that suggested, at the very least, a breakdown in the internal controls and safeguards (on the part of both the FBI and the prosecutor&#x27;s office) designed to present precisely this kind of a fiasco from happening -- might be a better description. You are being ridiculous. Aleynikov definitely violated New York trade secret law. He got off the federal charge because the trading software wasn&#x27;t a product for sale, it was a product for internal use. The law was poorly drafted and once that came to light it was immediately fixed.<p>Like Rayiner said, in layman&#x27;s terms, he got off on a technicality.<p>The FBI and DOJ being on the wrong side of a close call in statutory interpretation isn&#x27;t &quot;patently vacuous.&quot; <i>Aleynikov definitely violated New York trade secret law.</i><p>That&#x27;s not what the court found. Otherwise the charges wouldn&#x27;t have been dropped.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re conflating the issue of whether he violated the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law (or whether he was, in your view, just plain morally culpable somehow) -- versus what the law actually had to say about his actions.<p><i>Like Rayiner said, in layman&#x27;s terms, he got off on a technicality.</i><p>If you want to minimize any sense of exoneration or vindication the accused might want to derive from the court&#x27;s decision, by saying he &quot;got off on a technicality&quot;, that&#x27;s fine.<p>But to claim that he &quot;definitely violated&quot; the law when the courts found that he definitely did not -- I&#x27;m just not sure I see the point in that. &gt;I have a passing understanding of the policies and procedures binding on developers at trading firms.<p>I&#x27;ve never set foot in one, but one thing I have learned watching this incident and others is that some of theses firms have varying degrees of carelessness and cluelessness within their businesses; especially with respect to IT (Knight Capital comes to mind). In that respect, they are like any other company, some careful and fastidious, some, flying on a wing and a prayer.<p>&gt;This is the code we, as security testers, were never allowed to see, even after owning up the machines hosting it. These firms are not kidding around about this stuff.<p>I may often disagree with some of your opinions here, but I can&#x27;t say that I have the impression that you&#x27;re not competent within your profession or that you lack integrity. It occurs to me that the firms that would hire <i>your</i> firm to audit them as opposed to some lesser outfit, are the same firms that run a pretty tight ship in their own businesses. Has it occurred to you that not all trading firms or even divisions within the same company are cut from the same cloth?<p>&gt;These are firms where you can be fired for plugging a thumb drive into your computer<p>Yeah, I&#x27;ve seen some companies with ridiculously conservative IT policies. I can see it being applied at a bank or a trading firm. The policies are often meaningless though, when the policies basically state that you can be fired for doing anything, but in reality that doesn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;ve worked at one of those companies where a too-large portion of engineering&#x27;s time was spent circumventing IT systems, activities for which one could&#x27;ve been fired. Those companies always have plenty of ways to fire people.<p>&gt;I also dispute the idea that because developers commonly use ssh, gzip, and svn, that it is common practice to<p>I remember about ten years ago working with an engineer whose idea of a source code revision control system was to zip up and password protect source code archives. It may not be common, and Aleynikov wasn&#x27;t doing it for the same reasons, but by itself, it isn&#x27;t proof of anything nefarious.<p>&gt;There was more than sufficient evidence presented at trial, however, for a rational juror to<p>Interestingly, none of the jurors were employed in tech, and none had a college degree. Not that it would always be necessary, but it is worth considering the possibility that none of them understood what they were being told. It&#x27;s hard for me to agree that situation was rational unless those were some exceptional high school graduates.<p>&gt;But this is a forum full of software developers. Rayiner is a lawyer and a compiler developer. It&#x27;s somewhat insulting to everyone&#x27;s intelligence to pretend that people here are unfamiliar with ssh and svn.<p>If you or Rayiner don&#x27;t like my tone, I&#x27;ll tell you that I think it is a bit of an embarrassment to have to point some of these things out here. Maybe Rayiner will have enough respect in the future not to parrot statements from the FBI&#x27;s and the prosecutor&#x27;s press releases. We&#x27;ve all been spectators here of a number of high profile prosecutions of software developers, and if there is anything to be learned from those experiences, it is that prosecutors and FBI agents will characterize the suspect&#x2F;defendant in the most damning light possible. Anything that one of them says has to be taken with a grain of salt.<p>&gt;We understand how software development works. What happened here was extremely sketchy.<p>Probably so, but not necessarily so, and not on the basis of some of the things ITT.<p>&gt;You can&#x27;t play the &quot;well in the world of software development, this is totally normal&quot; card on HN.<p>It is laughable. I&#x27;m probably one of the least qualified people to lecture to this audience, but here it is. Pretty sure my local git repository contains thousands of lines of valuable proprietary code (granted on a hardened dedicated work laptop), mixed with open source libraries etc.<p>And I also delete my bash history all the time if I do something stupid like manually enter a password into the command line.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that Aleynikov is clearly one of those rare types for whom the technology is an end in itself rather than a means toward anything. That leads to a type of naiveté about following IT security policies. I don&#x27;t know quite what the proper name is for this disposition, but we&#x27;ve all encountered them.<p>&gt;<i>I also dispute the idea that because developers commonly use ssh, gzip, and svn, that it is common practice to (1) gzip a tarball of source code, (2) encrypt that source code, (3) commit that compressed encrypted blob to svn, (4) remove all traces of the encryption key from their work computer. That&#x27;s something happens zero times on normal dev machines.</i><p>Agreed, but it was established that he did this fairly consistently throughout the course of his employment. It&#x27;s idiosyncratic, but not unexplainable. Sure, it was poor development practice, but I&#x27;m not convinced it was malicious.<p>Again, if the intent was trade secret theft, why not take the valuable part, the trading strategies? The court found that he took large amounts of &quot;the valuable part&quot;. He did more to cover his tracks than delete his bash history --- which my comment didn&#x27;t mention. I feel like you&#x27;re repeating talking points rather than addressing what I wrote. I directly quoted you in addressing your point.<p>With regard to the &quot;valuable part,&quot; financial experts will tell you that lives in the trading strategies, which <i>he didn&#x27;t take.</i> You must admit that&#x27;s very odd behavior for a malicious thief.<p>You keep trying to shift the focus to the trial, when what disturbs me and so many others is not the trial or its findings.<p>Whether or not he actually stole the code is immaterial to whether the FBI did a proper investigation prior to arrest, or whether Goldman Sachs received special treatment because of their size, wealth, and power. Your comment and mine are right there for people to see. I stand by what I just said. Agreed, and as do I. Perhaps our tone has gotten too rancorous.<p>Civil people can disagree without being disagreeable, and I know from your comments around the site that you&#x27;re a civil person, so if my tone has been less than appropriate I apologize.<p>As for the conversation itself, as you said, it stands as is, and we can let the other readers judge the facts for themselves. My concern is that the investigation of the incident relied solely upon the word of Goldman Sachs. An agent essentially parroted back what Goldman employees told him, putting it in the form of a criminal complaint, and without further investigation, had him arrested.<p>My challenge to the validity of the arrest is that there was no independent investigation performed prior. This wasn&#x27;t just contempt prior to investigation, it was arrest prior to investigation.<p>Now, I will acknowledge that probable cause is a very low standard, and it is likely that there isn&#x27;t a legal course of action here. People keep explaining how that isn&#x27;t true, and that there was <i>much more</i> than GS&#x27;s word backing the charges up, so much so that Aleynikov had to rely on a technicality to evade a conviction, one that was closed immediately after he used it:<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6978-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;27&#x2F;sen...</a> We&#x27;re arguing past one another. I am discussing the investigation and arrest, not the subsequent trial or any evidence brought to light therein.<p>If you read the complaint, the trial transcript, or even the top post here, it&#x27;s abundantly clear the so-called investigation relied solely upon the word of Goldman Sachs&#x27;s employees. The FBI agent even admitted that he did not understand the nature of the crime at the time he filed the complaint.<p>&gt;<i>&quot;McSwain later conceded that he didn’t seek out independent expert advice to study the code Serge Aleynikov had taken. (“I relied on statements from Goldman employees.”) He himself had no idea of the value of the stolen code (“Representatives of Goldman told me it was worth a lot of money”) or if any of it was actually all that special (he based his belief that the code contained trade secrets on “representations made by members of Goldman Sachs”)...The F.B.I.’s investigation before the arrest consisted of trusting Goldman’s explanation of some extremely complicated stuff, and 48 hours after Goldman called the F.B.I., Serge was arrested.&quot;</i><p>Your argument amounts to: &quot;Sure, but the guy was guilty and only got off on a technicality, so who cares.&quot;<p>People keep explaining the dire problems with this viewpoint, and I don&#x27;t know why it needs to be continually repeated. If someone steals a million dollar painting from a private gallery, you think the police should need a statement from a 3rd party art historian in order to make an arrest? If someone steals a donut from a donut shop, do you think the police need a statement from a third party donut vendor to make an arrest?<p>Silly analogies lead to silly conclusions, because they inherently obscure essential facts in the comparison.<p>This wasn&#x27;t a piece of tangible property, which the agent could understand. This was an immensely complicated issue to a lay person who admitted that he didn&#x27;t really understand what had been stolen or how much it was worth.<p>He just listened to Goldman Sachs say <i>trust us</i> and made an arrest within 48 hours.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand why its disturbing that the FBI blindly did the bidding of one of the most powerful corporations on Earth, there&#x27;s simply no point in continuing to debate the issue. Unlike donuts, art is incredibly difficult to value, so much so that there&#x27;s a whole profession dedicated to that problem. Must the FBI engage one of those professionals before deciding to arrest someone who steals a painting? Before deciding the value of the theft to attach to the charge? Certainly. That would be one reason the FBI employs art specialists as well. Absent a fleeing felon, I would definitely expect the FBI to consult with an art specialist. You&#x27;re moving the goalposts. First, Aleynikov is &quot;arrested&quot; on GS&#x27;s say-so. Now he&#x27;s being prosecuted on their say-so. By the time Aleynikov is arraigned, expertise has been engaged. What makes this an especially pointless debate is that the trial uncovers that he did in fact take valuable source code! &quot;Arrested and charged&quot;, without independent and investigation, on Goldman Sachs say-so has been consistently my point all along. Nobody moved the goalposts. You just got farther from them. <i>If someone steals a million dollar painting from a private gallery,</i><p>Except that you&#x27;re starting with a false premise: the offenses for which Aleynikov was initially charged -- theft of trade secrets, and transportation of stolen property <i>in interstate commerce</i> -- were in no way as clear cut as simply &quot;taking a painting from a private gallery.&quot;  As you are no doubt aware, from your detailed knowledge of the case.<p><i>you think the police should need a statement from a 3rd party art historian in order to make an arrest?</i><p>What the FBI (and the prosecution team) have primarily been faulted for has been their (by now obvious, if not admitted) failure to understand the basic nature of the charges against the accused -- to the extent that they missed the fact that his conduct would <i>not even have constituted an offense</i> against either statute.<p>In addition, yes, there&#x27;s the matter of how much the &quot;stolen&quot; (or rather, <i>copied</i>) bits were actually &quot;worth&quot; (or whether they could, in fact, &quot;be used to manipulate markets in unfair ways&quot;, per GS&#x27;s initial complaint.)  Should the FBI have waited to consult an outside authority to make an independent assessment of these claims before making an arrest?  That I cannot say.<p>But that both the premier criminal investigative arm of the richest country in the world -- and the highest-profile prosecution office tasked with keeping us safe from white collar crime, in that same country -- should have known that the &quot;value&quot; of copied source code just <i>might</i> be a teensy, weensy bit trickier and more nuanced to assess than that of say, an Edvard Munch painting pilfered from a major gallery in broad daylight?  Or that they should have like, you know, read the actual text of the statutes he was being prosecuted under before filing actual charges against him (and throwing him in the klink for a year as a protective measure)?  We should hope so. out of curiosity, because you and others keep repeating it as if it inherently means something obviously sinister, how did they count the 500K lines of code from a vcs repository? is it actually 500K distinct lines of code? is it a number significantly smaller that was ballooned for dramatic effect because it appears in multiple revisions&#x2F;branches&#x2F;tags, etc.? Law enforcement SOP requires an independent investigation. That was not performed. The trial is a separate issue, and has its own package of issues.<p>I&#x27;m far more concerned with the FBI acting almost as an extension of Goldman, effectively abrogating their responsibility to investigate prior to arrest to a large private corporation. <i>or modified open source with licenses that required contributing back the source code</i><p>Which license does that? No open source licenses require that.  An early version of the Emacs license did require that (I think TECO Emacs and not GNU Emacs), and there may be other licenses, but both the Debian Free Software Guidelines and the Open Source Definition based on them are careful not to require that people contribute modifications they’ve made privately.  The reasons for this are discussed in the DFSG FAQ: <a href=\"https://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html#dissident\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.debian.org&#x2F;~bap&#x2F;dfsg-faq.html#dissident</a> &gt;&gt; <i>Taking the time to confirm that the code itself is a trade secret is a monumental task, one that isn&#x27;t needed to determine if there was probable cause.</i><p>And yet the finding here is there was <i>no</i> probable cause. &quot;Goldman could be lying, but so could the shop owner who claims you drove off without paying for your gasoline.&quot;<p>Indeed, but the difference is that the FBI (or police) will arrest whomever Goldman tells them to while completely ignoring the shopkeeper&#x27;s complaints, possibly even going as far as to tell them not to waste their time. I had a police officer knock on my door one the evening looking for a previous occupant of my house who apparently drove off without paying for gasoline. This was obviously high priority for the police and I&#x27;m sure they rushed right on over to investigate. Well, I think that&#x27;s sarcasm but I&#x27;m not sure. The fact is, yes, they did send an officer to my house within hours so it seems they did take the shopkeepers word and considered it some sort of priority. Perhaps they looked at the video showing a license plate, but I doubt that they looked over the payment records to verify that the person did in fact not pay. But it wasn&#x27;t just based on Goldman&#x27;s word:<p>&gt; Then [the FBI agent] explained what he knew, or thought he knew: in April 2009, Serge had accepted a job at a new high-frequency-trading shop called Teza Technologies, but had remained at Goldman for the next six weeks, until June 5, during which time he sent himself, through a so-called “subversion repository,” 32 megabytes of source code from Goldman’s high-frequency stock-trading system.<p>Lewis weaves a lot of editorializing and red-herrings into the account, but here&#x27;s the punchline:<p>&gt; All of which was true, as far as it went...<p>Nobody disputes that at the time Aleynikov was arrested, the FBI had evidence that he had sent himself a bunch of source code and covered his tracks. And at trial, the prosecution proved that he had in fact done that.<p>So what the heck else was the FBI supposed to do? &gt;... covered his tracks.<p>He deleted his bash history. For all you know, that may have been a standard procedure.<p><pre><code>  user@somemachine.gs.com:~&#x2F; &gt;svn export --username Aleynikov --password Hunter2 --non-interactive svn:&#x2F;&#x2F;subversion.ZOMG.think.of.the.children.com&#x2F;espionage&#x2F;exportFile\n  user@somemachine.gs.com:~&#x2F; &gt;rm .bash_history\n</code></pre>\nWould you &quot;cover your tracks&quot; if you for some reason typed a password into the console of a machine that you don&#x27;t own? Realistically (loopholes aside) - all of the code not under GPL would be theft no? (Goldman replacing the copyrights on other open-source stuff with their own is probably illegal (as long as the license stipulates that the original copyright notice must remain), but their modifications are still proprietary.<p>He of course could have had proprietary source code in his repositories for work in the first place - but bundling and uploading everything does look highly suspicious - and he should have known better.<p><i>[Goldman] called the F.B.I. in haste, just two days before, and then put their agent through what amounted to a crash course on high-frequency trading and computer programming.

I&#x27;m not one of the people who would ever equate copying code to theft, regardless of intent. But Aleynikov admitted that he expected GS to be upset about it, mostly due to their cultural attitudes about IP (ie: everything is theirs). Note that he didn&#x27;t <i>&quot;bundling and uploading everything&quot;</i> he specifically avoided uploading the trading strategies code.<p>On the one hand, people seem to be giving GS a pass for stripping the copyright notices from GPL&#x27;d code they used, but taking them at their word and treating it as high treason when Aleynikov makes a copy of the modified GPL code for himself.<p>&gt;&gt; <i>&quot;McSwain later conceded that he didn’t seek out independent expert advice to study the code Serge Aleynikov had taken.&quot;</i><p>&gt;This is the very surprising part.<p>It&#x27;s just the lazy careless work of a modern day Pinkerton man. Is anyone on this thread saying that Aleynikov was wrong to copy GPL&#x27;d code? I don&#x27;t see anyone saying that. &gt; Goldman replacing the copyrights on other open-source stuff with their own is probably illegal (as long as the license stipulates that the original copyright notice must remain)<p>It&#x27;s only illegal if Goldman distributed it, which they didn&#x27;t.

It&#x27;s perfectly okay to modify GPL&#x27;ed code for internal purposes without open-sourcing the changes.<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer but as far as I understand they were stripping the copyright notice, which is explicitly forbidden by the licenses. i.e. the MIT license:<p><i>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</i> &gt; rayiner 17 minutes ago<p>&gt; The stripping clause only comes into place when you distribute the code, just as the GPL&#x27;s copy-left requirement only comes into play when you distribute the code.<p>I absolutely wish this was the case: copying internally within an organization such as a school, a church, or a business should be legal for any purposes regardless of the license something comes with... However, I&#x27;d not be very certain of support of companies like Microsoft which would argue that their copyright licenses dictate usage within the organization and not just on distribution. And no, for these purposes there is no difference between Microsoft EULA and MIT license.<p>I&#x27;d imagine you can argue that you can argue that you are in compliance if you distributed a git (or hg etc) repository with an older version that does include the copyright notice though.<p>My point is just that at what point does distribution begin? The entertainment industry wants us to believe that if I buy a CD, I am violating copyright by the audio CD to an iPod (doubly so if to a friend&#x27;s iPod). The stripping clause only comes into place when you distribute the code, just as the GPL&#x27;s copy-left requirement only comes into play when you distribute the code. &gt; The stripping clause only comes into place when you distribute the code, just as the GPL&#x27;s copy-left requirement only comes into play when you distribute the code.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. The stripping clause is a license condition with no limitation to distribution -- it expressly applies to all copies. Anything you need a license to do -- which is, anything that involves any of the exclusive rights tied to copyright (of which, the most prominent is <i>copying</i>, regardless of distribution) must follow it, barring an exception in the license or a some other provision of law that limits the applicability of the exclusive rights in copyright.<p>As well as the stripping clause of the MIT license, this is also true with regard to GPLv2 provisions related to copyright notices, which are required for both <i>modification</i> of GPL-licensed code and <i>copying and distribution</i> of GPL-licensed code, though the GPLv3 only applies this to copies that are &quot;conveyed&quot; (compare Section 2 of the GPLv2 with the combination of Sections 2, 4, &amp; 5 of the GPLv3.) Fair enough. Why does the FSF FAQ say you don&#x27;t need to distribute source if you modify the code for internal purposes. Is it an explicit provision of the license? &gt;<i>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</i><p>Where is distribution mentioned? Or, do you mean that nobody would have the chance to sue unless it were distributed, because they wouldn&#x27;t find out? &gt; he sent himself, through a so-called “subversion repository,” 32 megabytes of source code<p>One wonders whether this would have seemed less nefarious if he&#x27;d used a VCS that wasn&#x27;t called &quot;subversion.&quot; :) That part made me kind of angry -- &quot;so-called&quot; makes the writer sound like they know something we don&#x27;t, like &quot;subversion&quot; is some cool trick that smart people know. &quot;so-called&quot; here is a way of distinguishing the use of &quot;subversion&quot; as a name&#x2F;description distinction (somewhat similar to a use&#x2F;mention distinction, but not the <i>right</i> way of making that distinction, IMO, as correctly using &quot;Subversion&quot; as a proper noun would be better, though) as the common noun &quot;subversion&quot; has meaning, but the word &quot;subversion&quot; was not being used for that meaning, only as the name of a thing. Would it have? On my last day at work at Google, before I am slated to start working in the Bing group at Microsoft, I mail myself a copy of the PageRank source code. Does it matter what VCS I use? Technically no. In a court description or in a press article, both addressed to people who are not technical, the name of the VCS is important.<p>Consider the extreme case where the VCS was called &quot;theft-assistance&quot; for example.<p>How does &quot;He copied the code from a theft-assistance repository&quot; would sound to a jury that doesn&#x27;t know what a VCS is and that theft-assistance is just a name?<p>If it was something generic and inoffensive, like Git, it would be OK, but &quot;subversion&quot; has a ...subversive undertone. In a previous video posted on HN, a police officer explains how they would use a concession made by a honest humble person during an interview to boost their conviction rate: &quot;Sure, I never like the guy. But I would never do anything malicious against anyone or even animals, especially not theft or murder which is totally against my conscience.&quot; would become big uppercase red letters on a videoprojector: &quot;I NEVER LIKE THE GUY&quot;. Be sure you nail every emotional aspect to convince a jury. That&#x27;s not the point he was getting at.<p>Most people have no idea what VCS is.  To a lay person, &quot;a so called &#x27;mercurial repository&#x27;&quot; would sound far less sinister than &quot;a so called &#x27;subversion repository&#x27;&quot;.  The reality is that the repo probably had little to do with subverting anything, and was just a convenient way to transfer code.<p>I have to admit, that line made me chuckle. I&#x27;m referring to the fact that no matter how damning the evidence is on its own, it probably seems even more damning to a layperson who doesn&#x27;t know the name &quot;subversion&quot; is a pun and not something subversive. Except the code copied by Aleynikov wasn&#x27;t anything like PageRank. It was like some Go library that fetches the pages, and one that was primarily open source code to begin with. This was some initial (mis?)-information about the case, but at least according to the Second Circuit:<p>&gt;  In addition to proprietary source code, Aleynikov\nalso transferred some open source software licensed for use\nby the public that was mixed in with Goldman’s proprietary\ncode. However, a substantially greater number of the\nuploaded files contained proprietary code than had open\nsource software. Were the files source code or were they some sort of transaction logs, generated records, and what have you? Or were they various forks&#x2F;branches of mostly the same thing intended for testing?  If you don&#x27;t know then you can&#x27;t assess their relative &quot;value&quot;. <i>&gt; have someone locked up based pretty much exclusively on them saying &quot;You won&#x27;t understand why, but he did really bad stuff. Trust us.&quot;</i><p>At best that might extend to his initial arrest but not to his subsequent imprisonment. That was the result of a criminal trial that showed he violated the EEA. Which was subsequently overturned on appeal, but only because of a &quot;technicality&quot; in the phrasing of the law which has subsequently been clarified to explicitly and unreservedly criminalize the actions that he took. &gt;But help me understand what the FBI did wrong, or Goldman for that matter.<p>What law Goldman reported violation of? What law FBI investigated violation of? While one can report some alleged violation of some law, the FBI is aware of laws, especially the laws the FBI is assigned to enforce. Bringing charges under obviously un-applicable here NSPA and EEA instead of whatever (if any) law may have been applicable here is a gross negligence, to say the least, on behalf of FBI. As a result, they wasted a lot of valuable (taxpayer) resources and ultimately let the criminal (if there was real crime committed) go free.<p>&gt;The legal questions that were resolved in Aleynikov&#x27;s favor were subtle ones.<p>are you kidding? How a subtle legal question(s) can be summarized in one paragraph on an Internet forum? I would not say the EEA is &quot;obviously un-applicable&quot;. As rayiner noted, it is a subtle matter of phrasing in the law.<p>When Congress updated the letter of the law they merely rephrased &quot;included in a product that is produced for or placed in&quot;, which the court found to be not applicable to code not <i>directly</i> sold on the market, to &quot;a product or service used in or intended for use in&quot;.[1]<p>I&#x27;m not sure how well that one paragraph in an Internet forum summarizes it, but that&#x27;s literally the only change that Congress made to declare his actions illegal (should they happen again). And it was <i>at the behest of the judge who overturned the conviction</i>, who specifically noted a problem with the phrasing of the law while noting that he fully expected Congress <i>meant</i> to include these actions in the criminal code.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r112:H18DE2-0051\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomas.loc.gov&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;query&#x2F;z?r112:H18DE2-0051</a> The government got burned by a narrow interpretation of the law. Congress edited one of the laws to re-widen it after the ruling.<p>What he did is illegal now and everyone thought was illegal then.<p>He is also being charged under state law for it. It was also civil trade secret misappropriation and Goldman can sue him.<p>Like Rayiner said, he got off on a technicality. What Aleynikov did was clearly slap-on-the-wrist-worthy. It&#x27;s not like he took code and sold it to the highest bidder for zillions of dollars. It didn&#x27;t merit depleting his entire life&#x27;s savings and (almost) sending him to jail for many years. This was clearly about more than merely the value of the code he took.<p>&gt; The Court concluded that he had in fact tried to take 500,000 lines of valuable and mostly proprietary source code<p>I would dispute the value of the code. The code he took wasn&#x27;t part of the &quot;secret sauce&quot;. It didn&#x27;t contain any of the logic for actually making High-speed trades. <i>I would dispute the value of the code. The code he took wasn&#x27;t part of the &quot;secret sauce&quot;. It didn&#x27;t contain any of the logic for actually making High-speed trades.</i><p>On what basis, may we ask?<p>The only statements from the court that I&#x27;m aware of are those confirming that a significant amount of proprietary code (in comparison to the amount of OS code) was taken.<p>But not as to the &quot;value&quot; of the copied bits, or their potential to otherwise wreak havoc. I can totally believe that account.  The people at Goldman were probably totally sincere in their belief that he had &quot;stolen&quot; their magic sauce when talking to the FBI.<p>These are presumably the same kind of people that think anything that&#x27;s source code is some kind stuff that lays magical golden goose eggs, regardless of how trivial it is -- or even if it&#x27;s open-source.<p>IMHO there is a much bigger, broader problem with non-technical people in positions of influence (and even the general public!).  It&#x27;s this same kind of disconnect that leads to mountains of trivial patents being filed.  (I can&#x27;t even count how many times I&#x27;ve heard of an engineer being put in a situation where they&#x27;re told they need to patent some of their work, regardless of whether the engineer(s) think it&#x27;s worth doing.) Given Goldman&#x27;s actions, it seems to me that additional defendants in this case should be Goldman itself for misrepresenting what was actually taken, and any Goldman employees personally involved.  Additionally, those employees involved should be charged criminally for making a false statement to a federal agent. Wait, from where are we getting the presumption that GS misrepresented what was taken? There&#x27;s a meme that Aleynikov copied mostly GPL&#x27;d code, but despite Techdirt-styling reporting to that effect, the opposite turns out to be true: the court, carefully considering the notion of open-source code, found that a large portion of what Aleynikov knowingly took was proprietary and secret; along with it, Aleynikov also took confidential internal GS documentation about the connectivity their order routing system had to exchanges. I don&#x27;t completely understand the problem here. Is the FBI really expected to put their investigation on hold while they first investigate the reporter? Like, if my $X vase is stolen and I say it&#x27;s worth $X, I would hope the cops don&#x27;t waste a lot of time getting the missing vase appraised in absentia before they try tracking it down.<p>Like, hopefully the FBI obeys the law and respects suspects&#x27; rights regardless of the particulars of Goldman&#x27;s claim. If they&#x27;re not doing that, that&#x27;s a problem. But if somebody is lying to them, that&#x27;s a felony they can pursue later, right? To extend and correct your analogy, if you accuse your neighbor of stealing your vase, I would hope the cops spend some time investigating whether a) there was actually a vase to begin with and b) he actually took it, before they haul him off to prison.<p>Determining whether or not a crime has actually occurred is usually an essential part of a criminal investigation. But based on the facts of the case, the analogy is more like: you accuse your neighbor of stealing your rare Chinese vase. Evidence shows that he did in fact take your vase. He&#x27;s charged under a law for stealing historic artifacts. But after being convicted, an appellate court interprets the law not to apply because while your vase is rare, it&#x27;s not &quot;historic.&quot; Except you still have your vase, he just made a perfect copy using a Star Trek-style replicator. This is not a meaningful distinction in this case, as AFAIK it&#x27;s about misappropriation of secrets rather than loss of property, so that isn&#x27;t meant to be the same in the two presented scenarios. Didn&#x27;t the court rule that the secrets were not subject to protection under the law? It sounds an awful lot like the court ruled that no theft occurred, regardless of your definition. Read Calabresi&#x27;s opinion in the appeals court case overturning the conviction:<p><a href=\"http://tsi.brooklaw.edu/sites/tsi.brooklaw.edu/files/filings/united-states-v-aleynikov/20120411calabresi039s-concurrence.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tsi.brooklaw.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;tsi.brooklaw.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;filings...</a><p>The gist is: everyone agrees the conviction needs to be overturned by the letter of the law, and so it was, but that&#x27;s because the law was silly, which is why it was immediately changed by unanimous consent in the Senate and a 388-4 vote in the House in a bill <i>specifically mentioning Aleynikov</i>.<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/27/senate-section/article/S6978-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;27&#x2F;sen...</a> You should go back to reddit, my friend. One flaw in your analogy: The FBI doesn&#x27;t &quot;haul you off to prison&quot;. There&#x27;s a criminal trial that happens in between those two points. &quot;Jail&quot;, then. The analogy omits the thorough criminal trial process that led to his imprisonment, suggesting it was all because the FBI didn&#x27;t investigate properly.<p>In actuality he got out because an appeals court found a loophole in the phrasing of the Economic Espionage Act -- which was immediately closed by Congress <i>at the behest of the judge</i>. [1] It had nothing to do with the lack of investigative thoroughness on the part of the FBI.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r112:H18DE2-0051\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomas.loc.gov&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;query&#x2F;z?r112:H18DE2-0051</a>: <i>Is the FBI really expected to put their investigation on hold while they first investigate the reporter?</i><p>Yes, the very first thing you should do if investigating a reported crime is find out if the report is reliable. &gt; That, as the complaint highlights, the FBI instinctively acted as Goldman&#x27;s punitive arm rather than conducting an independent investigation into the facts of the case is disturbing, to say the least.<p>needs, I think, to be taken with the following quote from your linked article:<p>&gt; The Web site Serge had used (which has the word “subversion” in its name) as well as the location of its server (Germany) McSwain clearly found highly suspicious.<p>It looks like the FBI agent did &quot;[conduct] an independent investigation into the facts&quot;...it just wasn&#x27;t a, shall we say, &quot;good&quot; investigation.<p>I had intended to write that concerns about the FBI acting as &quot;Goldman&#x27;s punitive arm&quot; seem overblown, but as I was writing I think I changed my mind. While I initially thought liability would be a sufficient way of resolving this situation, the diffuse nature of responsibility here is going to make it really hard. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen instances where Michael Lewis himself has seemed to condemn the level of care in the application of government enforcement that seems to have been called for here. How can we let FBI agents get away with arresting people for using Subversion? That&#x27;s hardly an investigation into facts... more like an investigation into only the first definition of words, along with a lot of jumping to conclusions. I am for one, okay with people being arrested for using svn I&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;re making a joke. But keep in mind that Sergey was financially ruined and his marriage broke up. There&#x27;s very little humor in that.<p>Our government&#x27;s actions weren&#x27;t much different than what Putin might do in Sergey&#x27;s old country of Russia. I&#x27;m sure he appreciates the irony in that. This is one of the main problems with LEA&#x27;s as it stands today, namely the fact that while many have heard about the mass privatization of the prison system, many don&#x27;t realize that <i>effective</i> privatization of LEA&#x27;s is happening. To me this is especially dangerous because the LEO&#x27;s increasingly will end up failing to protect people from companies but will almost always try to do the opposite, in blatant disregard for their purpose and oaths.<p>Also, much of the workers rights we have today are because of workers pushing back against such tactics. I feel like the people have forgotten how we got to the 8 hour day we are at, and when we forget history we tend to end up repeating it.<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ludlow_Massacre</a> For those interested in a more detailed account, Lewis&#x27; Flash Boys is a really great book. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Michael-Lewis/dp/0393244660\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Flash-Boys-Michael-Lewis&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0393244660</a> _Flash Boys_ is a terrible book.

While the article gives some background, here is a bit more from the wikipedia article about Sergey Aleynikov [1]:<p>&gt;Sergey Aleynikov is a former Goldman Sachs computer programmer. In December 2010 he was wrongfully convicted of two counts of theft of trade secrets and sentenced to 97 months in prison. In February 2012 his conviction was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that entered a judgement of acquittal, reversing the decision of the District court.<p>The main reason why he is suing the FBI is beacause:<p>&gt;On June 20, 2014, upon reviewing the evidence, Justice Ronald Zweibel published a 71-page opinion in which the court ruled that F.B.I. “did not have probable cause to arrest defendant, let alone search him or his home.” The arrest was “illegal,” and Mr. Aleynikov’s “Fourth Amendment rights were violated as a result of a mistake of law.”[2] Besides finding that he was arrested illegally without probable cause, the court blocked the majority of evidence passed by the F.B.I. to prosecutors at the NY State DA&#x27;s office, as that property was supposed to be returned to Mr. Aleynikov upon his acquittal.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Aleynikov\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sergey_Aleynikov</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com//2014/06/20/judge-throws-out-evidence-in-sergey-aleynikovs-code-theft-case/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dealbook.nytimes.com&#x2F;&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;judge-throws-out-evi...</a> While I agree it was egregious I think people may be missing the point. The FBI is getting a huge black eye here, Goldman is already losing out. This is how our system works.<p>Goldman over reached and through their efforts got this guy arrested. That they could do that, is a problem, but now everyone involved has been thoroughly spanked (with some bonus civil case spanking as well it seems). So the next time Goldman call&#x27;s the FBI, they are going to be treated much more skeptically and the agents in charge are going to be unwilling to do anything based on Goldman&#x27;s &quot;word&quot;. Because the agents will remember this and they do not want to be the butt of interagency jokes, or up on civil liability. <a href=\"http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/215714/employee+rights+labour+relations/Understanding+The+New+Theft+Of+Trade+Secrets+Clarification+Act+Of+2012\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mondaq.com&#x2F;unitedstates&#x2F;x&#x2F;215714&#x2F;employee+rights+...</a><p>They&#x27;ve already &quot;clarified&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; that loophole.

That said, the belief doesn&#x27;t preclude non-wealthy people from getting away with passing whatever crap they want, it just says &quot;People who engage with Congress, (usually) get away with passing what ever crap they want.&quot;<p>If you are wondering how to &quot;engage with Congress&quot; the easy way is during election season but you can also visit them in Washington or at their office in your district. While some districts are quite gerrymandered by their nature the local office is often within driving distance. They also host fund raisers and that while there are some expensive ones, there are also cheap ones (like $25 or $50 a &quot;plate&quot;) since every dollar counts in a war chest. You can meet their staff at these (often quite accessible) and if you&#x27;re at all reasonable develop something of a &quot;relationship&quot; with your elected representative.

And you may very well be a member of that group. But if you are not, is there any reason that you couldn&#x27;t be their voice if you chose to?<p>The way our system works is you get out what you put in. And there are people who are unable to put in, but there are also people who can put in for them and serve as their &quot;influence&quot; in the bigger picture. People and even the news media will tell you that they don&#x27;t exist, and that the world is full of corruption and greed. That sells more newspapers I guess. But have you met your city council? Talked with them? Your county supervisors? If you haven&#x27;t because you&#x27;ve been told it won&#x27;t make a difference you have been lied to. And you can put that lie to the test by seeking those people out and putting yourself out there to help.<p>Yes, there are people with bogus motives in office. And there are good people in office. You can&#x27;t really tell who is who without talking to them though. And when you find the bogus ones and get them removed, well that helps everyone.<p>And, as I started this conversation, it takes time. And there are set backs, and sometimes the bozos win one.

Upon further reflection, maybe I should just keep using it.<p>Demonstrating that multiple people could have access to the account makes an excellent case for plausible deniability.  In the right circumstances a court could compel HN to distinguish between these users (or at least, prove that the &quot;multiple&quot; aspect is a fiction), but the existence of doubt minimalizes the professional risk.  This feels like about the right level of security for unpopular political meta-comments of this sort. Ah, but are we paranoid or in possession of multiple personalities?<p>Then again, the risk of a court is never really a risk. This is perfectly legal. :P &gt;Ah, but are we paranoid or in possession of multiple personalities?<p>Maybe for the former, the latter is true without a doubt. So you claim! I agree with them. Whoever they happen to be! I would argue that it&#x27;s not working in this case. A company was harmed financially so let them sue him. It does not need to be a criminal matter. These seem to be 2 separate points. The original post said that he was exonerated because the FBI didn&#x27;t have probable cause to search him. The article you linked said he was exonerated because the statute didn&#x27;t cover HFT systems. I guess that makes sense if the reason the FBI didn&#x27;t have probably cause was because they should have known that, even if everything Goldman alleged, he still wouldn&#x27;t have broken any laws. That seems to be the opinion espoused in the article. It was legal due to a &quot;loophole&quot;.<p>&gt; I guess that makes sense if the reason the FBI didn&#x27;t have probably cause was because they should have known that, even if everything Goldman alleged, he still wouldn&#x27;t have broken any laws.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; On December 28, 2012, President Obama enacted the Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act of 2012, which clarifies the scope of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1831-39). The newly enacted amendments are intended to reverse the recent Second Circuit decision in United States v. Aleynikov, 676 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2012).<p>The only way that statement makes sense is if the author believed that the FBI failed due to a lack of the acts alleged by Goldman Sachs being a crime. Imo, anyway. I think you&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s the only consistent way to read this anyway. &quot;the next time Goldman calls the FBI, they are going to be treated much more sceptically....&quot;<p>maybe. but I sort of doubt it. You mean Goldman calling up a friend at the FBI doesn&#x27;t count as probable cause?? The US is a pretty strange place when Bank of America can literally break into someone&#x27;s home, steal everything they own, and never suffer either financially or criminally, but all a corporation has to do is point their finger at an individual and that individual will be arrested and prosecuted.<p>It also reminds me of the AT&amp;T case where someone accessed records on public URLs and instead of AT&amp;T getting a black eye for being so incompetent the dude went to jail. When will a corporation metaphorically go to jail? They steal, they lie, they cheat, they launder money, but yet they&#x27;re always &quot;too big to prosecute.&quot; &gt;the AT&amp;T case where someone accessed records on public URLs<p>For those not in the know, that someone was weev [1].<p>1: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weev#AT.26T_data_breach\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weev#AT.26T_data_breach</a> That somebody was Jackson Games in 1993 somewhat earlier:<p><a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/SS/topten.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sjgames.com&#x2F;SS&#x2F;topten.html</a><p>(Not quite public URLs as the WWW was quite new at the time, but public information all the same.) Weev is a dick, but what he did in that specific case shouldn&#x27;t have been a interpreted as a crime, and I would have preferred his conviction be overturned on that basis, rather than the venue issue. While I don&#x27;t think weev should have gone to jail, I can&#x27;t help but think there was a sense of &quot;we have to get this guy for <i>something</i>,&quot; like locking up Al Capone for cheating on his taxes. Weev probably should be in jail, just not for that. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weev#Trolling\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weev#Trolling</a> I probably would have been OK with them nailing him for &quot;something&quot;, but the AT&amp;T case set a bad precedent. I&#x27;m uncomfortable with allowing prosecutors the leeway to just kind of decide who should be in jail based on gut judgements but I&#x27;m clearly in the minority because that&#x27;s not the way the law or politics are moving (like look at the guys getting nailed for mail fraud because of Massachusetts patronage scandals that technically were probably not illegal). &gt;Bank of America can literally break into someone&#x27;s home, steal everything they own<p>I searched but didn&#x27;t find anything about BoA home invasion. Link to story? He&#x27;s referring to <i>several</i> cases where they &quot;foreclose&quot; on the incorrect home.  They break into homes, take everything in them, and auction it off and throw away anything they can&#x27;t sell.<p>While malicious intent may be absent, to the victims that does not matter one iota. Can you cite an example for the Bank of America mention? Is it hyperbole? No, not at all. And they did it multiple times too(!). Here&#x27;s just one example:    \n<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/bank-america-sued-foreclosing-wrong-homes/story?id=9637897\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Business&#x2F;bank-america-sued-foreclosing...</a> And when they do get prosecuted, the punishment is laughable, typically a fine equal to weeks of profit, maybe months if it&#x27;s something really terrible.<p>I&#x27;d like to see how corporate behavior changes if &quot;jail&quot; was a real possibility. For a crime that an individual would get two years in prison, shut down the company for two years. They can try to pick up the pieces after that period, just like the individual. The problem with that is it would put lots of innocent employees out of work. You&#x27;d have to sell the company to a competitor or something so that the operation kept going but shareholders got wiped out. Make shareholders feel the pain and the behavior will change. I think at a minimum firing all CXX level employees and the loss of all stock options&#x2F;pending bonuses is a good compromise.  Fines harm investors, but the actual people that decide to break the law are rarely impacted. Investors should be harmed if they invest in enterprises that engage in criminal acts. Perhaps then there will be a bit more appetite for some ethics at the expense of a little profit. Not only that but you&#x27;ll get shorts interested in criminal companies because they can profit by exposing wrong-doing. And, on the other side, the market will discount a company&#x27;s stock if it is criminal which kills the executives incentives to take these actions. Hamstringing the company is going to do a lot of collateral damage to innoccents. I mean, if all CXX level people are guilty then so be it- but purely punitive beheading of a company&#x27;s leadership? Come on. Force the company to issue new shares up to some proportion of their value and give them to whoever is deemed appropriate? The same sort of thing happens when individuals go to jail. Family members lose their means of support, children lose their parents, etc. One person going to jail can potentially devastate an entire innocent extended family. That doesn&#x27;t stop us. If your actions are destroying other people&#x27;s lives and unlawfully disposessing them of their homes, then the word you&#x27;re looking for is &quot;criminally negligent&quot;.  Not &quot;innocent&quot;.<p>Nazi guards tried that defense.  Didn&#x27;t work for them either.<p>(Some of them were relatives of mine.) I&#x27;m talking about people like [Schindler](<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oskar_Schindler</a>) who was a Nazi but obviously not following orders. In a corporation with tens of thousands of employees, not all of them will have conspired to break the law. Those are the people that shouldn&#x27;t be subject to putative measures. A much better idea than that is to actually imprison all the top level executives of the company if their company commits a crime that would get an individual thrown in prison. Nono, those corporations are just rational actors, as the book of the free market tells us. Goldman Sachs was entirely within their rights to contact the FBI if they believed proprietary information was stolen from them by an ex-employee.  It&#x27;s the government (read: FBI) that screwed up here, as is most often the case. Well, yes, the problem isn&#x27;t necessarily that they contact the authorities but that they apparently have their ears. I personally think that large financial organizations should have this privilege given their role in the financial markets. They are prone to fraud and theft, i.e. a large target.<p>Except if you have some information that I don&#x27;t outside of the scope of my comment above. Just because a bank says you&#x27;re stealing doesn&#x27;t make it so.<p>Especially when the case relates to intellectual property, they have no special position in the society, and the crime may not be a crime but a civil case. &gt;<i>Just because a bank says you&#x27;re stealing doesn&#x27;t make it so.</i><p>Of course it doesn&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s the job of the FBI and legal system to determine. Goldman (&quot;given their role in the financial markets&quot;) is effectively above the law. I think that&#x27;s fine, but they shouldn&#x27;t just take everything GS says on faith. &gt;<i>but that they apparently have their ears.</i><p>How so?  Anybody can contact the FBI.<p>And when that &quot;someone&quot; happens to be a massive, multi-billion dollar bank reporting a &quot;crime&quot;, then I sure hope that they have the FBI&#x27;s ears. Well, that was a poor choice of words, but what I mean is that I hope the FBI would exercise more skepticism when they receive a report like this. I&#x27;ve reported a crime to the relevant FBI division, in which I could point out exactly where the money was went (same city, local bank) and provide proof of the fraud.<p>Action taken: none. &gt;<i>I&#x27;ve reported a crime</i><p>Your unverifiable anecdote doesn&#x27;t hold much weight, I&#x27;m afraid.  But do you really believe random-guy calling the FBI should warrant as much attention as multi-national financial institution reporting a potential crime?<p>People are complaining as if GS putting the FBI on people is rampant.  As far as I&#x27;m aware it has happened this once (though I&#x27;m open to other tales) and an over-zealous investigator tried to make a name for himself and messed it up royally.<p>I agree, what they did to this poor fellow is disgraceful, but let&#x27;s not pretend that the justice system doesn&#x27;t have a habit of railroading people when they desire a suspect.  <i>That&#x27;s</i> the real tragedy. &gt; But do you really believe random-guy calling the FBI should warrant as much attention as multi-national financial institution reporting a potential crime?<p>Well, yeah, if corporations are people with equal rights, that means that the law should treat them <i>equally</i> to other people. Magnitude of crime is different. If somebody breaks into my car in San Francisco and steals a bag, I totally expect police to laugh at me if I ask if they plan to investigate it.<p>On the other hand if young female student is raped, her newborn daughter brutally murdered and house burned to the ground, I expect half the police to be on high alert and FBI to get involved.<p>GS report of theft of software that produces billions in profits falls somewhere between these two extremes. Police&#x2F;FBI does not have resources to investigate all crimes equally so they have to prioritize. The same way as browse remote-execution exploit is fixed way faster than small UI glitch. &gt; Magnitude of crime is different.<p>The question wasn&#x27;t &quot;should a person reporting a potentially wide-ranging crime doing lots of damage and impacting potentially large number of victims be treated differently than a person reporting a crime with lesser impacts&quot;.<p>There is a difference between asking if the <i>magnitude of the crime reported</i> should result in a different response and what actually was asked, which was whether <i>who is reporting the crime</i> should result in a different response. &gt;Magnitude of crime is different. If somebody breaks into my car in San Francisco and steals a bag, I totally expect police to laugh at me if I ask if they plan to investigate it.<p>Except that I could provide a complete paper trail of where the money went (to a local scam artist) -- that&#x27;s how the financial system works.<p>It would be analogous to providing and end-to-end video of a car being stolen to a previously unknown chop shop.<p>What the police actually did would be analogous to ignoring that video but then arresting a car thief on a GS executive&#x27;s say-so. Right, so just like with people the famous rich one with a big reputation is lent more initial credence than the anonymous one you&#x27;ve never heard of.<p>Or would you put just as much faith in Joe Programmer as you would in Steve Woz? If I wanted someone to design me a cheap disk controller - possibly not.<p>But in an account of a burglary - yes I would.<p>It seems you&#x27;ve accepted that justice favors those with high status over those with low status.<p>Perhaps you don&#x27;t find that troubling. I do. Huh? My parent is upset that Joe-Random has less clout. My point is Joe-Random has no credence, which has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;high status&quot;. Woz has credence about disk controllers. Big banks have credence about finance and trading. That is as it should be. Joe-Random does not deserve equal clout on matters of disk controllers, finance, or trading. So you need to be the Steve Woz of crime victims before you should expect any law enforcement action whatsoever on a crime with an enormous paper trail? It is worth remembering that part of the case against Mr. Aleynikov involves his use of &quot;subversion&quot; software, which sounds, well, subversive.<p>From the Vanity Fair article[1]:<p>&quot;The Web site Serge had used (which has the word &#x27;subversion&#x27; in its name) as well as the location of its server (Germany) McSwain clearly found highly suspicious.&quot;<p>[1]<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;michael-lewis-goldman...</a> Wow, thanks for pointing that out.. that makes this reporting look pretty laughable, and wildly uninformed:\n&quot;..through a so-called &#x27;subversion repository&#x27;..&quot;\nApparently I can add &quot;not looking suspicious&quot; to a list of reasons to use git. Sergey must not have visited HN, because it seems safe to say had they found that in the browser history it would have been mentioned as well. Eh, I mean, the URL is news.ycombinator.com which is pretty innocuous.<p>&quot;Hacker News&quot; is just in the title of the HTML document. I would have thought the same about SVN.. When confronted with a mixture of money, ignorance and fear, all bets are off. noun\n1.\nBritish Slang. a foolish or contemptible person.<p>I would say Source Safe is your best bet. Ahh, thanks, good looking out.  &quot;safe&quot; seems like an additional layer of perceived good intentions. It could also mean you have something to hide. Something of great value. Yep, that&#x27;s about par for the course reporting.  If it sounds ominous, it must be.  I remember a small town newspaper that was all mad 10+ years ago about the master &#x2F; slave IDE toggle and how it was racist.  It was not an Onion article, sadly. This quote was not about the reporter or the news outlet.  Michael McSwain was the FBI agent in charge of the case, and the reporting seems to suggest that having &#x27;subversion&#x27; in Sergey&#x27;s Web history was a component of building probable cause. Remind me to write a a source code control system called &quot;Patriot&quot;.  I really don&#x27;t want to know what they think of &quot;git&quot;.<p>On a serious note, I guess the modern lesson is names are used by idiots to attack us so pick your project names carefully. &quot;Patriot is binary-compatible with Git ...&quot;<p><pre><code>  sudo cp &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;git &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;patriot\n</code></pre>\n... of course that is likely not enough, as all the porcelain still says &quot;git&quot;. ;) It wasn&#x27;t a small town, it was Los Angeles County.<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/11/26/master.term.reut/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;TECH&#x2F;ptech&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;master.term.reut&#x2F;</a> I thought I saw the article in some small town newspaper.  Oh well, I guess the memory isn&#x27;t quite as good.  I swear it was a weird editorial. I believe that stemmed from a lawsuit by a woman who took offense to those terms being used in some documentation that unfortunately passed through her hands. Oh god... Thanks for pointing that out, hilarious and saddening at the same time. Is the emphasis on the word &quot;subversion&quot; from McSwain, or is it from the author of the article? It&#x27;s not made clear from the text which one of them is emphasizing that part. To my ear, it seems that the emphasis comes from the FBI agent. The reporter keeps a fairly neutral voice, but the paragraph quoted, combined with the ones immediately before and after, paint the FBI agent as uninformed and credulous. I was wondering why everyone calls it svn now. I am not sure this issue has anything to do with that.  I believe it is called svn because it was replacing cvs and developers do so love symmetry. And developers love TLAs (Three letter acronyms!) I hope he can, sooner or later, put these legal battles behind him and return to programming.  He&#x27;s a pretty good Erlang coder: <a href=\"https://github.com/saleyn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;saleyn</a><p>This, in particular, is extremely useful for anyone using Erlang to interact with external processes: <a href=\"https://github.com/saleyn/erlexec\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;saleyn&#x2F;erlexec</a> Interest that after reading the wikipedia article the NY state prosectors messed up by trying to arrest him a second time. In that second arrest the judge ruled that the arrest by the FBI was illegal. Thereby giving him this opportunity for the civil case.<p>However the law is changed for future source code thefts. Here is an industry perspective<p><a href=\"http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/215714/employee+rights+labour+relations/Understanding+The+New+Theft+Of+Trade+Secrets+Clarification+Act+Of+2012\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mondaq.com&#x2F;unitedstates&#x2F;x&#x2F;215714&#x2F;employee+rights+...</a><p>The only technicality that freed Aleynikov was that the source code was not sold as a product itself. Wow, that Mondaq article is really the opposite of objective. Author Dylan W. Wiseman is really letting us know which side he&#x27;s on with gems like &quot;To correct the obvious injustice of the Aleynikov ruling...&quot; Ignoring the obvious FBI blunders and them being far too buddy-buddy with corporations, doesn&#x27;t he have a point?<p>Aleynikov intended to monetize code which was technically Goldman&#x27;s property, even if he wrote most of it. It would be a different story if he simply wanted to keep the code for archival and review purposes; he actually tried to help a startup by using it.<p>It sounds like he did violate the spirit of the law, if not the letter. After reading more into this, I agree.<p>However I would also like to add that 8 years (+3 under supervision) is bonkers and completely disproportionate with the crime.<p>Just to put that into perspective, someone could commit rape twice and be out of jail first (3 years piece approximately, or 6-7 years total).<p>It seems like as soon as a computer is involved in a crime, the sentence gets quadrupled. Instead of breaking into someone&#x27;s computer, you should just run them down with your car, you&#x27;ll likely get off easier in the latter case... Funnily enough, after reading more into this myself I&#x27;m actually going to partially retract some of my statements above.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it was definitively proven that he copied the code with the intent of helping the new startup. The evidence the FBI found was that he had the code on a laptop when meeting some of their founders, but I don&#x27;t believe they had proof of what his intent was or proof that he shared it with them or that they were even aware of it.<p>He claims he did not intend to do any such thing:<p>&gt;When he left, Sergey Aleynikov took a segment of code with him that was based on open source, but had some alterations that technically made it proprietary Goldman Sachs software.<p>&gt;According to Sergey Aleynikov, the software was of no consequence to his job at Teza Technologies, but once they realized he had taken a segment of code from their servers Goldman Sachs contacted the FBI and within 48 hours Aleynikov was in custody.<p>So I would say the sentence should be based on the proven intent. If he really did intend to use most or all of the codebase while at the startup to gain them an edge, then I think a jail sentence is fair (though I agree 8 years is way too long). Otherwise, probably not, at least depending on how accurate his story is of what % of the codebase was open source originally. I remember reading that the code was mostly open source tools that he had done some modifications to such as fixing bugs and just wanted them for reference. He hadn&#x27;t accessed the files since leaving Goldman. it&#x27;s called an editorial. sometimes people who write things have opinions I think <i>everyone</i> who writes in detail about a topic has opinions about it, they just don&#x27;t always have the decency to share them in editorials. I think Goldman Sachs was more worried that he was taking his brain with him to a competitor.  The banking cartel certainly has to be high on Silicon Valley&#x27;s list of &quot;industries that need to be disrupted&quot;.  The sad thing is he&#x27;s probably being prosecuted for things he created within the walls of Goldman Sachs and could probably easily re-create from scratch without them. Except of Flash Boys book from from the Vanity Fair article:\n<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;michael-lewis-goldman...</a><p><i>&quot;He agreed to hang around for six weeks and teach other Goldman people everything he knew, so they could continue to find and fix the broken bands in their gigantic rubber ball. Four times in the course of those last weeks he mailed himself source code he was working on. (He’d later be accused of sending himself 32 megabytes of code, but what he sent was essentially the same 8 megabytes of code four times over.) The files contained a lot of open-source code he had worked with, and modified, over the past two years, mingled together with code that wasn’t open source but proprietary to Goldman Sachs. As he would later try and fail to explain to an F.B.I. agent, he hoped to disentangle the one from the other, in case he needed to remind himself how he had done what he had done with the open-source code, in the event he might need to do it again. He sent these files the same way he had sent himself files nearly every week, since his first month on the job at Goldman. “No one had ever said a word to me about it,” he says. He pulled up his browser and typed into it the words: Free Subversion Repository. Up popped a list of places that stored code, for free, and in a convenient fashion. He clicked the first link on the list. The entire process took about eight seconds. And then he did what he had always done since he first started programming computers: he deleted his bash history. To access the computer he was required to type his password. If he didn’t delete his bash history, his password would be there to see, for anyone who had access to the system.&quot;</i> Can I just make sure that someone mentions the most powerful motive that a shop like GS <i>would</i> <i>likely</i> have?<p>HFT barrier to entry is expertise. Any firm has as their biggest competitive risk their employees setting up with that expertise in competition. It happens all the time. To counter that the optimal strategy of an HFT shop where an expert resigns is to sue them as far and deep into the ground as they can why?<p><i>As</i> <i>a</i> <i>lesson</i> <i>to</i> <i>all</i> <i>remaining</i> <i>staff</i><p>This gets an HFT shop additional barrier to entry from competition from existing experts, their own.<p>Did GS deliberately follow this optimal tactic? I don&#x27;t know, I have no evidence. Maybe the fact it is optimal for other reasons is unrelated and possibly even unknown to them. Form your own opinion on the balance of probabilities there. Couple points:<p>1. They didn&#x27;t sue him. They complained to the FBI and the government criminally prosecuted him for violation of the Economic Espionage Act.<p>2. The basis of the prosecution was that he exfiltrated 500,000+ lines of source code.<p>Doubtful this particular &quot;tactic&quot; could be more generally applied unless staff are engaging in similar activities now clearly prohibited under the EEA. I&#x27;m new to this but after reading up on the background I think this case is being somewhat mischaracterized in the comments here. I know we are all anti-authoritarian hackers at heart but HN also stands for accuracy and fairness.<p>I would say the general tone here is &quot;jack-booted FBI thugs falsely arrest hacker because their pal at Goldman Sachs pulled some strings&quot;. The implication being that this has all unravelled and he is now suing the government for corrupt trampling his constitutional rights.<p>After reading up, I would say a fairer characterization is &quot;guy who got caught stealing proprietary code got off on a technicality because the law doesn&#x27;t actually cover HFT code due to shortsighted phrasing&quot;.<p>Before you hit that downvote button, here&#x27;s my support: <i>the judge who overturned it called this out</i> and Congress passed a law in 2012 to close the loophole through which he got his conviction overturned.<p>From the Congressional Record[1]:<p>Quoting the appeals court, <i>&quot;just before his going-away party, Aleynikov encrypted and uploaded to a server in Germany more than 500,000 lines of source code for Goldman&#x27;s HFT system ..... On June 2, 2009, Aleynikov flew ..... to Chicago to attend meetings at Teza. He brought with him a flash drive and a laptop containing portions of the Goldman source code. When Aleynikov flew back the following day, he was arrested by the FBI .....&#x27;&#x27;&quot;</i><p><i>In his concurring opinion, Judge Calabresi [Cal-abress-E] directly called upon Congress to clarify the scope of the EEA [Electronic Espionage Act] as he wrote:</i><p><i>[I]t is hard for me to conclude that Congress, in [the EEA], actually meant to exempt the kind of behavior in which Aleynikov engaged ..... [n]evertheless, while concurring [in the opinion], I wish to express the hope that Congress will return to the issue and state, in appropriate language, what I believe it meant to make criminal in the EEA.</i><p>Specifically the EEA used to say &quot;included in a product that is produced for or placed in&quot; interstate commerce, which the court thought didn&#x27;t technically cover HFT code, and now reads &quot;a product or service used in or intended for use in&quot;. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the loophole.<p>If there ever was a case of violating the spirit, but not the letter of the law, this is it.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r112:H18DE2-0051\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomas.loc.gov&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;query&#x2F;z?r112:H18DE2-0051</a>: I really recommend you read the vanity fair article posted earlier.<p><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;michael-lewis-goldman...</a><p>It is quite clear that he did not violate the spirit of the law. There was no clear intent to steal any &quot;trade secrets&quot; from Goldman Sachs, and the analogy brought up in the last part of the article that compares it to taking home a notebook you&#x27;ve used for scribbling down thoughts after you&#x27;ve quit your job, is apt <i>&quot;It is quite clear that he did not violate the spirit of the law.&quot;</i><p>Very, <i>very</i> clearly, everyone from the legislature to the judiciary is in agreement that he violated the spirit of the law.<p>Even the judge who overturned the conviction said it was hard for him to believe that Congress didn&#x27;t mean for the law to make his actions criminal. And then Congress immediately updated the letter of the law, unanimously, all the while explaining how it&#x27;s unfortunate the previous letter of the law didn&#x27;t capture the spirit of what they intended, specifically mentioning this case.<p>Also, the &quot;it&#x27;s just a notebook with scribbled down thoughts&quot; analogy is poor. That implies that it&#x27;s just his own thoughts he took. He uploaded 500,000+ lines of source code, then tried to cover up his tracks. That is exfiltrating extensive, proprietary trade secrets and was repeatedly cited by Congress as just the sort of activity they wished to criminalize in the Economic Espionage Act.<p>By the way, I don&#x27;t think he should serve any more time. The sentence was too harsh IMO. But there is <i>no question</i> it is (now) illegal activity, because Congress specifically updated the law to make his exact actions illegal, <i>naming him personally</i>.<p>(Of course, they weren&#x27;t technically illegal at the time he did them, according to the appellate court, which is why he was set free.) He did not &quot;try to cover up his tracks&quot;, he did what he&#x27;d do basically every day as a normal software developer doing his job. The &quot;encrypted it and uploaded it to a server in Germany&quot; is a red herring that shows exactly how inept the judiciary was in interpreting his actions. Why does it matter that the server was in Germany? Isn&#x27;t it common sense that he would encrypt any data he uploads?<p>And it&#x27;s nonsensical to not try and interpret exactly what it is he copied and why he did so. As the vanity fair article points out, he did not in fact copy any of the vast amounts of valuable data he had access to. (He had access to everything!). But he chose tedious infrastructure code instead, to get a sense of what non-proprietary libraries that were used <i>&gt; he chose tedious infrastructure code instead, to get a sense of what non-proprietary libraries that were used</i><p>That is a generous speculation regarding his motives. As GS notes in their response to Vanity Fair, &quot;While some of those files included open source software, the Court determined that &#x27;a substantially <i>greater</i> number of the uploaded files contained proprietary code.&#x27;&quot; (emphasis mine)<p>But as far as whether what he did violated the spirit, and now letter of the law we have a conclusive answer direct from <i>Congress</i>: Yes, he did. He did not try to export trade secrets.<p>The trade secrets are the algorithms for trading. He did not touch those.<p>He took a very small amount of open source code that was mixed with proprietary code.  This code may have been illegally obtained by Goldman Sachs due to common open source licenses requiring that improvements also be open sourced.<p>He was writing a new software in a different language. He was not stealing a platform to build code upon.<p>He was a very good programmer who was underpaid and mistreated. His own colleagues were coached to make him appear guilty of stealing 100% proprietary code. The majority of the code was open source. I find that to be dishonest testimony. What exactly was the code that he copied?  I see that he did copy a bunch of code out for the purpose of collecting open-source code... but if it was code he or others wrote at his previous company, taking it seems like a bad idea. Whoever loses, we win? We already lost.<p>Stupid shit like this done by the FBI is causing tax payer money. If Sergey Aleynikov wins then guess where the money will come from...<p>I always thought people should be financially accountable for their actions. The only thing that really work, is touching the wallet. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the trend for law enforcement agencies is to shield individual agents and officers from any personal culpability. They&#x27;ll get a month of paid leave, the agency pays out and they get to return to the same position with the same pay.<p>The only lesson learned is that their coworkers, bosses and justice system will bend over backwards to make sure that they can get away with abuse and injustice without repercussions. This.<p>We tend to cheer for social justice against government abuse of power, but we&#x27;re always the ones footing the bill.<p>Settlement and damage costs should come out of the agent&#x27;s salaries across the entire organization.<p>Maybe police officers will stop shooting black teenagers if everyone on the force is docked $5000 for each application of lethal force. No, then decent cops would leave, and we&#x27;d be left with jerks who have low job-mobility (no other skills), but are adept liars who can cover their asses when they get near trouble. Most police officers already are jerks with low job-mobility - but I do think a framework where the department suffers for an individuals actions (and not the taxpayer footing the bill) would have a positive feedback effect.<p>If another officer&#x27;s indiscretion or negligence were to reflect on <i>your pay check</i>, you would be <i>less likely</i> to help cover it up or ignore it. I think I&#x27;d prefer the idea (I forget where I first saw it) that officers have to buy a bond&#x2F;insurance. That way the worst ones would price themselves out of the market. Having group rates for officers&#x2F;departments might have the effect you&#x27;re looking for. I don&#x27;t mind it terribly that local taxpayers have to foot at least some of the bill for this kind of thing. Hopefully they will be reminded come election time if a sheriff or a mayor has allowed deputies to run rough shod over peoples&#x27; rights.

    "title": "Be Careful when Speaking to Federal Agents - 18 U.S.C. Section 1001",
    "text": "The most important paragraph if you're not interested in reading the whole thing:<p>Is there an intelligent alternative to lying or telling the truth that we have not yet examined? Yes. In our hypothetical interview, you can politely decline to be interviewed by the FBI agent. Tell the agent that you have an attorney and that \"my attorney will be in contact with you.\" If the agent persists, say that you will not discuss anything without first consulting counsel. Ask for the agent's card, to give to your attorney. If you have not yet hired a lawyer, tell the agent that \"I want to consult a lawyer first\" or that \"an attorney will be in touch with you.\" The absolutely essential thing to keep in mind is to say nothing of substance about the matter under investigation. It is preferable to do this by politely declining to be interviewed in the absence of counsel. If the agent asks \"why do you need an attorney?\" or \"what do you have to hide?\" do not take his bait and directly respond to such questions. (Do not even say that you have nothing to hide.) Simply state that you will not discuss the matter at all without first consulting counsel and that counsel will be in touch with him. If the agent asks for a commitment from you to speak with him after you have consulted or retained counsel, do not oblige him. Just respond that you will consult with your attorney (or \"an\" attorney) and that the attorney will be in touch. And by all means do not get bullied or panicked into making up a phony reason for refusing to talk. You are not obliged to explain your decision to anyone. These three paragraphs also seem important:<p><i>“It is crucial to note that affirmatively declining to discuss the investigation in the absence of counsel is not the same thing as remaining completely silent. If you are not in custody, your total silence, especially in the face of an accusation, can very possibly be used against you as an adoptive admission under the Federal Rules of Evidence.<p>Your invocation of counsel, however, cannot be used against you at trial. United States v. McDonald , 620 F.2d 559, 561-64 (5th Cir. 1980). Your refusal to talk substance in the absence of counsel will force the prosecutor to decide whether your information is important enough to justify a grand jury subpoena for your testimony.<p>If the prosecutor responds to your declination by serving you with a grand jury subpoena, this will present you with an interesting range of options such as: 1) testifying; 2) refusing to testify, by invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which broadly applies to anyone , innocent or guilty, facing criminal exposure; 3) testifying (or talking to the government) only after receiving a grant of immunity; or 4) proffering to the government–that is, giving them a sneak preview of what you will tell them if they agree to grant you immunity. The important thing to remember is that declining to speak to the agent in the first place buys you time in which to weigh these alternative strategies with your white-collar criminal defense attorney.”</i><p>There are no downsides when you decline to talk, it gives you time to take a more considered approach and you can avoid errors you might make in the heat of the moment (when you are most likely stressed and maybe even panicked).<p>I will always decline answering questions, no matter the situation. There might be situations where talking is unproblematic but I don’t want to make that decision on the spot and when I’m stressed. I doubt my abilities to make right decisions in those situations. That’s why I made that decision now, and it’s to take the safest route: I decline. You've both missed the most damning sentence in the entire document:  <i>To begin with, you are not qualified to know whether you are innocent of wrongdoing under federal criminal law.</i><p>That's what ought to keep people awake at night. If the law was computer software, at this point it would be a giant unmanageable screwball of spaghetti code that would crash daily and would require patches 3 times a week. It does, both of those.  Except the patches are driven by lobbyist donations or ideological axe grinding rather than fixing defects, for the most part. So it's <i>exactly</i> like software then :) It's worse than that, if the law were software then it wouldn't even run on client machines, it'd only run on specialty hardware in the lab. if ... 1000 dollar fine<p>else if ... 5 months jail<p>else if ... capital punishment<p>else if ... licence suspended<p>else if ... 3 years jail, 20000 dollar fine<p>// handle a few million more cases<p>else you're innocent Programmatically human law may lose ourselves, insofar conceptualizing reasonability.<p>How might IT giveth direct feel?<p>/end upvote cases are rarely dismissed for this anymore: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_for_vagueness\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_for_vagueness</a> &#62; <i>To begin with, you are not qualified to know whether you are innocent of wrongdoing under federal criminal law.</i><p>In other news, barbers believe that everyone needs a haircut immediately.<p>(Both are the FUD sale.  Lawyers employ it regularly, so get used to it.) the point of having lawyer doing the talking instead of you (scroll down to the bottom of the page):<p><a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fbifile\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fbifile</a><p>\"    GOOD is AARON SWARTZ’s attorney in Boston, MA. GOOD wanted assurance that if SWARTZ was interviewed, what he said would not be used to jeopardize him. SA [REDACTED] explained that assurance could not be given but that we were in an information gathering phase. GOOD refused the interview without the assurance.<p>April 20, Washington Field Office:<p><pre><code>    CASE ID #: 288A-WF-238943 (Closed)\"\n</code></pre>\nOne phrase from a lawyer made the difference between walking the painful path toward federal conviction for computer crime and \"Case closed\". You could save a lot of money by never going to a barber and a lot of money by never speaking with a lawyer. Of course, you'll look like a fool in both instances. Slightly off topic, but it's surprisingly easy to go your whole life without going to a barber. If you want short hair, go over your head with the number 3 guard every month or so. If you want long hair, never cut your hair at all, and you look awesome after a couple years. I haven't had my hair cut in eight years. Women come up to me on the street and tell me they're jealous of my hair. It's not that hard. I'm intrigued by this, but seriously, how does one manage that much hair? There are two secrets to this. One is that you don't actually need to wash your hair every day. The other is that masculine long hair styles are trivial.<p>Washing your hair every day puts more wear and tear on it, and it's time consuming. If you have short hair, you get away with this because you keep cutting your hair long before it gets worn out. So only once or twice a week will I actually wash my hair (and use conditioner, this actually becomes important with long hair). Most days, I tie it up into a bun before showering so it doesn't get wet. You might be able to find another solution. Depending on your water quality, your hair might smell gross if you just get it wet without washing or at least conditioning it.<p>After showering, I generally brush my hair, especially after washing it or if I want my hair down. If I'm in a hurry or it doesn't look good loose, I just tie it back in a ponytail. There is literally nothing else you have to do to make it look presentable. After a certain length it doesn't really get in your face unless it's especially windy or something. If you want it loose during some sort of physical activity, I've noticed a lot of longhaired footballers will wear a thin black hairband around the base of the skull and the hairline--if you do an image search for Leo Messi or Didier Drogba I'm sure you'll see what I mean.<p>Human hair actually stops growing at a certain point, or to be more precise it grows at the same rate that it gradually falls out over time leaving you with a consistent terminal length. Mine seems to be around the small of my back.<p>As you grow it out between an ordinary short hairstyle and shoulder length, you're likely to look kind of strange for awhile, and have no good way of managing your hair. On male longhair web forums, this period is usually referred to as \"the awkward phase\". You might be tempted to get haircuts so you can at least have a decent medium length style at this point, but really that only makes the awkward phase take longer. From a short hairstyle to shoulder length usually takes within 2 years, but only the middle part of that is likely to be too awkward. From short to shaggy it just kind of looks shaggy, and from almost-shoulder-length to shoulder length it just looks increasingly awesome, but there's a bit of an awkward gap between \"nice and shaggy\" and \"almost shoulder length\" where you can't tie it back, you can't quite keep it all tucked behind your ears, and it gets in your face.<p>One last point--I suspect my hair is naturally very attractive, so I'm certainly not going to guarantee that women will approach you on the street and say they're jealous of your hair if you grow it out. Generally, most styling and hair care above and beyond not cutting it, washing it, conditioning it, and brushing it does more harm than good in the long run. The whole point about barbers saying everyone needs a haircut rings very literally true--hairstylists and hairdressers will suggest a variety of treatments, products, chemicals, cuts, and other solutions to often completely imaginary, self-solving problems like split ends, based upon completely fictional notions about the physiology of hair.<p>And that is certainly more than I ever thought I'd have to say about hair on Hacker News. The only way was to sneak it under a story about federal law. :)<p><i>self-solving problems like split ends</i><p>Could you explain that? I though split ends forced to cut one's long hair regularly. Split ends aren't even noticeable unless you look closely at the tips of the hair. And they don't travel up the hair or anything, they stay put, one side breaks off and then the other side breaks off. I've not even looked for split ends for years and I have fantastic hair. It's a total non-problem that you can safely ignore. Or you could try a sensible strategy:  Consult someone other than a lawyer/barber about when to seek a lawyer/barber. Could that just mean that \"ignorance of the law is no defense\"? Not when knowledge is impossible. &#62;There are no downsides when you decline to talk,<p>Whilst I understand the principle, I'm not sure I 100% agree with this statement. I've been in a few situations in the past - demos/football matches etc - where declining to talk would quite likely have resulted in me being detained for questioning (and in some of those cases, for others who tried this approach, this was exactly what happened), but a polite answer to the cops resulted in them simply leaving me alone.<p>It's true that had the cops decided to nick me anyway, then anything I said could well have resulted in bigger problems than if I'd kept quite. But they didn't.<p>In my view, there are quite definitely some downsides to refusing to talk, but they are far lower than the downsides could be by talking. The police isn't the same as a federal agent, although it's best to avoid talking to them too. Ah. I'm British, so I'm not really aware of there being a difference (at least one of my \"talking my way out of trouble\" incidents happened when I was working in Texas though - but it wasn't a federal agent). <i>There are no downsides when you decline to talk</i><p>Doesn't the highlighted section actually note that silence can be used against you?  It would seem you need to decline to talk and request counsel, if I understood correctly. You have the right to ask for your attorney. If you don't say anything, that might be used against you. I remember seeing this talk some time ago - simply titled 'don't talk to the police'. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc</a> yep that's a fantastic video Ah yes I remember that. Thanks for linking it again. But also note:  Part of why Bernie Madoff lasted so long was that he arrived for an SEC investigation without a lawyer.  Everyone in the room thought he had nothing to hide, so they didn't pursue him.<p>Whether we want to admit it or not:  It's ingrained that you are inviting an investigator to hassle you further by invoking a right to counsel.  (For the record:  I think that sucks too.) I'd rather not take cues from Bernie Madoff on legal matters. You missed my point:  One strategy that should be safe is telling the god's-honest truth.  But even with the truth, you invite a whole lotta hassle by bringing a lawyer.<p>Conversely: Even if you're a dishonest crook, you get the feds off your back by omitting a lawyer.<p>This is not how it should be; It is how it is. There are hundreds of thousands of people in prison right now who arrived for their interview with the authorities without a lawyer.  I'm not sure your theory actually pans out.<p>(Madoff wasn't caught when the SEC first investigated because they thought he was front-running orders, not a giant Ponzi scheme.  They were looking for the wrong thing.) I have to disagree with what you said about the SEC. According to Markopolos' book, the SEC wouldn't have caught him even if he was front-running. It's not that they were looking for the wrong thing. They just didn't look. This guy was the former chair of NASDAQ and had friends in high places. Your chances of getting the same red carpet treatment from the Feds are effectively zero. Hire a lawyer. You point is : if you're a talented con artist who was able to con $50B out, then you would mislead/charm/fend off a SEC or any other investigator better than a lawyer.  I'm completely agree with you here. For the rest of us - talk to your lawyer first. Actually, use of the word \"truth\" is itself leading. What's illegal is not lying to the government, because the government is not magically capable of telling that you are lying. What's illegal is giving the government information that the government interprets such that the government determines it conflicts with what the government determines be the official-truth. That the SEC investigators were completely incompetent helped him far more. See Harry Markopolos' book \"No One Would Listen\" for support of my \"completely incompetent\" claim: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/No-One-Would-Listen-Financial/dp/0470919000/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/No-One-Would-Listen-Financial/dp/04709...</a> One can hardly consider Bernie Madoff a paragon of astute judgment. I'll admit this is argumentum ad hominem, but his tolerance for risk was insane. Also notable is that he declined counsel when he <i>really</i> needed it, which is different than doing the same thing when you are secondary or tertiary to the investigation. &#62; this is argumentum ad hominem, but his tolerance for risk was insane.<p>That's the crucial point. The Mandoff saga reflected more on investigators abilities than on Mandoff's in my opinion. The SEC having botched 6 investigations of Mandoff so badly that even Mandoff couldn't understand it.\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/business/31sec.html?pagewanted=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/business/31sec.html?pagewa...</a> That said, what <i>you</i> say can be held against you. What your <i>lawyer</i> says for you can't so much. Which is why even lawyers may want to have lawyers. Sorry about the repeated misspelling of Madoff. It won't let me edit it now. Who's \"Mandoff\"? &#62; The Mandoff saga reflected more on investigators abilities than on Mandoff's in my opinion.<p>That is exactly the point.  Nobody shows up with a lawyer because they want transparency above and beyond the call of duty.<p>Investigators will take the need for a lawyer as having something to hide.  Arriving without a lawyer says the opposite.<p>But apparently several posters above don't believe so. I think regardless of what investigators think if you bring a lawyer, you have a much better chance of avoiding incriminating yourself (even if you don't believe you've done anything wrong!) if you bring one.<p>If you <i>have</i> done something wrong (again, whether you know it or not), you'll likely have a better outcome with a lawyer present from the start that without.<p>But if you actually haven't done anything wrong, the lawyer can still help you avoid accidentally telling a \"lie\" or getting yourself into a situation you don't know how to handle.  Even if the investigators believe you're hiding something just because you lawyered up, if you genuinely did nothing wrong, there's not much they can do... aside from making up evidence and framing you, or believing unreliable witnesses telling lies about you... which could happen in any case.<p>The bottom line (as stated in the article) is that you are <i>not</i> qualified to know whether or not you have or have not truly done anything illegal.  A lawyer will be much better able to help you make that determination and guide your interaction with the authorities for your benefit. I actually don't think you understand the parent's point. The SEC was incompetent. They weren't <i>capable</i> of finding Madoff's fraud. &#62;Part of why Bernie Madoff lasted so long was that he arrived for an SEC investigation without a lawyer. Everyone in the room thought he had nothing to hide<p>Got a source for that? Madoff ‘astonished’ SEC did not catch him, FT, Oct 2009<p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a039e91c-c5ac-11de-9b3b-00144feab49a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a039e91c-c5ac-11de-9b3b-00144...</a><p>It falls a bit short of  backing up the claim \"[e]veryone thought he had nothing to hide\", but it's along those lines. Thats bit like saying a lawyer didn't bring a lawyer to a police interview.  He had expertise and experience that would of helped him avoid common pitfalls.  Almost every normal person does not have the expertise to execute that kind of gambit properly. \"Why do you need an attorney? What do you have to hide?\"<p>I need one because it was important enough put in the Constitution. What have you got against the Constitution? In practice, such people will often threaten you.  They are experts at this, and can easily get under most people's skin.  This is why most people fold and give up their rights.  Out of fear. What if they bring you in and detain you for not cooperating with the investigation? Under some reason? Are there laws for that? Basically they take a risk when they do that, but they can only hold you for 72 hours (at least here in Toronto). There are avenues that you can take to get back at them for that though, such as class action lawsuits.<p>A Hispanic former coworker of mine was wrongfully arrested then beaten with phone books by some thugs at the Toronto police. He got lucky, it was a case of mistaken identity and even though they found a small amount of weed on him they let him go completely and he was given a card with a cops phone number on it. He has had to use it 3 times since.<p>He's an apprentice tradesman and lives in a poor area of Toronto so when I told him to sue, he said \"Sue? For what? Damages? I've been beaten up worse before by the people they're trying to catch. I live in a bad neighborhood and the officer who gave me his car and I have an understanding now.\"<p>Pretty messed up. When you don't look or sound like the people that know these little loopholes in the system you get to deal with what I consider to be a couple steps up from a mob. Some of them are awesome, for example cops have helped me get out of a snow bank before and didn't write me up for a driving infraction. Some of them are generally nice and will smile at you on the street or laugh with you as they give you a ticket, but they have power and some of them, especially those that have to deal with messed up shit in the ghettos abuse it. This is really great advice. I'd just emphasize to be honest about whether you have an attorney or whether \"an attorney will be in touch\" with him. Awesome article conover, thanks for posting. Since you have nothing to hide, is it safe to talk? There can still be real danger in speaking to a government agent in these circumstances. To begin with, <i>you are not qualified to know whether you are innocent of wrongdoing under federal criminal law</i>.<p><i>Critical system failure.</i> There should be red lights blinking and klaxons wailing. Also, if you say something inconsistent, no matter how trivial, whether it has anything to do with the alleged crime or not, even if you are completely innocent, it will likely destroy your credibility in front of the jury and thus they will believe whatever paranoid fantasy the prosecution makes up.  It could be something as trivial as you came back from your trip two months ago in the afternoon not in the evening as you had claimed, for example. If you say something inconsistent, you've lied to a federal officer, which is itself good for a prison term, as Martha Stewart learned (leaving aside the actual lie, which if I recall correctly was asserting that she did not do something which they couldn't get enough evidence of her doing to convict her for it...). \"Ignorance of the law excuses no man: Not that all men know the law, but because 'tis an excuse every man will plead, and no man can tell how to refute him.\"\n- John Selden<p>I'm not defending the ridiculously complicated U.S. Code but, even if it was much simpler, there is no way you can honestly say, \"I know I did nothing illegal.\" That's a subtly different point.  Its ok that ignorance of the law can't be used as a defense.  That an honest person who attempts to study the law so that they can comply with it has basically no chance of succeeding is the problem. Short of some form of becoming a lawyer, what percentage of the general population, or even just those following HN, have ever read a nontrivial amount of actual law? any laws at all?<p>(Took me years to comprehend just NY weapons laws.)<p>Ignorance of the law is the norm. When the laws one is subject to can be measured in cubic yards, something is awry. Contrast with the entire US Constitution fitting on one piece of paper. I spend a considerable amount of time studying case law and I can say confidently that I have no idea whether I am committing a crime even doing something that seems to me to be completely innocuous such as sitting in my office posting on HN right now. In fact, I suspect I probably am in some obscure way that never occurred to me. Actually, there is a way that occurs to me. The article said \"if you lie to your employer on your time and attendance records and, unbeknownst to you, he submits your records, along with those of other employees.\" My employer does have some government contracts and it's possible I am not supposed to be using the computer for personal reading. Perhaps my time now, even though after a solid 8 hr day, accounts by percentage of total work per day which is being reported to the government. By posting on HN I am defrauding the government of the taxpayer's hard earned cash. So actually I probably am committing a serious crime, see, I didn't even have to think to hard to come up with a possibility. Maybe someone will say this is not a crime, but how can they really know? Just because I haven't been charged yet doesn't mean this isn't illegal. Now the rest of life is the same way. It's possible that every minute of the day some crime is being committed unwittingly by myself. Talking to police and saying anything at all virtually guarantees that they will be made aware of some sort of illegal activity that I am engaged in. Perhaps I watered my lawn at the wrong hour. Maybe I failed to signal before changing lanes. Maybe I accidentally threw away a lithium battery that wasn't supposed to go to the landfill. Three Felonies A Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent by Harvey Silverglate: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/...</a><p>\"<i>The average professional in this country wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes home, eats dinner, and then goes to sleep, unaware that he or she has likely committed several federal crimes that day. Why? The answer lies in the very nature of modern federal criminal laws, which have exploded in number but also become impossibly broad and vague. In Three Felonies a Day, Harvey A. Silverglate reveals how federal criminal laws have become dangerously disconnected from the English common law tradition and how prosecutors can pin arguable federal crimes on any one of us, for even the most seemingly innocuous behavior. The volume of federal crimes in recent decades has increased well beyond the statute books and into the morass of the Code of Federal Regulations, handing federal prosecutors an additional trove of vague and exceedingly complex and technical prohibitions to stick on their hapless targets. The dangers spelled out in Three Felonies a Day do not apply solely to “white collar criminals,” state and local politicians, and professionals. No social class or profession is safe from this troubling form of social control by the executive branch...</i>\" Don't forget all of the stuff that you can <i>not</i> do that will also land you in the klink. Damned if you do damned if... never mind, just skip right to damned. Which is an excellent reason for a trail by jury.  It leaves open a chance for a jury to decide \"this is bullshit!\"  There's of course a legal term for that, but I'll be damned if I remember it, IANAL and all... I believe you're thinking of jury nullification. I had a collage assignment where I read a fair amount of laws relating to computer crimes.  The problem is not reading the law it's lacking the context to understand what it means outside of the most trivial cases.  Consider, if you sneeze and cause a traffic accident other factors are far more important than the sneeze, but in some cases it might reduce your culpability. An honest person can attempt to do that, and they are called \"lawyers.\" Again, it is <i>way</i> too easy to run afoul of the U.S. Code. I get that. But, even if that wasn't true, it would <i>still</i> not be advisable to speak to law enforcement officers. <i>An honest person can attempt to do that, and they are called \"lawyers.\"</i><p>I am in law school right now, and the first thing I learned is how little I know, the second is how little I will know about the entirety of the law when I graduate.<p>More recently I started realizing how quickly even law professors and experienced lawyers will plead ignorance (or at least state they need time for research) when you ask questions even slightly outside their specialty. The definition of \"lawyer\" is not \"a person who earnestly tries to comply with the law.\" Lawyers have a particular role in the legal system that goes well beyond merely being a law-abiding citizen. The definition of \"lawyer\" is \"someone who has graduated from law school\" while \"attorney\" is \"someone who is licensed to practice law.\"  There are people who are one of those things but not the other. In America, a lawyer and an attorney are one and the same; both refer to licensed practitioners of the law.  You do not come become a lawyer merely by going to law school (except in Wisconsin, if you go to a law school in Wisconsin).<p>People who graduate from law school but who do not become licensed to practiced are referred to as \"law graduates\" or \"JDs\" (after the degree). Even a lawyer would have to be superhuman to achieve that, unless we extent his being to include a law library and his colleagues. &#62; Since you have nothing to hide, is it safe to talk?<p>Since you typically have nothing to gain by talking to law enforcement, why would you? It's all downside. The problem is if <i>nobody</i> talks to law enforcement, it's going to be very difficult for society to function properly. Tell them: \"If you really feel that way, you can always write your local congressman to repeal 18 USC Section 1001. Until that law is removed, I really do not have a choice.\" Eh, you can always drop dimes anonymously if you know something. (I mean, you can now. Hopefully that will remain possible.) And there will always be people who talk to the police; they're just people with a tenuous understanding of risk versus reward. I think the problem he is addressing is that third parties  suffer due to inefficient investigation if you are a witness of a crime. Well said. It's not like you get brownie points or cash if you talk to them, give them helpful information, or prove your innocence. This advice also applies to any situation involving law enforcement officers, not just federal agents.<p>Remember, \"Don't Talk to Cops\": <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8z7NC5sgik\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8z7NC5sgik</a> So let's say a kid goes missing. The cops come around the area she was last seen asking people if they saw her. They are trying to narrow down where and when she disappeared.<p>Everyone else is cooperative, but I'm not.<p>I've now drawn attention to myself and am probably going to be in for a lot of scrutiny, and at some risk for getting into trouble even if I had nothing to do with the girl's disappearance. According to many competent advisors (such as in the don't talk to police video), the problem here arrives when it turns out that a security camera shows that you did see the girl. You said you didn't, but the video proves you are lying. Of course you will say that you didn't realize you had seen her or you thought they meant a different girl. Of course that is exactly what her kidnapper would claim, strengthening their case. Now they have probable cause to arrest you. Since you feel you have nothing to hide and it's all a misunderstanding, you answer their questions, but your memory is wrong several times. Now it's looking really bad and they are telling you if you just tell them where the little helpless girl is buried so that the parents can have some peace, they'll ask the district attorney to consider taking the death penalty off the table.<p>All could have been avoided by saying \"I'll have my attorney contact you\" and later he contacts them with the message \"Mr. TZS knows nothing about this case as far as he knows.\" They wouldn't have probable cause to arrest me in the hypothetical you give. At best they would have probable cause to bring me in for questioning (at which point I'm getting an attorney), or to perhaps get a warrant to search my home (depending on just what the security camera shows).<p>If I were to take your suggestion and avoid the initial question by having my attorney answer it--nothing changes because they still have the security video showing I saw the girl, so now they will just think I'm lying through my attorney install of lying directly, and I'm still going to end up getting brought in for questioning and possibly have my house searched. &#62;nothing changes because they still have the security video showing I saw the girl, so now they will just think I'm lying through my attorney install of lying directly, and I'm still going to end up getting brought in for questioning and possibly have my house searched.<p>you seems to miss the point of getting an attorney. Two things:<p>Presumably the comparison of what you say vs. what the video camera shows will happen after when you talk (plus if they know you've seen her their approach to you is likely to be different).<p>You lawyer will presumably know how word your statements so they are both true and won't get you caught in this sort of scenario.  I'm not sure what works for real, but think of the difference between the statements \"I didn't see her\" and \"I don't recall seeing her.\"  Both say the same thing, but the former is obviously more dangerous.<p>Again, it comes down to the question of \"What's in for you?\"  Nowadays there's pretty much nothing but downsides for you with no upside aside from the occasional situation where saying something will avoid your getting taken in for questioning or worse.<p>This is something that comes up a lot in the concealed carry/self defense community.  Missouri requires a thorough 8 hour course to get a license and the one I attended was taught entirely by police, most or all of them still active in one way or another.  Their advice, and they said they didn't like saying this---and I'll note SW Missouri is <i>very</i> favorably inclined towards legitimate self-defense---was that you shouldn't talk to them but retain a lawyer and speak through him. It's probably best to avoid the police if possible if you have no information to offer. If you do have information, you can talk with a lawyer about the right way to present it, or take sufficient steps to make yourself anonymous (perhaps by having your lawyer perform all communication).<p>I do agree that in cases like that, you will make it harder for yourself if the police stop and ask you and you refuse to say anything. I think the talk linked refers more to people who are considered potential suspects rather than witnesses. Never means never. Watch the video, it's crystal clear.<p>What everyone else is doing doesn't matter. You can't talk your way out of being investigated. &#62;if I had nothing to do with the girl's disappearance.<p>care to elaborate how your talking would help then? Telling them something like \"Yes, I saw the girl ride by on her bike this morning while I was getting the mail--I don't know the exact time but I usually go get the mail around 10ish\", or \"Sorry, Officer, but I was indoors most of the day and don't recall seeing anyone go by\" or similar things helps me because it makes me fit into the herd (the rest of the neighborhood).<p>Being the only person who won't make such a simple statement is practically shouting out \"INVESTIGATE ME! I SHOULD BE A MAIN SUSPECT!\". At the very least that will lead to considerable hassle and expense. Again, with this scenario you don't realize they have a security video of her a mile away at 10ish. You actually saw a different girl, but since you testified you saw her at 10 at a certain location and they have proof she wasn't there, that proves you are lying and have something to hide. Clearly you are the killer who has inserted himself into the investigation with the goal of misleading them. What do you mean \"again\"? That's <i>your</i> scenario and it and even its variations are rare. In the likely scenario, you stand out like a sore thumb every single time.<p>Whenever this comes up on HN, I find the pattern of comments to be a little baffling, in that very few people want to acknowledge that there are significant downsides to this.<p>One that isn't mentioned is that, frankly, I don't trust cops nearly as much as you'all seem to. I've been in dodgy situations with cops. I've been pulled over by cops on a dark, out of the way road, and it made me nervous. There is zero chance I'm not cooperating with him as much as I can under those circumstances. I believe that would be a good case for driving the normal speed until you get to a well lit area. If you want, get out your phone and inform the police of your intent.<p>I would never pull over on a \"dark, out of the way road\". That could get you arrested: <a href=\"http://www.insideedition.com/news.aspx?storyId=371\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.insideedition.com/news.aspx?storyId=371</a> Might be why I've heard the advice of informing 911 of the situation. They would tell the police officer, and everything would probably be ok.<p>&#62; Mary Ann Viverette, the President of the International Association of Cheifs of Police [...] but she also thinks Karen was smart to follow her instincts in that situation. Finding out afterwards that you're the last person to see her doesn't have as much upside as you think it does. This is exactly what the police would say to get you to talk! Indeed. Notable from that video is the fact that the police <i>may lie to you</i> when trying to get you to talk. Is general many of these things sound like reasonable law enforcement rights to me, but not that one. First off, the issue is not how it would help <i>them</i>, it is how it would help <i>you</i>. And tzs explained how it would help you: it would keep the investigators from getting suspicious of you, and possibly making your life harder.<p>As an aside, it would also help the investigators, by not distracting them with irrelevant suspicious behavior. i guess you didn't watch the youtube link flying around. Otherwise you'd understand how slight mistake in your talking - you washed your car on Tuesday, not on Wednesday 3 weeks ago - would _help_ you in that investigation and \"keep the investigators from getting suspicious of you\".<p>&#62;As an aside, it would also help the investigators, by not distracting them with irrelevant suspicious behavior.<p>and that too. If they don't have any evidence against you, drawing attention to yourself does absolutely nothing to get you into trouble. If they do have evidence against you, they were going to crucify you with or without your help, and refusing to say anything makes it harder for them.<p>What you really need to weigh it against is the fact that you don't want crimes to happen in your community. I think the thing to do is pay attention, and as soon as they seem to go from talking to you as a witness to interrogating you as a suspect, shut the fuck up. If you are a suspect, they might start off treating you as a witness so you lower your guard. Don't lower your guard, be careful to only make true statements (\"I don't recall X\" is always better than \"I didn't do X\" or \"I didn't see X\").<p>From personal experience, being questioned by police is very, very draining and difficult, especially when you are innocent. And they're assholes when they question you. Like everything in life, it's a matter of risk/reward. /shrug. They should make this required viewing in high school civics classes. do they even have those any more? They're more likely to show you a video saying 'Trust all the cops all the time!'. The most rational strategy for a US citizen is to treat an officer like the worst enemy, a sleazebag who will go out of their way to fuck said citizen over? There is something deeply wrong with this country. It's not the officer personally, but there is a massive impersonal system of wheels and gears turning to result in him contacting you. It's easy for an innocent person to get sucked in and crushed by such machinery. What reason is there to assume any differently?<p>For that matter, what advantage is there for <i>you</i> to assume any differently?  (tip: there is none.) That's his point.  In a well run society, this would not be the case. <i>In a well run society,</i><p>Who is running society?<p>Half my reason for asking is to be a smart-ass, but the other half is to ponder:<p>Might the problem be that somebody or some group thinks they have (a) the authority, (b) the ability, and (c) the necessary information, to run our lives? I agree.  I think in general the absolute best societies can only happen when authorities step back and let people do as they think is best.  The paradox is that this can also make it possible for the absolute worst societies to form.  It depends on the way individual people decide to regulate themselves.<p>Personally, I like the idea of anarchy in an attempt to get the best society possible even if it results in a less perfect one in practice. It doesn't matter how fucked up or well run the society is.  So long as the justice system is implemented anything like it currently is this will be the case. Oddly enough I was thinking about this very thing today. IN a society, laws are established to invoke precision, but people tend to operate on generalities. For example, speed limits on roads have to be a precise number so that there is an established standard, and in general a cop won't pull you over for doing 37 mph in a 35 zone. However they technically can throw the book at you if they want due to the precision of the law.<p>I don't know how this can be fixed though. At the moment we have to rely on judges to save us from the precision of the law, and we all know that judges can be just as corrupt/resentful/bored/petty as the rest of us. I think that is not true in general.  Consider, for example, the charge of reckless driving.<p>I think (although have no data) that there are probably more laws requiring human judgment than are based on strictly numerical criteria.  Off the top of my head, the various degrees of murder, perjury, hate crimes, divorce settlements, and probate court.  These all may have very specific criteria to meet them, but there is no way an algorithm could determine innocence or guilt.<p>The only numerical laws I can think of are speed limits  and the lines between grand theft / theft. A good test might be, \"if every single person obeyed this law strictly as it is written, would society still operate the way we intend?\" (c.f. <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Work-to-rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Work-to-rule</a> ) The justice system in most of Europe is implemented based on the same principles. I wouldn't have any qualms about talking to a German or French cop or national security agent. You are <i>seriously</i> deluding yourself if you think that the situation is better in Germany or France. Just for instance, evidence found in an illegal search is valid in German courts. This is abused by German cops all the time. And just as in the US, there are almost zero repercussions for this kind of stuff. And most people don't have any qualms about talking to American cops.<p>That doesn't mean a thing. An officer is trying to gather evidence against someone, whom they have strong reason to believe is guilty.  If the most expedient means for this is to threaten to fuck you over, they will do it. The words \"threaten to\" are extraneous. Agreed, it's incredibly disappointing. But I've seen it firsthand, so, thank you but I'll be contacting my attorney before continuing to speak. what bothers me the most about these kind of articles is the underlying assumption that I can find a good criminal lawyer when the need arises.<p>I'm having enough trouble finding good engineers, and that is something that I am qualified to do, as well as able to spend several months on, under very little pressure.<p>I have very little experience with lawyers, but at least for corporate lawyers, my impression is that the average lawyer  doesn't know everything about their field, just like the average programmer doesn't know everything about <i>their</i> field. I wonder how many of these pitfalls are something that an average lawyer wouldn't know to avoid. Yeah, no kidding. I just walked (stumbled) through a short-sale turned Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure. If I had a dime for every time they told me that I should consult \"my attorney\", I may have actually had enough dimes to afford one. I finally did ask, \"do you actually talk to middle class people like myself that keep attorneys and accountants on retainer?\" I mean the whole point of the process is that I could no longer afford to pay for my mortgage, wouldn't it be a little suspect if I were able to afford an attorney??? Here's the solution. You need at least one good lawyer in your life that you trust. You must have an attorney that has set up your investments, your estate, perhaps a family attorney that helped your parents. A competent, honest attorney. These are hard to find so like with a good car mechanic when you find one you hold on to them and treat them well.<p>Now when you need a specialty attorney at short notice because you've been arrested for murder or are being sued for patent infringement you ask your trusted attorney for a recommendation. The recommendation will go to a good attorney and not the fly by night shyster that advertises at 2AM on the local TV station. This attorney may be extremely expensive of course, but this is how I have found specialty lawyers at short notice. It is critical you have a trusted attorney that you have a relationship with though, otherwise you risk ending up flipping through the phone book at the jail some day. How would I find such a lawyer?  So far, the closest I've ever come to needing or wanting an attorney is when I bought my house.  At this moment, the only outstanding legal issue I can think of is that I need a will drawn up.  Is that sufficient for approaching a lawyer and \"seeing how it goes?\" Yes, that's a good start, if in most US states you'll want a living trust set up in addition to a will which avoids the legal costs of probate court for your heirs. Last time I changed towns I went through three lawyers to talk about setting up a living trust in the new state. The first three had serious issues. The fourth didn't and is now my basic  attorney. I think batting 0.25 isn't bad all things considered, it really is like looking for a good contractor or mechanic, most of whom are either not competent or are dishonest. But there are always competent honest people out there if you can find them. Competent, honest and cheap you can't get. You'll have to pick 2. Once you have a professional you know you can trust, stick with them.<p>It's not possible to just pick a good one randomly the first time yourself except when you are lucky. However, it's not any more difficult than getting a good mechanic, which is why I keep using that analogy.<p>I should mention that when in a new town do not trust recommendations made by others who are not professionals who work in the system as peers. Others will recommend their friends or relatives, or someone that helped someone they know in a bind once. This is very different from the high respect of an honorable peer, which is why you want a good attorney to be recommending the specialty lawyer and not your coworker, pastor, or waitress.<p>Consider the $800-$1500 you'll spend on a routine living trust a down payment on a good lawyer. It's something I've wondered in the past as well. There are pretty good odds that every single person has broken at least one law in their lives, and as surveillance and storage capacities increase, it's only going to get easier to dragnet them if you need some leverage on a person.<p>There seem to be at least a couple of companies that offer legal services insurance[1][2], but it's difficult to tell from their sites if they cover criminal/potential criminal interview services under the circumstances described in the article.<p>I also have no idea what sort of price you'd expect to pay.\nThe ARAG Legal Calculator suggests ~$5k for a misdemeanor, but they've got something of a conflict of interest in quoting prices.  Their stat of $283/hr average seems to be sourced though.[4]<p>I think there are some free(ish) options, the UK has Legal Aid[3], and I think in the US there's some Public Defender provisions (although you might have to be already under arrest for that to apply).<p>I'd imagine there's definitely some sort of market opportunity for connecting people to competent legal advisors quickly.  Ideally something usable with your \"one phonecall\".<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.das.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.das.co.uk/</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.araggroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.araggroup.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.legalservices.gov.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.legalservices.gov.uk/</a><p>[4] \"Average attorney rate in the United States of $284 per hour for attorneys with 11 to 15 years of experience, Survey of Law Firm Economics, Incisive Legal Intelligence, July, 2009.\" One thing you can say which the officers are legally obliged to contend with (I think) is that you refuse to make any statements without consulting your state appointed attorney. The government is required by law to provide you an attorney if you can't afford one.<p>(IANAL) If you can't afford one <i>and</i> you are make less than a low threshold above the local poverty limit.<p>The test looks at assets and income, ignoring liabilities (except for necessary ongoing medical expenses). To add to that, I believe it's mainly for criminal charges, there are other legal situations in which you may not be provided a lawyer (income limits or not). An example would be a civil forfeiture where you could have assets seized and whether you can retain a public defender or not is up to the judge, not a right. My thoughts exactly.<p>However, I just assumed I was being too cynical. <i>For example, if you lie to your employer on your time and attendance records and, unbeknownst to you, he submits your records, along with those of other employees, to the federal government pursuant to some regulatory duty, you could be criminally liable.</i><p>Is there anything in the law that makes the \"pursuant to some regulatory duty\" relevant here?  For example, if you wrote something on Wikipedia that you knew was inaccurate, and years later a federal official read it and found it somehow relevant to his job, would you theoretically be breaking this law? IANALOAJ, but yes, technically that would be a crime in those circumstances. It seems unlikely you'd be prosecuted of course but who can say? Yes.  It's not criminally illegal to lie to your employer about hours worked.  On the other hand, if you're lying to your employer about hours worked on a government contract, that may be a different story.<p>What most armchair lawyers forget (or never learned) is that intent is a fundemental element for any crime involving more than token (i.e., small fine) punishment. In the example above, if you don't intend to defraud the federal government when lying to your lawyer, it's not a crime. When members of congress lie when speaking to other members of congress, why aren't they held to this law? The government, and its agents, are exempt from most laws. How so? I can't think of where that would hold true, aside from certain liability issues and other circumstances where it would be impractical or contrary to the public interest. Because the government is sovereign entity and can only be sued if it allowed itself to be sued. In fact it is exactly the opposite, the government allows itself to be sued in some tort cases (the liability you mention), in some cases involving IP, and even there you don't get a trial by jury -- a federal judge will decide if the federal govt. is guilty or not (yeah I know...). Right but we're not talking about lawsuits. We're talking about criminal law and government agents being bound by laws. They have Constitutional immunity for anything they say in either house of Congress: \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place\" (Art. I, Section 6). For an Australian example -- a senator recently named a Priest accused but not charged of rape.  <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-13/xenophon-names-alleged-sex-abuse-priest/2897744/?site=melbourne\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-13/xenophon-names-alleged...</a><p>Said in Parliament as otherwise it could be considered defamation (ie -- The priest has not been proven guilty in a court) Perhaps because they write the laws? Article One, Section Six of the constitution protects legislators from prosecution for what they say on the floor of the houses except for sanction by the legislature itself.<p>&#62;and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_1:_Compensation_and_legal_protection\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_State...</a> It saddens me that the best advice for so many situations is \"Get a lawyer\". Besides the fact that they are expensive I find it frustrating that society has become that adversarial. No, it's not society that has become adversarial, it is the vague and far-reaching laws. Tangentially related - <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26nocera.html?pagewanted=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26nocera.html?pag...</a><p><i>In March 2009, still unsatisfied, Mr. Nordlander persuaded his superiors to send an attractive female undercover agent, Ellen Burrows, to meet Mr. Engle and see if she could get him to say something incriminating.

It may be extreme but as someone who has witnesses this type of thing go down, I live with the knowledge that we are all one false accusation away from complete ruin.  EVERYTHING can be made to look malicious and calculated, and we should all, in this context, live in fear of the government.  Stay out of their crosshairs and keep your attorney phone number close by. This is an interesting and useful perspective, and it's not the first time it's come up on HN, but it's unfortunate that it doesn't draw any thoughtful criticism.<p>This advice is best when one is implicated or thinks there's any chance they'd be implicated...but then anyone with the slightest awareness of the legal system learns about this at a pretty young age. This particular advice gets its sensationalism and counterintuitiveness by claiming that it's a universal rule. As a universal rule, it has its downsides.<p>One downside is that, if everyone does this, we make it far harder for law enforcement to do worthwhile investigations. Programmers hate when roadblocks prevent us from iterating quickly during development. Understand, other occupations also suffer from the same crunch on their time that we do and, as a community that's all in this together, we benefit from their work.<p>Another downside is promoting an adversarial role between law enforcement and its citizenry. This is an intangible, but I think its costs are real.<p>Also, you'd better be very confident that the cop(s) will simply respect your rights under the law. I know of situations where that has not been the case. I've seen videos where it wasn't the case. We've all read stories where it wasn't the case.<p>It's easy to fantasize stories about you being wrongfully singled out or, heaven forbid, convicted. We've also all read stories about that. Just like everything in life, then, it's a cost/benefits analysis. But don't pretend that one choice is all benefits and no costs.<p>I think the speed of modern news dissemination is warping our risk assessment software. Things that you'd only hear of rarely are reported several times a day now, because there's 6 billion people having bad things happen to them, the news only cares about those bad things, and our attention for those bad things is the same size as ever. The bad things per attention minute is rising all the time. Partly because of this, and partly because we are the way we are, there's a penchant by some in my geeky, libertarian community to withdraw as citizens, and overestimate downside risk. Yes, you expose yourself to risk by rescuing that drowning man; yes, you expose yourself to risk by finding that lost girl's mom; yes, you expose yourself to risk by cooperating with authorities. And, you know what, I think it should be worth it to you.<p>As a side note, attorneys are very familiar with the system and feel confident about fighting it head on, and many attorneys are willing to lead a high stress, confrontational life style. One should bear that in mind when taking advice about how to lead one's life. &#62; <i>Another downside is promoting an adversarial role between law enforcement and its citizenry. This is an intangible, but I think its costs are real.</i><p>This is caused by law enforcement/state prosecutors taking an adversarial role against citizens, not citizens responding in kind.<p>It's like the classical prisoner's dilemma. Yes, it would be better for all involved if everyone chose to co-operate. But when one side persistently takes the adversarial approach, it would be stupid for the other side not to do the same.<p>&#62; <i>As a side note, attorneys are very familiar with the system and feel confident about fighting it head on, and many attorneys are willing to lead a high stress, confrontational life style.</i><p>This is, in fact, why you should always talk to an attorney when it comes to dealing with law enforcement. There's a new book out about the complexity of American law. It's titled \"Three Felonies A Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent\" by Harvey Silverglate<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/...</a> This is an unjust law, period. Now <i>that</i> is the core issue here. Not that there is something wrong with \"the system\" or that law is \"too complicated,\" but that this law is unjust. This law is broader than I'd prefer but I don't see how it's clearly unjust. Do you feel the same way about perjury? If not, what's the dividing line between the two? Perjury requires you to be giving testimony under oath. This law covers any and all conversations however casual.<p>Furthermore perjury requires the act to be willful and the item under question to be of material importance to an investigation. This law requires only that the statement be known by the speaker to be incorrect and however trivial. Perjury is essentially a violation of a contract (the contract being the sworn oath), so of course it's a legitimate offense. To me, it comes down to the context in which you make your remarks. If you're under arrest or under oath, then I think lying should be prosecutable (because, in these situations you have the right to remain silent and the right to not incriminate yourself, and you obviously know you're talking to legal officials). Lying is a pretty common reaction of some people to stressful situations, especially when they have something to hide. If you are testifying at a trial, you will have had time to collect your thoughts and prepare yourself for the situation, but that isn't the case if an FBI agents shows up at your door and starts asking questions. The law needs to allow for people to be human. Wait, so let's say I'm at the post office buying stamps, and I hand the cashier a $20, and she says, \"Don't you have anything smaller?\" and I say no, even though I do, because I want the change.<p>Could I be convicted under this law? I think the law is only applied when it's in relation to a crime, but it is an interesting thought and shows how an overly broad law could be easily abused. It is unlikely you would be convicted, but yes, you have violated that law in the circumstance you describe. If the cashier is a federal agent. I'm pretty sure all USPS employees are. I thought USPS is a \"private\" company, just heavily regulated.<p>Edit: Never mind.  It has a complicate ownership, as a US government-owned corporation.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service</a> No, nor have you broken the law as it is written.  The key factor here is that the statement must be made about a matter in which a federal investigative or regulatory agency has authority to pursue legal actions, i.e., in relation to an investigation into violations of federal laws or regulations.<p>What the discussion on HN ignores (and which the article touches upon but glosses over) is that the lie (about hours) is <i>repeated</i> to a federal agent during an investigation or on court.  The repetition is the illegal act.<p>I am a lawyer...and I would really love it if the armchair laywers on HN would stop spreading FUD. The terrible point in the complete article is that basically, you need first to assume that the authorities will screw you and not help you.<p>For me, the \"todos in this case\" are just a cure for a dead man, because if you cannot trust the authorities anymore the basic assumptions of a working judiciary system are broken. Related: overcriminalization. Looks like this story relates to the same statute:<p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/16636027\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.economist.com/node/16636027</a> What's the situation in the UK on this whole Dont Talk to Cops thing? Does anyone know of any equivalent legal advice? Does this apply to Congresspersons? Does this apply to federal agents? In other words, if an officer says something false in a statement that is later read by another officer can they be charged? Does anyone know of a similar quality article for dealing with UK law enforcement? Or any other nation's law enforcement? Just <i>reading</i> this makes me nervous. I assume that most people who post here are smarter than the average citizen or at least more informed. The real \"spaghetti code\" problem here is that this obscure statute can easily be violated in advance of being told your rights. And you only get ready your rights a.k.a. mirandized when you're bordering on already in trouble with the law. Coupled with the fact that this is a federal statute it only applies to federal agents not city or state. And since you can lie to city or state officials up until you are under oath (which most people know) you might be inclined to believe he can do it to federal agent until it's too late. Which means their first encounter with a federal agent will be a crash course in the finer points of the law. One which they will unlikely be able to walk away from. I believe the spirit of v. Miranda is being violated the statute, I believe the beginning of any contacts with the law enforcement official should begin with the reading of your rights which should now include information on statute 18 sec 1001. Would be curious to see this sort of thing for other countries. It seems the police are held to lower standards than normal citizens when they should actually be held to higher standards. 5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a\npossession, 5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being\nprivy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles'\nfeet.<p>5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie\nto the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?\n5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,\nwas it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in\nthine heart?  thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.<p>5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost:\nand great fear came on all them that heard these things.<p>5:6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and\nburied him.<p>5:7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,\nnot knowing what was done, came in.<p>5:8 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for\nso much?

People I know who have run internet startups have had contact with federal agents on various occasions.<p>EDIT. This response is getting so many upvotes I'm going to clarify it a bit, particularly for people who may be reading this from other countries:<p>Yes, you can start and run a business in America without ever having direct interaction with the US Federal Government, other than mailing off your taxes.  It's not like every business one day gets a visit from the KGB and they tell you to do things a certain way (or else).<p>Nevertheless, if you are for example an ISP or provide messaging, as you grow big enough it's probably a matter of time before you'll end up getting a subscriber who's being investigated. You may have a former employee that goes on to apply for some sort of special security clearance and they follow up on his background (or you go out of your way to hire a talented hacker with a mysterious background). You may simply meet such agents due to ordinary shared interests, like say at a trade show or a conference. \nOf course, you could also meet them when they are also actually investigating something with the aim of prosecuting people.<p>I don't know which of these situations fall under the law described in the article, possibly all of them do. <i>&#62; if you are for example an ISP or provide messaging, as you grow big enough it's probably a matter of time before you'll end up getting a subscriber who's being investigated</i><p>That is not what Hacker News is for. If your company is that big, you should have counsel on retainer, and they should be advising you of the proper behavior in the face of potential federal investigation. Moreover, it's our job as American citizens to be aware of our legal exposure and to know the proper way to proceed. It's a shame that this is not taught in our high school Government courses.<p>It is not the role of Hacker News to educate us on these issues. There are other sites for that. You can tell by the quality of the comment thread that it's not something that appeals to \"our inner hacker.\" An article is not HN material simply by appealing to some (or even a majority) of the members here; it must satisfy other criteria, and this one does not. I came here to say the same thing, and I'm sorry that you're being downvoted. This article is not Hacker News material. It's useful information, yes, but that does not automatically mean it's Hacker Newsworthy.<p>Hacker News is not a funnel for good Reddit submissions. It has a different focus. This article is US-specific, transient, and not intellectually stimulating. It does not belong here, so I flagged it. I agree that downvotes shouldn't be used to indicate disagreement. The article satisfied my intellectual curiosity about a small aspect of a system that I find fascinating; that is why I submitted it. It's purpose was not to relay legal advice or make a political statement. However now that I see more than a few people think it's not Hacker News-worthy, I'll consider my future submissions more carefully. No need to apologize for submitting the article. It was certainly interesting, and I can understand why you submitted it. The problem, though, is that there are numerous such articles that we could read and discuss, enough to swamp more scientifically- or technically-relevant submissions. They are easy to digest and weigh in on without adding much.<p>I'm glad I read the article, so thanks for that. I was just surprised by how hard jsdalton got downvoted when he was right. It indicated to me a mismatch between what HN is \"supposed\" to be and what the commenters/voters here think it should be. Why not? The guidelines are basically anything that hackers find interesting. You yourself said it is interesting. It's \"interesting\" because it's of general interest to anybody (anybody in the U.S, that is), not because hackers would have a particular reason to find it interesting.<p>I thought it was off topic:<p>&#62; Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.<p>But that's just my opinion. Apologies for adding to the noise. I would downvote myself for this comment that I'm making, but:<p>I generally dislike this sort of meta-discussion on HN.  I believe the guidelines have something to say about this, as well: if you disagree with a posting, don't comment about it, just flag it and move on.  Adding a comment saying \"this doesn't belong on HN\" does not at all add to the discussion.  <i>That</i> is why I (and many others) will downvote you for your initial comment.  It's not because we disagree, it's because the comment is extraneous noise. This sort of meta-discussion sucks, but when the majority of the people responding to a comment are wrong[0] (as evidenced by jsdalton's numerous downvotes), then the necessity to educate the members outweighs the desire to avoid meta-discussion. The average commenter here has less than two years of membership[1]; many likely are not familiar with what HN is (was?) all about, and some of the longtime ones are likely getting sucked into interesting-but-vacuous discussion.<p>[0] I consider this to be undebatable. This is exactly the kind of submission pg wanted to avoid when he discouraged politics.
