This demo will present the Research Assistant (RA) tool developed to assist with six main types of research tasks defined as standardized instruction templates, instantiated with user input, applied finally as prompts to well-known--for their sophisticated natural language processing abilities--AI tools, such as ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) and Gemini (https://gemini.google.com/app). The six research tasks addressed by RA are: creating FAIR research comparisons, ideating research topics, drafting grant applications, writing scientific blogs, aiding preliminary peer reviews, and formulating enhanced literature search queries. RA's reliance on generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini means the same research task assistance can be offered in any scientific discipline. We demonstrate its versatility by sharing RA outputs in Computer Science, Virology, and Climate Science, where the output with the RA tool assistance mirrored that from a domain expert who performed the same research task.
