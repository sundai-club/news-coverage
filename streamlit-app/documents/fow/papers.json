There are many emerging AI risks for humanity,\nsuch as autonomous weapons, automation-spurred job loss, socio-economic\ninequality, bias caused by data and algorithms, privacy violations and\ndeepfakes. Social diversity, equity and inclusion are considered key success\nfactors of AI to mitigate risks, create values and drive social justice.\nSustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many\norganizations (government, corporate, not-for-profits, charities and NGOs) have\ndiversified strategies driving AI for business optimization and\nsocial-and-environmental justice. Partnerships and collaborations become\nimportant more than ever for equity and inclusion of diversified and\ndistributed people, data and capabilities.

Many consider generative AI as akin to previous\ntechnological advancements, using historical precedent to argue that fears of\nwidespread job displacement are unfounded, while others contend that generative\nAI`s unique capacity to undertake non-routine cognitive tasks sets it apart\nfrom other forms of automation capital and presents a threat to the quality and\navailability of work that underpin stable societies.

We posit the existence of an\nAI-capital-to-labour ratio threshold beyond which a self-reinforcing cycle of\nrecessionary pressures could be triggered, exacerbating social disparities,\nreducing social cohesion, heightening tensions, and requiring sustained\ngovernment intervention to maintain stability. To prevent this, the paper\nunderscores the urgent need for proactive policy responses, making\nrecommendations to reduce these risks through robust regulatory frameworks and\na new social contract characterised by progressive social and economic\npolicies.

Companies need to build up capabilities to implement new\ntechnologies, and automation may make some occupations obsolete. However,\nwhere, when, and how the change will happen remain to be determined. Robust\nempirical indicators of technological progress linked to occupations can help\nto illuminate this change. With this aim, we provide such an indicator based on\npatent data. Using natural language processing, we calculate patent exposure\nscores for more than 900 occupations, which represent the technological\nprogress related to them. To provide a lens on the impact of the 4IR, we\ndifferentiate between traditional and 4IR patent exposure. Our method differs\nfrom previous approaches in that it both accounts for the diversity of\ntask-level patent exposures within an occupation and reflects work activities\nmore accurately. We find that exposure to 4IR patents differs from traditional\npatent exposure. Manual tasks, and accordingly occupations such as construction\nand production, are exposed mainly to traditional (non-4IR) patents but have\nlow exposure to 4IR patents. The analysis suggests that 4IR technologies may\nhave a negative impact on job growth; this impact appears 10 to 20 years after\npatent filing. Further, we compared the 4IR exposure to other automation and AI\nexposure scores. Whereas many measures refer to theoretical automation\npotential, our patent-based indicator reflects actual technology diffusion. Our\nwork not only allows analyses of the impact of 4IR technologies as a whole, but\nalso provides exposure scores for more than 300 technology fields, such as AI\nand smart office technologies. Finally, the work provides a general mapping of\npatents to tasks and occupations, which enables future researchers to construct\nindividual exposure measures.",

Empowered by the Internet-of-Things\n(IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), EI aims to unlock peer-to-peer energy\ntrading and sharing among prosumers, who can adeptly switch roles between\nproviders and consumers in localized energy markets with rooftop photovoltaic\npanels, vehicle-to-everything technologies, packetized energy management, etc.\nThe integration of prosumers in EI, however, will encounter many challenges in\nmodelling, analyzing, and designing an efficient, economic, and social-optimal\nplatform for energy sharing, calling for advanced AI/IoT-based solutions to\nresource optimization, information exchange, and interaction protocols in the\ncontext of the share economy. In this study, we aim to introduce a recently\nemerged paradigm, Machina Economicus, to investigate the economic rationality\nin modelling, analysis, and optimization of AI/IoT-based EI prosumer behaviors.\nThe new paradigm, built upon the theory of machine learning and mechanism\ndesign, will offer new angles to investigate the selfishness of AI through a\ngame-theoretic perspective, revealing potential competition and collaborations\nresulting from the self-adaptive learning and decision-making capacity. This\nstudy will focus on how the introduction of AI will reshape prosumer behaviors\non the EI, and how this paradigm will reveal new research questions and\ndirections when AI meets the share economy. With an extensive case analysis in\nthe literature, we will also shed light on potential solutions for advancements\nof AI in future smart cities.",

This study investigates the implications of\ntwo cognitive biases, anthropomorphism and framing effect, on human-AI\ncollaboration within a hiring setting. Subjects were asked to select job\ncandidates with the help of an AI-powered recommendation tool. The tool was\nmanipulated to have either human-like or robot-like characteristics and\npresented its recommendations in either positive or negative frames. The\nresults revealed that the framing of AI's recommendations had no significant\ninfluence on subjects' decisions. In contrast, anthropomorphism significantly\naffected subjects' agreement with AI recommendations. Contrary to expectations,\nsubjects were less likely to agree with the AI if it had human-like\ncharacteristics. These findings demonstrate that cognitive biases can impact\nhuman-AI collaboration and highlight the need for tailored approaches to AI\nproduct design, rather than a single, universal solution.",

AI is often ascribed many\npositive impacts for different social domains such as medicine and the economy.\nOn the other side, there is also growing concern about its precarious impact on\nsociety and individuals. Several opinion polls frequently query the public fear\nof autonomous robots and artificial intelligence (FARAI), a phenomenon coming\nalso into scholarly focus. As potential threat perceptions arguably vary with\nregard to the reach and consequences of AI functionalities and the domain of\napplication, research still lacks necessary precision of a respective\nmeasurement that allows for wide-spread research applicability. We propose a\nfine-grained scale to measure threat perceptions of AI that accounts for four\nfunctional classes of AI systems and is applicable to various domains of AI\napplications. Using a standardized questionnaire in a survey study (N=891), we\nevaluate the scale over three distinct AI domains (loan origination, job\nrecruitment and medical treatment). The data support the dimensional structure\nof the proposed Threats of AI (TAI) scale as well as the internal consistency\nand factoral validity of the indicators. Implications of the results and the\nempirical application of the scale are discussed in detail. Recommendations for\nfurther empirical use of the TAI scale are provided.",

To fill this gap, this\narticle, taking a complex systems approach, develops a causal loop diagram\n(CLD) to map the causal feedback mechanisms of AI transformation in a typical\nHEI. Our model accounts for the forces that drive the AI transformation and the\nconsequences of the AI transformation on value creation in a typical HEI. The\narticle identifies and analyzes several reinforcing and balancing feedback\nloops, showing how, motivated by AI technology advances, the HEI invests in AI\nto improve student learning, research, and administration. The HEI must take\nmeasures to deal with academic integrity problems and adapt to changes in\navailable jobs due to AI, emphasizing AI-complementary skills for its students.\nHowever, HEIs face a competitive threat and several policy traps that may lead\nto decline. HEI leaders need to become systems thinkers to manage the\ncomplexity of the AI transformation and benefit from the AI feedback loops\nwhile avoiding the associated pitfalls. We also discuss long-term scenarios,\nthe notion of HEIs influencing the direction of AI, and directions for future\nresearch on AI transformation.",
