Upon deployment in closed, initially unknown environments,\nthe system aims to generate a comprehensive map and identify any present\n'victims' using AprilTags as stand-ins. We discuss our solution for search and\nrescue missions, while additionally exploring more advanced algorithms to\nimprove search and rescue functionalities. We introduce a Cubature Kalman\nFilter to help reduce the mean squared error [m] for AprilTag localization and\nan information-theoretic exploration algorithm to expedite exploration in\nunknown environments. Just like turtles, our system takes it slow and steady,\nbut when it's time to save the day, it moves at ninja-like speed!

These simulations take place in classical 2-D or 3-D Euclidean spaces.\nHowever, various biological forms actually grow in curved, non-Euclidean,\nspaces. This is for example the case of vein networks growing within curved\nleaf blades, of unicellular filaments, such as pollen tubes, growing on curved\nsurfaces to fertilize distant ovules, of teeth patterns growing on folded\nepithelia of animals, of diffusion of chemical or mechanical signals at the\nsurface of plant or animal tissues, etc. To model these forms growing in curved\nspaces, we thus extended the formalism of L-systems to non-Euclidean spaces. In\na first step we show that this extension can be carried out by integrating\nconcepts of differential geometry in the notion of turtle geometry. We then\nillustrate how this extension can be applied to model and program the\ndevelopment of both mathematical and biological forms on curved surfaces\nembedded in our Euclidean space. We provide various examples applied to plant\ndevelopment. We finally show that this approach can be extended to more\nabstract spaces, called abstract Riemannian spaces, that are not embedded into\nany higher space, while being intrinsically curved. We suggest that this\nabstract extension can be used to provide a new approach for effective modeling\nof tropism phenomena and illustrate this idea on a few conceptual examples.",

Decentralized Web\narchitectures, such as Solid, offer a promising solution by empowering users\nwith better control over their data in their personal `Pods'. However, a\nsignificant challenge remains: users must navigate numerous applications to\ndecide which application can be trusted with access to their data Pods. This\noften involves reading lengthy and complex Terms of Use agreements, a process\nthat users often find daunting or simply ignore. This compromises user autonomy\nand impedes detection of data misuse. We propose a novel formal description of\nData Terms of Use (DToU), along with a DToU reasoner. Users and applications\nspecify their own parts of the DToU policy with local knowledge, covering\npermissions, requirements, prohibitions and obligations. Automated reasoning\nverifies compliance, and also derives policies for output data. This\nconstitutes a ``perennial'' DToU language, where the policy authoring only\noccurs once, and we can conduct ongoing automated checks across users,\napplications and activity cycles. Our solution is built on Turtle, Notation 3\nand RDF Surfaces, for the language and the reasoning engine. It ensures\nseamless integration with other semantic tools for enhanced interoperability.\nWe have successfully integrated this language into the Solid framework, and\nconducted performance benchmark. We believe this work demonstrates a\npracticality of a perennial DToU language and the potential of a paradigm shift\nto how users interact with data and applications in a decentralized Web,\noffering both improved privacy and usability.",

Although their functions in\ncognitive activities remain until now poorly understood, these patterns are\nrelated to cortical activity modulation and contribute to cortical processing.\nIn this work, we construct a neuronal network layer based on the spatial\ndistribution of pyramidal neurons. Our main goal is to investigate how local\nconnectivity and coupling strength are associated with the emergence of spiral\nwaves. Therefore, we propose a trustworthy method capable of detecting\ndifferent wave patterns, based on local and global phase order parameters. As a\nresult, we find that the range of connection radius (R) plays a crucial role in\nthe appearance of spiral waves. For R < 20 {\\mu}m, only asynchronous activity\nis observed due to small number of connections. The coupling strength (gsyn )\ngreatly influences the pattern transitions for higher R, where spikes and\nbursts firing patterns can be observed in spiral and non-spiral waves.

However, a noticeable gap exists between in-situ measured\nOMF and that derived from remote sensing observations of the Sun. In this\nstudy, we investigate the OMF evolution and its connection to solar structures\nthroughout 2014, with special emphasis on the period from September to October,\nwhere a sudden and significant OMF increase was reported. By deriving the OMF\nevolution at 1au, modeling it at the source surface, and analyzing solar\nphotospheric data, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the observed\nphenomenon. First, we establish a strong correlation between the OMF increase\nand the solar magnetic field derived from a Potential Field Source Surface\n(PFSS) model ($cc_{\\mathrm{Pearson}}=0.94$). Moreover, we find a good\ncorrelation between the OMF and the open flux derived from solar coronal holes\n($cc_{\\mathrm{Pearson}}=0.88$), although the coronal holes only contain\n$14-32\\%$ of the Sun's total open flux. However, we note that while the OMF\nevolution correlates with coronal hole open flux, there is no correlation with\nthe coronal hole area evolution ($cc_{\\mathrm{Pearson}}=0.0$). The temporal\nincrease in OMF correlates with the vanishing remnant magnetic field at the\nsouthern pole, caused by poleward flux circulations from the decay of numerous\nactive regions months earlier. Additionally, our analysis suggests a potential\nlink between the OMF enhancement and the concurrent emergence of the largest\nactive region in solar cycle 24.

A dynamically\nevolving coronal hole coincides with the local restructuring of open to closed\nmagnetic field, which leads to changes in the interplanetary solar wind\nstructure. By investigating the dynamic evolution of a fast-tilting coronal\nhole, we strive to uncover clues about what processes may drive its\nmorphological changes, which are clearly visible in EUV filtergrams. Using\ncombined 193A and 195A EUV observations by AIA/SDO and EUVI/STEREO_A, in\nconjunction with line-of-sight magnetograms taken by HMI/SDO, we track and\nanalyze a coronal hole over 12 days to derive changes in morphology, area and\nmagnetic field. We complement this analysis by potential field source surface\nmodeling to compute the open field structure of the coronal hole. We find that\nthe coronal hole exhibits an apparent tilting motion over time that cannot\nsolely be explained by solar differential rotation. It tilts at a mean rate of\n~3.2{\\deg}/day that accelerates up to ~5.4{\\deg}/day. At the beginning of May,\nthe area of the coronal hole decreases by more than a factor of three over four\ndays (from ~13 * 10^9 km^2 to ~4 * 10^9 km^2), but its open flux remains\nconstant (~2 * 10^20 Mx). Further, the observed evolution is not reproduced by\nmodeling that assumes the coronal magnetic field to be potential. In this\nstudy, we present a solar coronal hole that tilts at a rate that has yet to be\nreported in literature. The rate exceeds the effect of the coronal hole being\nadvected by either photospheric or coronal differential rotation. Based on the\nanalysis we find it likely that this is due to morphological changes in the\ncoronal hole boundary caused by ongoing interchange reconnection and the\ninteraction with a newly emerging ephemeral region in its vicinity.",

Snapshot GNSS is a technique that only requires milliseconds of\nsatellite signals to infer the position of a receiver. This is ideal for\nlow-power applications such as animal tracking. However, there are few existing\nsnapshot systems, none of which is open source. To address this, we developed\nSnapperGPS, a fully open-source, low-cost, and low-power location tracking\nsystem designed for wildlife tracking. SnapperGPS comprises three parts, all of\nwhich are open-source: (i) a small, low-cost, and low-power receiver; (ii) a\nweb application to configure the receiver via USB; and (iii) a cloud-based\nplatform for processing recorded data. This paper presents the hardware side of\nthis project. The total component cost of the receiver is under $30, making it\nfeasible for field work with restricted budgets and low recovery rates. The\nreceiver records very short and low-resolution samples resulting in\nparticularly low power consumption, outperforming existing systems. It can run\nfor more than a year on a 40 mAh battery. We evaluated SnapperGPS in controlled\nstatic and dynamic tests in a semi-urban environment where it achieved median\nerrors of 12 m. Additionally, SnapperGPS has already been deployed for two\nwildlife tracking studies on sea turtles and sea birds.",

We focus on the challenge of overcoming the low signal-to-clutter\nratio (SCR) caused by reverberations. Assuming that, due to low SCR, target\nreflections within the point cloud are received in groups, our detector\nsearches for patterns through clustering to identify possible 'blobs' in the\npoint cloud of reflections, and to classify them as either clutter or a target.\nOur unsupervised clustering is based on geometrical and spectral constraints\nover the blob's member relations. In turn, the classification of identified\nblobs as either a target or clutter is based on features extracted from the\nreflection pattern. To this end, assuming reflections from a sea turtle are\nstable but include spectral diversity due to distortions within the turtles\nbody, we quantify the stability of the blob's members and their spectral\nentropy. We test our detector in both modeled simulations, and at sea, for the\ndetection of sea turtles released after rehabilitation.

The\nanimals are marked with acoustic devices (tags) that periodically emit signals\nencoding the device's ID along with sensor data such as depth, temperature, or\nthe dominant acceleration axis - data that is collected by a network of\ndeployed receivers. In this work, we aim to optimize the locations of receivers\nfor best tracking of acoustically tagged marine megafauna. The outcomes of such\ntracking allows the evaluation of the animals' motion patterns, their hours of\nactivity, and their social interactions. In particular, we focus on how to\ndetermine the receivers' deployment positions to maximize the coverage area in\nwhich the tagged animals can be tracked. For example, an overly-condensed\ndeployment may not allow accurate tracking, whereas a sparse one, may lead to a\nsmall coverage area due to too few detections. We formalize the question of\nwhere to best deploy the receivers as a non-convex constraint optimization\nproblem that takes into account the local environment and the specifications of\nthe tags, and offer a sub-optimal, low-complexity solution that can be applied\nto large testbeds. Numerical investigation for three stimulated sea\nenvironments shows that our proposed method is able to increase the\nlocalization coverage area by 30%, and results from a test case experiment\ndemonstrate similar performance in a real sea environment.

Two driving factors for early time evolution are the distribution\nof nickel in the ejecta and the presence of flux excesses of various causes. We\nperform an analysis of the largest young SN Ia sample to date. We compare 115\nSN Ia light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility to the turtls model grid\ncontaining light curves of Chandrasekhar-mass explosions with a range of nickel\nmasses, nickel distributions and explosion energies. We find that the majority\nof our observed light curves are well reproduced by Chandrasekhar-mass\nexplosion models with a preference for highly extended nickel distributions. We\nidentify six SNe Ia with an early-time flux excess in our g- and r-band data\n(four `blue' and two `red' flux excesses). We find an intrinsic rate of 18+/-11\nper cent of early flux excesses in SNe Ia at z < 0.07, based on three detected\nflux excesses out of 30 (10 per cent) observed SNe Ia with a simulated\nefficiency of 57 per cent. This is comparable to rates of flux excesses in the\nliterature but also accounts for detection efficiencies. Two of these events\nare mostly consistent with CSM interaction, while the other four have longer\nlifetimes in agreement with companion interaction and nickel-clump models.

        "text": "A standing challenge in undergraduate Computer Science curricula is the\nteaching and learning of computer programming. Through this paper which is an\nessay about programming, we aim to contribute to the plethora of existing\npedagogies, approaches and philosophies, by discussing a specific feature of\nour approach in teaching principled programming to undergraduate students, in\ntheir first semester of studies, namely the utilization of pictures, both\ntext-based and raster-based graphics. Although the given course has evolved\nsubstantially over the thirty years of its delivery regarding the programming\nlanguages (Miranda, C, C++, Java) and paradigms (functional, imperative,\nobject-oriented, combination of procedural and object-oriented) used, the\ndiscussed visual feature has been maintained and steadily strengthened.\n  We list abstraction, problem decomposition and synthesis, information hiding,\nreusability, modularity and extensibility as key principles of problem solving\nand algorithmic thinking. These principles are closely aligned with the\nadvocated computational thinking techniques of problem decomposition, pattern\nrecognition, pattern generalization and algorithm design. We aim for our\nstudents to familiarize themselves with all the above principles through\npractical problem solving. Our ongoing inquiry has been whether the problem\ndomain of pictures is contributing valuably towards this aim. Moreover, an\nadded-value is that students get a glimpse of computational complexity in a\nvisual, empirical way.\n  The presented work is not related to visual programming, since the students\nwrite their programs textually and not graphically; it's the output of their\nprograms which is in visual form. Our approach though is loosely related to the\nclassical paradigm of turtle graphics. However, our focus is Computer Science\nmajors, who should be able to design and build turtles and other objects and\nnot just use them. Indeed, the programming principles course helps them to do\nboth and also to appreciate the multitude of algorithmic ways for producing the\nsame visual output. Currently the given programming principles are approached\nboth from a procedural, process-based and an object-oriented, concept-based\nperspective and the course uses the Java language. Through the presented\nexample problems, we aim to show the appropriateness of the visual domain of\npictures for supporting the learning of principled programming. The problem\ndomain of pictures is abundantly rich with potential examples to draw from.\nMoreover, as reported in the literature, female students may show higher\ninterest towards visual problem domains in programming classes, in relation to\nother problem domains. We plan to investigate this conjecture in the context of\nour broader aim to encourage more females to follow university studies in\ncomputer science; in this paper only a cursory finding is presented, that bears\nsome relation to what is reported in the literature.",

        "text": "In response to ESA Voyage 2050 announcement of opportunity, we propose an\nambitious L-class mission to explore one of the most exciting bodies in the\nSolar System, Saturn largest moon Titan. Titan, a \"world with two oceans\", is\nan organic-rich body with interior-surface-atmosphere interactions that are\ncomparable in complexity to the Earth. Titan is also one of the few places in\nthe Solar System with habitability potential. Titan remarkable nature was only\npartly revealed by the Cassini-Huygens mission and still holds mysteries\nrequiring a complete exploration using a variety of vehicles and instruments.\nThe proposed mission concept POSEIDON (Titan POlar Scout/orbitEr and In situ\nlake lander DrONe explorer) would perform joint orbital and in situ\ninvestigations of Titan. It is designed to build on and exceed the scope and\nscientific/technological accomplishments of Cassini-Huygens, exploring Titan in\nways that were not previously possible, in particular through full close-up and\nin situ coverage over long periods of time. In the proposed mission\narchitecture, POSEIDON consists of two major elements: a spacecraft with a\nlarge set of instruments that would orbit Titan, preferably in a\nlow-eccentricity polar orbit, and a suite of in situ investigation components,\ni.e. a lake lander, a \"heavy\" drone (possibly amphibious) and/or a fleet of\nmini-drones, dedicated to the exploration of the polar regions. The ideal\narrival time at Titan would be slightly before the next northern Spring equinox\n(2039), as equinoxes are the most active periods to monitor still largely\nunknown atmospheric and surface seasonal changes. The exploration of Titan\nnorthern latitudes with an orbiter and in situ element(s) would be highly\ncomplementary with the upcoming NASA New Frontiers Dragonfly mission that will\nprovide in situ exploration of Titan equatorial regions in the mid-2030s.",

        "text": "The MUon Scattering Experiment, MUSE, at the Paul Scherrer Institute,\nSwitzerland, investigates the proton charge radius puzzle, lepton universality,\nand two-photon exchange, via simultaneous measurements of elastic muon-proton\nand electron-proton scattering. The experiment uses the PiM1 secondary beam\nchannel, which was designed for high precision pion scattering measurements. We\nreview the properties of the beam line established for pions. We discuss the\nproduction processes that generate the electron and muon beams, and the\nsimulations of these processes. Simulations of the $\\pi$/$\\mu$/$e$ beams\nthrough the channel using TURTLE and G4beamline are compared. The G4beamline\nsimulation is then compared to several experimental measurements of the\nchannel, including the momentum dispersion at the IFP and target, the shape of\nthe beam spot at the target, and timing measurements that allow the beam\nmomenta to be determined. We conclude that the PiM1 channel can be used for\nhigh precision $\\pi$, $\\mu$, and $e$ scattering.",
