        "text": "This movie just came out on HBO Max yesterday and wow. Just wow. It's all about a young woman suffering from OCD and how that affects her daily life, even when she really doesn't want it to. I have a really strange relationship with this property. It's based off of a book of the same name, written by John Green, a famous author with OCD. When I first read it, I was about four months away from seeing a psychiatrist for the first time. But when I was reading it in the moment, I didn't know that. I didn't know I had OCD. So I actually didn't really like the book at first, mainly just because of how much I related to the main character--and getting frustrated by her compulsions. I totally remember thinking like, \"Well, I have thought spirals like that all the time, but you don't see me freaking out about it like that.\" Fast forward to my visit with the psychiatrist and suddenly I'm diagnosed with OCD and wait--you mean to tell me that the thought spiral thing--not everyone thinks like that?!\n\nWell it's been a long time since then, and I haven't ever tried to read the book again. But the movie adaptation just came out and it was a totally different experience this time around. I do not tend to be an emotional watcher, but I was broken. Cried and cried. Because this movie, this story--the main character's inner narration is so true to the OCD experience. And it reminded me of how much I struggled day to day before I was on medication. Just replace her inner monologue obsession with my obsession and we sound identical. And the movie is such an amazing representation of OCD. I can't think of any other fictional character with OCD who wasnt just a \"neat freak,\" or OCD wasnt their whole personality.\n\nAnyway, go check it out if you can. It's pretty amazing.\n Comment: Shout out to all the nerdfighters lurking r/OCD. John Green has been an amazing public representative of living with OCD.\n Comment: I love the smell of accurate OCD representation in the morning! I loved the book and movie so much- to have something I can watch now when I feel alone is a wonderful feeling- it’s one I’m not all that used to. John, the director, Hannah, Cree, Isabel, Felix, Maliq, etc. did a beyond fantastic, phenomenal job. This movie is a new era for accurate OCD and mental illness representation! I can only say thank you to John and the cast of TATWD for putting their all into this project!\n Comment: I watched the trailer and got major teen movie vibes... I loved the book though. I’ll have to give the movie a try and go in with an open mind \n\nThe book absolutely represented the feeling and consequences of OCD very well, despite having wildly different themes than I do. Highly recommend the book to anyone who hasn’t read it. I read it randomly after seeing it in the waiting room at my therapists office\n Comment: I sobbed. Two minutes in when she was talking about being inconsistent with her meds, I cried during the book too but I REALLY cried at the movie. \n Comment: Honestly it's one of my fave John Green books. I haven't been able to see the movie yet, but with reviews like these, I might just have to get Crave for a month (Canadian's access to HBO/Max)\n Comment: I read the book back in high school I had no idea they were making a movie !!\n Comment: Question about the movie and not trying to discredit germs ocd but is it all about germs and cleaning or also the more bad stuff like harm ocd etc?\n Comment: I haven’t seen the movie but thought the book was by far the best representation of OCD I’ve ever read. I wish they called it OCD in the book though. If I remember correctly they just called it “anxiety”.\n Comment: I had a similar experience with the book. I adore John and Hank and their transparency with mental health. I just got diagnosed with OCD and am excited to watch the film adaptation. I want to reread the book too.\n Comment: Literally cried through half the movie. It was such an accurate portrayal of what OCD is really like. Never seen that in media until now.\n Comment: i watched the movie for the first time the other day and immediately bought the book digitally and then paperback the next day. i also have autism and just get super interested in things lol movies/shows are my special interest and i loved reading growing up and have been trying to get back into it and this book is definitely whats bringing me back into reading. that story is so beautiful. its genuinely one of the most realistic representations for ocd that ive ever personally seen. the concept behind the story is  also just beautiful i loved every bit of it and i cant wait to keep reading😭\n Comment: The movie itself was good not great but good but the spiral scenes oh my god.\nI was sobbing during the first spiral scene because of how relatable it was. I also cried during every other spiral.\nI have contamination OCD like Aza and didn’t know for years until this year and that movie really helped me realize how much OCD has actually affected my life and my behaviors.\n Comment: I’m gonna watch it soon\n Comment: May i ask what medication you are on?\n Comment: Nerdfighters?\n Comment: It does have teen movie vibes so be warned but, it’s worth the watch. It’s pretty spot on to the book. \n Comment: She has health OCD it’s more about her existential OCD and her not feeling like she is real but also that she will die if she doesn’t do a specific task (cleaning a cut she keeps opening) \n Comment: I almost think that a part of me was in denial when I read the book. Cuz those thoughts were so obviously mine, but it could NEVER be me. You know?\n Comment: Looking for Alaska is great by him too! I have a fixation on books as well and his stuff is very unique. Looking for Alaska has an equally emotionally compelling show on Hulu\n Comment: I'm on 25 mg Sertraline and 50 mg Welbutrin. I'll testify that this combo has saved my life.\n Comment: It's just what he calls his fans\n Comment: I get that 💯 I felt a bit disconnected when I read it too. Normally I fall right into a character’s head but that felt too close and I was likely in denial about how much I related to it.\n Comment: Ah, ok",

        "text": "I haven't read the book, but this movie really hit me hard. I LOVE LOVE LOVED the imagery, and Isabela Merced's performance blew me away. I've been a fan of hers since \"Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life.\" She portrayed Aza so convincingly. As someone who deals with similar mental issues, some scenes felt incredibly real to me. It's rare to see that level of authenticity in a teen movie, and I'm grateful they portrayed it. This film will stick with me for a while. \n Comment: As someone with OCD, her intrusive thoughts and existential feelings felt so relatable I almost cried at some points. The main actress is also very talented! The only thing I didn’t like was the ending. I didn’t read the book, but I have a feeling it was captured better in words.\n Comment: It’s very well done and she’s amazing. \n\nIt felt a little rushed and oddly paced to me, but part of that is expectations from the book, which is kind of a slow burn in a lot of ways.\n Comment: I wish this had a theatrical release… :’(\n Comment: I cried so bad.\n Comment: I loved the first half, the buddy comedy chemistry was great and the zany friend killed it (I'll try to avoid comparisons to Superbad). I was rocking along with the beginning and I was impressed the way I was when I started Snack Shack a couple weeks back.  I know it feels silly to criticize this aspect of a Young Adult adaptation but the movie went all the way down to the gutter when they brought in the romance and YA-ization of the movie.  \nIt's still a great depiction of OCD and the leads absolutely crushed it. In terms of recent releases, I prefer 'Pure O' for its interpretation of what OCD can look like on screen.\n Comment: Is the movie an accurate depiction of the book? \n Comment: I really really liked it\n Comment: I loved it a lot too. It’s one of those movies that really connect with me with having OCD and such so I know how the character feels.\n Comment: Personally, I thought the acting wasn't that amazing. But that's just my opinion, man. Overall, an easy watch on a Sunday afternoon to pass the time by.\n Comment: Isabela Merced proved herself as an extremely good actress. That scene in the car, and *that* scene in the hosptial? FUCK.\n\nTurtles All the Way Down wasn't a perfect book by a long shot, with Green's typical clichéd teen romance (with a good \"twist\" ending), eyeroll-inducing philosophical monologues, and the absolutely absurd \"mystery\", but this is basically a pitch perfect adaptation (don't get me wrong, I like the book; its portrayal of anxiety and OCD is amazing). This is the rare adaptation where everything lived up to my imagination. The direction is snappy, the writing is marginally improved from the book, the lead performance is stellar. My only complaint is that compared to the book, Daisy seemed to lose a little focus and Davis gained a little. But overall, great adaption of a decent book.\n\n”Objectively\", 6.5/10, mostly because while its well made and acted, John Green's writing underlying it all just brings it down.\n\nPersonally, 8/10 for Merced's portrayal. I cried.\n Comment: Really disliked this movie. The acting was good but the main character, although I understand there are people that suffer from OCD, was extremely hard to like to the point I just wanted it to end.\n Comment: The scene where Aza >!eats all that hand sanitizer!< hit me hard. I don't have OCD, but I do have depression, and I have had negative thought spirals where I can't help hurting myself. I spent the rest of the movie sobbing, and I'm still a bit weepy. I loved this movie; it's fantastic. Sure, the teen rom-com bits are cliché, but this movie has so much heart.\n Comment: Where is it available to view?\n Comment: The mustard comparison from Daisy to Aza struck a nerve. Thoughts?\n Comment: I loved the movie so much. I have never felt so seen with this type of ocd, and obsessing over illnesses and bacteria everywhere. \n Comment: Haven’t sobbed at a movie in quite a while, this got me good\n Comment: Hard recommend on a read if you're into the movie!\n Comment: Watching it right now. I read the book when it first came out and by god this movie is making me remember all the tiny little things about it. Im literelly teared up at the scenes after the accident.\n Comment: I thought it was a series \n Comment: Thought it was decent at best.  Incredibly overrated on rotten tomatoes.  Its basically another cliche sick girl love story but just with a controllable via medication disorder.  So theres no stakes.   Unless you believe having contamination OCD is some kind of death sentence like it was portrayed.   its not.  Not close.\n Comment: Kind of? The author has admitted that he broke genre conventions with the end of the novel because he switched perspective from young Aza to grown Aza describing the life she would go on to have. But he also had so much trouble coming up with an ending that he hasn’t written a fiction book since.\n Comment: Same\n Comment: Superbad isn’t the comparison, BookSmart is certainly a good comparison for the friend. I thought she was a great character, probably my favorite\n Comment: Not really. They left out a bunch of stuff and added some major scenes that weren’t in the book. The overall theme is pretty much the same but I feel like a lot of important info was missed.\n Comment: I agree with everything except the John Green soft hate...\nI wanna upvote you ofc and it's a smart analysis but I owe sorta my life to his books so won't haha. \n\nI am glad u enjoyed the movie tho. In nerdfighteria..him and his brother's community we are loving the love. It means a lot.\n Comment: HBOMAX\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: John Green said that he is basically retired from writing fiction novels. He will focus on non-fiction and there might be short fiction stories posted occasionally.\n Comment: Ya lol he says he can’t write a plot for shit, I think in those exact words haha\n Comment: Like what? I know they cut some stuff out but it's been a whole since I read the book. Idk how they are abt spoilers here but if that'd be a problem then dm me\n Comment: What was added?\n Comment: ty!\n Comment: They left out a lot of Davis’ story. In the movie, it didn’t even feel like he was a real character. They added the scene where they fly to Chicago and visit campus. The stuff with the mom building an apartment for her never happened. The mom really didn’t even say Aza wouldn’t be able to handle college in a different state. The dad’s disappearance is slightly different in the book. And then there were little things like how Davis gave Aza the money and conversations that were out of place. Those weren’t a big deal though.\n Comment: 6 minutes in and I spotted a whole bunch of mistakes, granted I just re-read the book yesterday without knowing there was a movie so I remember the finer details that wouldn't have mattered otherwise.\n Comment: The whole plane ride to Chicago and going to campus isn’t in the book at all. Also, the dad’s disappearance is not the same in the book.\n Comment: Yeah I noticed a few of those, but didn't think any of them were major  \nIn hindsight though, Davis really didn't get any character development, his brother was basically useless to the plot, and Aza's relationship with her dad was never really explained other than being sad she wrecked his old car.  \nAlso I'm just gonna say, as a film-nerd, the editing around the car crash was really weird and disorientating\n Comment: They’re not really “mistakes” (especially considering the author and his long time professional collaborator are both producers) but just differences.\n Comment: Same here. I finished rereading the book right before watching the movie so I noticed the really small things that weren’t a big deal. But adding the Chicago scene and basically pushing Davis to the side bothered me.\n Comment: I totally agree. For the most part, a lot of the little things didn’t make a difference. But the scene where Aza and Daisy are in the tunnels was changed in the movie and I didn’t love that. In the book, Aza isn’t afraid of the tunnels. She actually gives this whole speech to Daisy about how having the light gives her control while being completely in the dark is a lot like what her brain is like all the time. I thought it was a really important discussion that was missed in the movie. \nAnd yeah, Davis and Noah getting basically nothing in the movie really sucked. And I agree that the crash scene was a little disorienting.\n Comment: Ya he was super involved in the making of the movie\n Comment: Right!! I knew the tunnels got cut down and something happened in them in the book. I knew they had a moment together. In the movie it was like \"And then they were in the tunnels, and then they were no longer in the tunnels and solved the riddle from the very beginning and now the movie is done.\"  \nI still think it's a good adaptation of the book, but I think it needed another 20-30min to the runtime",

        "title": "Thoughts on “turtles all the way down”?",
        "text": "Heyy everyone :)\n\nHave you guys seen the movie “turtles all the way down”? If not, it tells a story about a girl with anxiety and OCD disorders and how she navigates life with it, It’s pretty good! \n\nFor those who have seen it:\nDid you like it? I personally felt like OCD was somewhat accurately represented for ONCE and it made me so happy to finally something I’ve been struggling with for years and years on screen.\nMainly I LOVED how the torturous inner monologue was done, with the demand of answers, constant questions, constant “do it OR” constant “but WHAT IF?” It’s all so very familiar and definitely made me feel like a “normal” person for once. Also I must mention the “you are the demon” quote… I felt like one during my bad days…\n\nI also enjoy the ending and how they did not make it seem like it will ever get easier or that we will be “cured”, I like that they understood how some days will always be worse then others with OCD and well…with LIFE in general…\n\nAlso, how relationships suffer because of OCD. I also became a very bad friend after my diagnosis,  I also think that I can never be in a solid relationship, I also think that I can’t be a mother because of my diagnosis…so it all truly hit home.\n\nOne thing I personally find slightly inaccurate (at least from my experience) is that she has these few minute “episodes” of thought spiral when for me thoughts are ALWAYS present, almost 24/7, but I also understand how narratively speaking they could not really show that.\n\nI liked the turtle theory and “maybe you are infinite” quote, as someone whose very recent theme is existencial ocd, it brought me some peace of mind.\nAnyway, enough rambling🤣\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did you enjoy the movie? \n Comment: I read the book, but haven't seen the movie yet. The book I thought was the best representation of OCD I've ever seen, and it was very emotional for me to read.\n Comment: the author has ocd\n Comment: >!​!<Long post incoming! The TL;DR is: I enjoyed the OCD rep in the film, much like I did with the book. Not a fan of the billionaire plot. I could leave that mystery and be just as okay with this story. Overall, I really enjoyed \"Turtles All the Way Down\", flaws and all. I'm coming out with a full review of \"Turtles All the Way Down\" on YouTube (currently writing it, hoping to have it out for either my mid-month vid or beginning of next month!) that has more details, and more spoilers than even the long version has.\n\nLONG VERSION, SPOILERS AHEAD: >!​!<\n\n>!I purchased the book quite quickly when it came out, and have loved its representation of OCD ever since. I feel the movie is quite the same. As John Green (the author) has said in interviews, Ava's experience was just intended to be Ava's. There is no \"everyone's experience\" with OCD. However, it seems he did want it to be more representative of OCD in general. It isn't \"just somebody who washes their hands 4 times a day\" or keeps organized.!<\n\n>!Personally, I do have those minute episodes of thought, especially when my OCD comes back after being otherwise under control. For me, it starts with those minute episodes, and then it spirals from there. Sometimes it's something that I can brush off by focusing on the present, as Ava does within the film a few times. However there are definitely other times when OCD is all-encompassing and you can't focus on anything other than this obsessional fear. !<\n\n>!I love the way that the OCD episodes are book-ended by that \"static\" of anxiety. It's something that I don't think I've ever had words to express, that buzzing anxiety feeling surrounding an episode of OCD. I was really surprised and impressed with the way that the film portrayed this, along with how they didn't lose how internal the experience of OCD can be, despite physical compulsions. Compulsions may be all that people see, but the internal part of OCD is also a huge part of this illness.!<\n\n>!I loved the way that OCD is represented through different *kinds* of thoughts. It's not all just \"What if A happens? To make sure A doesn't happen, you need to do B.\" Instead, it can look like a mental back-and-forth conversation between you and OCD Brain, or as a \"shit's gonna go down, you know how to fix it, so just Do The Thing to Prevent the Shit-Storm.\"!<\n\n>!While I've never had a compulsion like Aza's \"eating soap\" compulsion, I've been able to relate to the \"weird compulsions\" or the \"these don't make sense but I HAVE to do it because, to OCD, it DOES make sense\" compulsions.!<\n\n>!​It felt like a b-plot that was forced to have too much weight put on it.!<\n\n>!I remember reading the book for the first time and feeling very unsatisfied with the mystery plot because of this. It really did feel like a shoved in b-plot, like \"oh shit, I need something Not OCD-related in this book.\" I feel that they did improve on that in the movie, and it seems more present to me in the film than I recall it ever did in the book. (I will admit that I am about to start a re-read of the book again, so there is a solid chance that this \"b-plot frustration\" is just based on old vibes that don't stand up to a re-read.​!<\n Comment: In the first 10 minutes it was very relatable and even had the therapist say something my mother had said for years. I haven’t finished because I was triggered about halfway through. Plan to finish it though.\n Comment: im reading the book rn and im almost done w it! v excited to watch the movie. i love john green and he has ocd, so i find that the book is really well-written in how it feels. its so nice to get proper mainstream rep of it from someone who struggles with it themselves.\n Comment: I cried for like the first 10 mins. I don't have contamination as a theme but to see what I go through represented visually was such a surreal experience. Especially seeing mental compulsions represented. Maybe for once people will have a glimpse into our worlds and what we go through. I'm so thankful this movie exists (literally watching it as I type haha)\n Comment: I had never heard about that movie but i will sure watch it. Thanks for the post!\n Comment: Absolutely loved it, best potratal of ocd I’ve ever seen and was refreshing to finally have my partner see what it’s like. Spoilers below!!!\n\nTwo small details I love is after she talked to the professor, and came to her realization, it wasn’t magically cured. She had a wave of inspiration, and it came fiercely. The second is even when saying goodbyes at the end, aza didn’t kiss him. My gf hated this but I was the opposite, I relate heavily because OCD doesn’t take breaks for sentimental moments. That last kiss is a testament to all the things we miss out on because even during big moments, it’s still there.\n Comment: i'm not sure bc again its contamination ocd and i dont have that type. i'm not sure i i'll relate. could you lmk\n Comment: I'm actually planning on watching it tonight!  I definitely related to the OCD stuff in the trailer so I'm looking forward to seeing it (hopefully it isn't too triggering lol)\n Comment: This is my favorite book. I had no idea that the movie came out. I read this book so many times, especially during that dark time. The time in between when I confessed that I’d been feeling this way and the time that I actually got diagnosed. It was my comfort book. It made me feel so much less alone. \n Comment: I read the book a year ago, right after getting diagnosed. I really enjoyed it, it made me emotional at some points, like it put into words the way I feel and how my brain works if it makes sense. You can tell the author (John Green) knows what he's talking about because he has OCD too.\n Comment: I just watched the movie today. I thought it was a good movie overall, but as far as relatability for me, I have very mixed feelings. She talks about thought spirals a lot. Based on what I've read online, this seems to be a common experience among OCD sufferers, but it doesn't relate to my OCD at all. Her thoughts are so fast, and there's so many of them, it's like a record player playing music at five times the speed. But my OCD experience is more like a record player with a scratched up record. I don't get racing thoughts, I get sticky thoughts. It's like my mind is constantly trying to organize itself and reorganize itself and keep track of everything. I don't even have an internal monologue, or at least I don't think I do. My mind is just a fog. I think my OCD is a lot more compulsion based than the main character of this movie, and usually when I do compulsions there's not really much of a thought process before doing them, I just do them automatically. I know there's a reason behind why I do them, but those thoughts are usually a lot more subconscious than loud, and if someone asks me why I was doing a specific compulsion, I would have to think about it for a bit before coming up with an answer. I don't get racing thoughts, but I will get stuck on a step and reassure myself over and over and over again that I didn't screw something up like a broken record until I'm ready to move onto the next thing. And the feeling to have to narrate my life just to stay focused and make sure I don't do something I'm not supposed to subconciously. Another analogy that might also work for me I think is also Weekend at Bernies with me being the dead guy and my ocd being the guys trying to make the dead guy move and seem alive. But thought spirals and internal monolgoues? Not really a part of my ocd experience. Honestly, the discussion of thought spirals and internal monologues sometimes makes me wonder if I even have ocd since they are not a part of my ocd experience (even though I know that I do have ocd because no non-ocd person would spend as much time on compulsions as I have). \n\n\nI did like how the movie portrayed how ocd can affect sexuality, which is something I felt like I could relate to. I've kissed a guy before, but not a \"real kiss\" with saliva swapping (more like a quick peck on the lips), and french kissing does gross me out a little. I don't think I would react as strongly as the main character of the movie did if somebody french kissed me, but I would feel at least some disgust/discomfort for a bit. I would feel more anxiety if he licked my arm/hand. I'm more likely to get aggigated than breakdown, but perhaps that could be because I never challenged myself that much or did erp more gradually where i didn't have to feel that anxious. I think I could french kiss and even lose my virginity without having a complete breakdown, but I think it would take a lot practice for me to enjoy it or even be comfortable with it. I don't know if ocd explains all of my asexuality, but I do think it's a huge factor and hope that some day with a patient boyfriend and sex erp I can become more heterosexual. Because it's like I'm missing a sixth sense; I want to feel passionate feelings like other people do, but I just don't. And like the main character of the movie, it's hard to enjoy french kissing when saliva swapping grosses you out. \n\n\nAlso, even though the C part of OCD is bigger than O part for me, I do have mental compulsions that I try to do while trying to watch tv/movie or while someone's talking to me occassionally, so I could relate to the main character when her obsessional thoughts made it hard for her to pay attention to people's conversations a little bit.\n\n\nThere were a few similarities, but I overall had a hard time relating to the main character. She was a thought spiral and I'm just a broken record player. She had a loud internal monologue whereas my mind is just a fog constantly trying to reorganize itself and check to make sure I'm doing stuff right. I'm sure there are plenty of ocd people that find her experience very relatable, but it's just very hard to make a ocd character that is relatable to every person with ocd because the ocd experience is so different with every individual. \n\n\nIt was nice to see an OCD character in movie/TV though. The only other OCD character I've ever seen was Rue in Euphoria, but I found her even more unrelatable than Asa in this movie because my ocd ironically discourages me from drinking and doing drugs because I feel like I have to be in control of my thoughts and actions, and drinking and drugs for me would probably be more of an exposure than an escape for me. Ironically, my OCD related a lot more to Cassie in Euphoria because of how long she spent getting ready for the day (although she did more beauty rituals whereas mine is more personal hygiene based, but both cost a lot of time), but a lot of ppl online seem to suspect she has borderline personality disorder rather than ocd. \n Comment: That’s so funny I have 10 minutes left of the movie when this notification popped up on my phone lolol. I looked it up and John Green had ocd himself so it makes sense that it’s done so well. It felt a little triggering at times but I’m very very early in my ocd journey so I kind of expected to be triggered when I turned it on, definitely helped me understand myself a little bit better\n Comment: i loved the book and found the movie kinda triggering :/\n Comment: I definitely want to read the book as well, I hope I get my hands on it soon!\n Comment: im almost done with the book and i totally agree!!!\n Comment: Great outlook! I also didn’t enjoy the whole “disappearance plot” and felt like it was kinda forced… it’s interesting to know that people have those “episodes” and then the spiral begins because for me it was always gradual and sorth of a “build-up” of obsessions… I also agree that you can never make a movie where every person with OCD will feel equally seen & heard because there are so many subtypes of OCD and we are just genuinely such different people but they definitely did a pretty good job at giving a general overview of this condition!\n Comment: I completely understand…I’ve never had the OCD subtype the main character has so for me it was not triggering but what was triggering is the inner monologue she has with herself and her thoughts. It was so relatable but reminded me of very dark times. Please don’t pressure yourself, finish it whenever you feel like you are ready!❤️\n Comment: Yes it was just GREAT to see a somewhat accurate representation of OCD! I am so thankful for john green as well\n Comment: Exactly…that’s exactly how I felt\n Comment: You are welcome I hope you enjoy it!!❤️\n Comment: i don’t really have contamination ocd but i related heavily. i only read the book, but she talks a lot about the “thought spirals” she gets trapped in. john green did an excellent job\n Comment: I also don’t have contamination OCD and never did but it was still very relatable! I assure you her thought process will still most likely align with yours!\n Comment: thats fair i think!! i still found it really well-described even though i dont have contamination ocd.\n Comment: Yes just give it a shot, if you feel overwhelmed you can always try watching it another time, I took little breaks as well during some intense moments. Let us know whether you’ll like it or not :)\n Comment: https://archive.org/details/turtlesallwaydow0000gree/page/1/mode/1up\n\n a free online copy :)\nI haven't read it yet but will be soon\n Comment: Libraries are great! My library gives me access to ebooks through Hoopla or Libby. Maybe yours has something similar?\n Comment: Omg thank you SO SO SO much!!!❤️❤️❤️\n Comment: I will definitely check! Thank you so much:)",

        "text": "This isn’t a sponsored post, I swear. I just love this movie.\n\nBut movies very rarely make me tear up (not even The Fault in Our Stars), and this one did. My subtype isn’t the same as Aza’s but *I felt seen*. The “thought spirals” are near spot on. The pain, the shame, the need to escape. The happier childhood that devolved into one with thought spirals and anxiety. The compulsions.\n\nJohn Green, who has OCD himself, made sure to get it right. He cared! \n\nERP is even mentioned. \n\nOCD is a large part of the plot, but it isn’t the whole plot. There’s more to Aza than JUST her OCD. \n\nAza goes on to have a full life though she still struggles with OCD. The story doesn’t have an utterly tragic ending where OCD swallows her and ruins her and everything around her. \n\nThere’s hope, even if it isn’t what we think it’s going to look like.  \n\nIt’s a narrative about us with that ever poetic John Green flair.\n\nIf you are in the right headspace (it gets pretty rough and triggeing in some spots), I could not recommend this movie more\n\n\n\n\n Comment: I personally didn’t like the movie or the book that much, but I do find the parts focused on her thought spirals and OCD to be relatable! I’m glad it had such a nice impact on you\n Comment: > ever poetic John Green flair\n\nWell that makes me think I might be too old to enjoy it lol\n Comment: I loved it so much! I’m on my fourth watch currently and my second read of the book. I enjoy it because I don’t have really any friends with OCD who get it and this movie and book makes me feel a part of it 💖 I think with all the wrong depictions of it in movies, John has made history and in the OCD community for getting this right. You know, although not everyone has contamination OCD, he got the emotions, isolation, loneliness, etc right!\n Comment: That guy playing the gym teacher was just awful\n Comment: My therapist recommended me this movie and said that I could relate to the themes and characters in the movie, but she didn't explain much more about it. Thank you, I will check it out!\n Comment: It’s amazing, watched it last night with my gf and not only did we both love it. But finally after a year she can understand what I’m going through. \n\nSPOILERS!! I’ve said this in other threads but I love how her ocd makes her not able to kiss him at the end. My gf didn’t understand it at first but I told her that OCD doesn’t take breaks, even in big moments. And that it often causes us to miss out on a lot so it was fitting she still couldn’t even understand pressure\n Comment: I just watched it.\n\nThey got the brain focusing on that 1 thing perfectly.\n\nBrought back some bad time memories.\n\nIn recovery so I haven't felt like that in several years.\n Comment: i loved this book so much! i couldn’t watch the movie yet but i’m sure it’s just as good. it’s very nice to have ocd being portrayed in a realistic way not only the terrible and tragic punchlines.\n Comment: I LOVE IT SO MUCH AS WELL\n Comment: Okay so I read the book and it came out (I was an adult) and told my friend \"this is the most accurate description of my anxiety I've ever read!\" ...at no point did I think \"hmmm, if she and i share the same feelings, maybe*I* have OCD.\" It took like 5 more years for that diagnosis!\n Comment: I haven’t seen the movie but I’ve read the book and I loved it and found it very relatable\n Comment: need to check this out now!\n Comment: The book has a huge impact on me when I was younger and helped my understand my OCD diagnosis. I was so glad that the movie turned out so well and I hope it has the same effect for others it had for me as a teen. \n\nAdditionally, i loved that Aza was a character even beyond her OCD. I hate when characters become their diagnosis and I think the movie did a great job of side stepping that issue.\n Comment: Just finished the movie. Thank you for this.\nMight have cried a little. \nWell, they captured OCD so well.\n Comment: I watched it today and it made me feel so seen\n Comment: Agreed! This movie was great! I remember when the book came out and being so excited to get it because it was about OCD. But I couldn't get through the book because it made my thought spirals worse at the time. I really want to try to read it again now that my OCD is being treated.\n Comment: I just finished the book and it helped me feel so seen as a person with OCD.\n Comment: i cried my eyes out bro. i’ve never seen a fictional character with straight up OCD represented in regular media and it just had a huge impact on me to see it spoken about openly.\n Comment: I loved the movie, 9/10 I would say 10/10 but despite it really capturing the symptoms of ocd perfectly I wouldn’t have forgiven my best friend for saying and doing what she did. Me personally, couldn’t. But I get it some people don’t understand or have the capacity to empathize for people suffering.\n Comment: Is it in theaters?\n Comment: I’ve never related to a film character more than I did in this. The accurate representation has me sharing it with all of my friends. It just felt so much like my experience. I’m grateful that this film exists.\n Comment: Incredible movie. I loved how human it was, the way they balanced serious themes with heart and humor, how the portrayal was genuine. I just finished the book and I was worried they might change the ending to make it more Hollywood but they really nailed it.\n Comment: I Read Abt this show on the OCD Wikipedia page\n Comment: My therapist told me to watch it. I saw the trailer and an interview with John Green (w/a therapist from NOCD) about it and I’m definitely going to watch it. I was bummed though that, once again, it’s about contamination. But John wrote what he knew about his own struggles and I assume that involves contamination OCD, so I can’t fault him for that and appreciate his attempt at authenticity. I’ll be happy if it’s an actually accurate portrayal of any type of OCD. Does it touch on any other themes? I do wish that someone would make a movie about other types.\n\nHere’s the interview BTW: https://youtu.be/zM0EJiVB71w?si=_3zefFKpVHWuikpU\n Comment: I am glad someone is making movies about ocd in a real way. Haven't watched it but pleased to hear. \nI could have used that when I was young and didn't know I had OCD.\n Comment: I didn't know this was a thing even, will check it out ta\n Comment: The book is what first made me think “hey, maybe I have OCD”. I’ve been in anticipation for the movie for so long and it was amazing.\n Comment: I literally just watched it, I was obsessed, I felt so seen, they even had a reference to trich which I’ve never really seen in a film, overall so validating and representative\n Comment: Loved this movie. Also watch Pure, it’s a British show on Amazon Prime that covers sexual OCD. It’s very realistic\n Comment: I'm so happy to see that they got this right. The book was the first thing that ever got me wondering about OCD. (I wasn't dx'd yet, but related HARD to the anxiety spirals.) When I watched the movie, overall, I thought it did a great job.  I loved the representation of OCD. It wasn't just \"here's the thought, do this compulsion\", which I feel like OCD is normally portrayed as. There was some nice nuance (? not sure if that's the right word?) to the obsessional thoughts and HOW they spiraled.\n\n(spoiler warning for the plot!) >!Just like with the book, I feel the relationship between Daisy and Aza was a bit weird. I totally get the problematic elements with Aza being \"too in her head\", but it felt like the apology/forgiveness/the end of the film was almost a speed-run of an apology? It read that way in the book, too. I don't know how it could have been extended, but I feel like it should have been. To me, it has always felt too fast. They argued explosively, got in the accident, and then... poof? they're best friends again after a little apology? These were elements that built up and were issues for literal years! \\*shakes head\\* I dunno. It's just something that's always read as \"weird\" and \"off-putting\" to me, in the film, and in the book.!<\n\n  \nI did like how the ending showed some hope for Aza, though. That was nice. Even though this story focused on OCD, it wasn't the WHOLE of the movie.\n\n  \nEdit: posted a bit early, so I added a few more sentences/thoughts.\n Comment: Kinda off topic but is there homo relationship in the movie?\n Comment: What did you not like?\n Comment: I totally get that. I’m in my 30s and it definitely had that teen-movie cheesiness that isn’t for everyone. But OCD was so well depicted that I’d still recommend it.\n Comment: What a boob, where did they find that guy?\n Comment: Fr. They should have cut that scene. I heard he was the casting director tho\n Comment: Spoilers: >! I was so worried they were going to change the ending and Aza and Davis would end up together, that she’d ‘overcome’ her symptoms and the movie would have a typical Hollywood ending. I’m so glad they didn’t do that. The way they ended it was really honest and beautiful. !<\n Comment: So true about big moments. I was confessing to my husband on our fucking wedding day! OCD is a nightmare and I’d rather take any physical pain over the mental pain this horrific disorder causes.\n Comment: No problem! There were definitely a few gut punches in there\n Comment: It’s on Max\n Comment: It’s also kind of existential OCD. She’s afraid of microbes because they make her doubt her idea of what she is\n Comment: It’s largely about contamination, unfortunately. I don’t remember if there are other themes, so I can’t say for sure. I will say, it’s a BRUTAL portrayal of contamination OCD though\n Comment: That’s adjacent to my subtype, is any of it super triggering?\n Comment: I felt like the resolve between them after the accident was because of the accident. It scared the shit out of the both of them and they decided it wasn’t worth it to hold the grudge. If the accident didn’t happen I don’t think they would’ve talked for a while. Me, however, I am a grudgeeee holder and I’m not sure I would’ve found forgiveness as fast as they did even with the accident 😅\n Comment: There is not, but Aza’s friendship with Daisy is one of the main plot points\n Comment: I'm not the person you asked but I feel similarly to them. Its just not the type of book I usually like but I kept seeing it recommended so I read it. I did the audiobook and it impacted me when I read it about a year ago (as an adult) and I think about it regularly. Especially the relationship with her best friend and how they (mild spoilers) >!were in a turbulent place sometimes due to the main character's mental health creating barriers and her emotional blocks keeping her distant in the friendship.!< that theme hit home and tbh I may reread it soon after going through this thread.\n Comment: I personally felt like the love interest and best friend characters were really one-dimensional and I really could not find a single interesting thing about the love interest unfortunately. 😅 It also makes me not root for the main character as much because she’s honestly not a very good friend, and I don’t think that should have anything to do with her ocd. imo ocd can definitely cause problems in your relationships with people, but to me it felt like Aza was so focused on herself that she didn’t even care about her friend. (which one could argue was the point, but idk, it didn’t feel like I wanted to root for Aza because of it!)\n Comment: Absolutely, absolutely loved the moments of motivation she’d get followed by waves of panic whenever she pushed it.\n Comment: Ah gotcha. Yes I think my therapist mentioned this.\n Comment: Maybe, maybe not\n Comment: Interesting, thanks for sharing.. wonder if having OCD is a manifestation of selfishness in a way.. and in a way we might not be aware of.\n Comment: yea, I do think the movie is indicative of how ocd can take over your life",

        "title": "‘Turtles All the Way Down’ accomplished an extensive, heartbreaking display of OCD.",
        "text": "Tonight, while cooking dinner, I saw a trailer for Turtles all the way Down. I had never heard of it before, but it is a new movie adaptation of John Greens book. I have not read it so forgive me. I will not spoil the movie, however, it follows a girl struggling with hypochondria OCD.\nI’m sure the novel does a great job as well, but I had never heard of it until now. It’s available on Amazon Prime and HBO Max. The way the film switches between shots to showcase what is coming on in the characters mind truly displays something I have not seen in regards to mental health in a movie. \nI have struggled with hypochondria since I was 10 years old. This movie displays the constant struggle with this branch of OCD. If you have never heard of this type, or would like to view inside the mind of someone like this, please watch this film. \n\n Comment: I read the novel when it was first released… John Green himself suffers from OCD, if I remember correctly, so the portrayal of the protagonist’s struggles with it were intentionally written to be very realistic and honest.\n Comment: Did you ever see Marc Summers’ play? “The life and slimes of Marc Summers” he also deals with OCD and incorporates into the play in kind of an interesting way.\n Comment: I just still can't believe that today most people probably now know John Green from his books/movies rather than vlogbrothers.\n Comment: I don't know about that volleyball coach. Seems fishy.\n Comment: I don’t have any in-depth experience with OCD but I appreciated how the script took seriously in a YA way with horror movie flourishes how distressing the condition is to the protagonist. It is also sympathetic to how the condition is a burden to both the best friend and the boyfriend. They’re still perhaps more generous and understanding than people in high school probably usually are in real life but you as the viewer are appropriately forced to accept that even if the protagonist is pretty and means well, things are not and won’t always be easy for her in her relationships. I especially respected the “Raising Arizona”-like projection about an idyllic future that will include significant setbacks and relapses.\n Comment: Also a [damn great song by Sturgill Simpson…](https://youtu.be/6gBV-Nzq7Pg?si=8xmqOxbuiMMJtET3)\n Comment: Can I ask, as someone else who struggles with this, did you find the movie to be anxiety inducing or triggering for you?  I obviously have to avoid any type of medical show and I struggle with really any movie dealing with illness.  Sometimes watching stuff like this can even be enough to kind of set me on edge.\n Comment: I have OCD (the diagnosed kind not the TikTok kind)\n\nI don’t know what your condition is like but I’m kinda curious to look into this but I find depictions of OCD either wildly off or too accurate and makes me uncomfortable. \n\nMr Mercedes was a tv show where one character had OCD and her rituals and stuff was so hard to see since I know I do what she does. \n\nMatchstick Men also had a few scenes of Nic Cage with OCD cleaning which is me then and still now. \n\nIt’s weird how representation can be painful to watch\n Comment: Yep. Really impressive film! Didn't expect it to be that affecting tbh.\n Comment: I did read the book when it came out, and while it was very well written, it also left me feeling uneasy and... Maybe anxious? I didn't enjoy reading about these struggles. It was too real. I definitely recommend it though for people who don't mind more serious subject matters in their fiction.\n Comment: I know nothing about this movie or the book, but Sturgil Simpson's Turtles All The Way Down is one of my favorite songs, any connection or shared themes?\n Comment: Just finished this movie and I really liked it. It was cute and really resonated with me. I don't have hypochondria nearly as bad as the protagonist in this film (idk if it's even bad enough to be diagnosed) but I still find myself having spirals from time to time (usually if I'm like, cooking chicken or something and I'm afraid I didn't cook it enough before eating it) and seeing Ava try to argue with herself, telling herself that she's fine, but can't help from freaking out anyway, it felt really close to home. I keep thinking about it.\n\nAnyway, really glad this film's getting some attention. It was nice.\n Comment: I'm a fan of John Green and this sounds amazing.  I will definitely check it out, thanks!\n Comment: I'm just not a fan of how Green tends to approach his stories or write, it's just too cliched, but that being said - this was a really great adaptation. Maybe paced a little weirdly, but great. But moreover, yeah, the portrayal of OCD and anxiety is heartbreaking. That scene in the car and *that* scene in the hospital - man  Isabela Merced is genuinely very good.\n Comment: As someone diagnosed with OCD (and Tourette's, ADHD, depression and anxiety), I will add to the watchlist. I appreciated Michael J. Fox as Dr. Kevin Casey in Scrubs the most as far as portraying OCD, but Nic Cage in Matchstick Men and Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets weren't bad. I related most to Fox, though. Monk was way off, IMO. I've heard of OCPD? Maybe he was closer to that?\n Comment: You know that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you watch a movie? Not because it's romantic, or nostalgic? It touches a part of yourself, that you thought no one would understand.\n\nThat's how I feel about this film. The music and visuals, though not striking, were quite soothing. I especially liked the lighting when the lyric \"peel the mandarin\" came up. The opening, indie song seemed intentional. My brain slowed down, creating this humming. It was relaxing, and the exact kind of the mood the movie should have gone for. I also liked how Aza \"faded\" in and out. It was a smart portrayal of what it's like to have anxiety.\n\nThe acting is great. Isabela was a compelling lead. She was perfection in her physical acting. It looked like she trying to remain composed, rather than *being* composed. Her lines were spoken with a lot of heart. Safe to say, I was impressed. The rest of the cast was good. Felix was disarmingly wonderful. I think he has a lot of potential. Cree brings lightness, and a sense of humor to the film. The script is equally as good. One of my favorite lines was \"I just keep getting smaller, and smaller.\" I understood what was meant by that. Sometimes, your thoughts make you claustrophobic. You feel like life is going by as you try to cope. Before long, you don't feel like yourself. Hell, you feel like you're perpetually outside of yourself.\n\nThe scenes with Aza's therapist were incredibly well done. It brought me back to my own therapy sessions. Poorna nailed the cadence therapists often use. Practical, but not cold. Additionally, the fight with her and her mother was relatable. It's only after watching this movie, that I understand my own mother's perspective. I like that the film didn't shy away from the fact that Aza could be selfish. When you spend a lot of time focusing on monitoring yourself, you lose sight of others. In the end, though, she's not irredeemable. She's human.\n\nHaving no experience with OCD, I can't speak to its general accuracy. I do know what it's like to be overwhelmed by a 'thought spiral.' You don't feel like you have control. That said, Isabela truly impressed me with her hospital scene. No fancy camera work was needed to convey her desperation. I've watched one other adaption of a John Green novel. They're all simple, but beautiful. There's an idyllic charm they possess. Heartbreak turns into new love, and harsh truths turn into growth. This movie was very in line with what I expected.\n Comment: Somehow i seem to have missed the whole OCD part while reading this book younger. How dense must have i been?\n Comment: Not a movie but I remember The Imp of The Mind by Fletcher Wortmann being quite good.\n Comment: That’s weird.\n\n[I heard there’s so many problems with the movie.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjqeV_BbTBM)\n Comment: I LOVED IT ALMOST AS MUCH THE BOOK. IT MEANT SO MUCH TO ME AS A 14 YEAR OLD.\n Comment: I’m not a big reader, like at all, but I literally JUST finished the novel a couple hours ago & really enjoyed it. The whole time I was reading I kept thinking “I wish there were a movie on this.” & was SO excited to see it was released a couple days ago!! I just started the movie (couldn’t wait lol) & I love it so far, although now I understand why a lot of people say books are better than the movie! There’s only so much information you can fit into the length of a movie, so I absolutely recommend reading the novel!!\n Comment: This movie kind of pissed me off because I wish all I had was OCD. I'm autistic with anxiety, ADHD, OCD and I have major trauma from childhood abuse. My parents never took me to a doctor when I was young so I wasn't diagnosed as autistic until I was older so I never knew what was wrong with me. I've had a brain scan and have seen a psychiatrist and psychologist and have been clinically diagnosed as an adult now. Everything I could have done to understand my condition and improve upon my situation was wasted by neglect and everyone around me didn't understand my neurological disorder or didn't care.\n Comment: Looks so bad.\n Comment: I plan on reading it asap.\n Comment: I have not. I’ll definitely look intonit\n Comment: Is there a way to watch a recording of this?\n Comment: Out of all Green brothers projects, brotherhood 2.0/vlogbrothers is among the least well known. Complexly channels like Crash Course and Sci Show are massively popular on their own, the DFTBA store is used by a wide variety of creators, and Vidcon is known by almost anyone who spends a lot of time on english speaking youtube, almost regardless of who they watch.\n Comment: And here I thought we were talking about manager of the Swindon Town Swoodilypoopers and The AFC Wimbledon Wimbley Woomblys\n Comment: Personally, I was introduced to John Green through his books first (I read Looking for Alaska around 2009 or so) and Crash Course second (I was taking world history in high school right around the time Crash Course started). I wasn't even aware of vlogbrothers until John Green's surge in popularity around 2013/14 when the Fault in Our Stars movie came out. \n\nI'm willing to bet that most people younger than me are more aware of John Green as the brother of vertical video sensation Hank Green than anything else though. Hanks been killing it on Tiktok for years.\n Comment: Uhhhh…. He was a famous author before he started on YouTube… which is why he got a following for his videos\n Comment: I didn’t even know he was an author until recently.\n Comment: Why? Movies and books are more mainstream than random YouTube channels\n Comment: A great perspective.\n Comment: Yes it is\n Comment: I have diagnosed ocd, and it definitely can be triggering. i have my hypochondriac moments, and I had a full breakdown after. i also refuse to google what she was worried about. ignorance is bliss in my case lol\n Comment: It didn’t really trigger me. I’m very aware of the things I am worried about. She specifically was scared she would get infections and C diff. I’ve been worried about that before, but for me I was just wholly relieved to see a movie that I related to this much.\n Comment: Hi. I also have the diagnosed kind. Specifically, it’s hypochondriac. It’s obviously not 100% accurate, however seeing this character think about these things that I do, it really resonates with me.\n Comment: I don’t have OCD, but multiple friends do and I’ve been witness to their anxiety spirals. I had to turn it off about 10 minutes in because it seemed to capture that very accurately, and was very heartbreaking for me to watch. Maybe I’ll power through later but it feels accurate to what they’ve described.\n Comment: I totally get it. Also diagnosed OCD. Of the hypochondriac variety. As well as some other themes as well. I don't have the contamination OCD thats so present in this movie. But the whole idea of being freaked out how the body works and how easily things, in my OCD brain, can go wrong or stop working I relate to. As well as the thought spiral and the intrusive thoughts. I thought it was really well done giving an accurate example of what OCD might look like for someone, since we are all different in how OCD manifests\n Comment: I just had to respond to you because what you said resonated a bit.  I didn't know much about the Tiktok posturing for attention because of mental illness but as someone with diagnosed OCD/emetophobia it is a challenge every day.  I can't pretend to understand why it is currently acceptable or easy to see someone cleaning and go \"OCD teehee.\"  Alot of that damage I blame on Friends actually.  Look, Monica is OCD, it's funny.  But true OCD is NOT funny.  I panicked last night and threw my dinner in the garbage because I was going to \"get sick\" from it even though there was nothing wrong, then I had a panic attack because I felt guilt for doing such a stupid thing.  Therapy helps but it's never perfect.\n\nBut seeing John Green approach the subject gives me hope that it is an honest depiction and perhaps I should give it a try.  But representation  can be painful.  Closest I came to an addiction relapse was watching The Whale because of how he lived and it just felt suddenly sad and engaging to think maybe it is okay to binge and be an addict again even if for a moment.  \n\nI have seen more honest depictions of addiction however, I feel OCD is treated much less honestly and realistically.  No idea why.\n Comment: i feel similarly. i am a massive hypochondriac and it freaked me out to hear about all that bacteria\n Comment: turtles all the way down is a general phrase that gets referenced a lot, and based off of how genius.com interprets the lyrics to that song, there isnt a real connection between the two\n Comment: There are many different versions of where and when this expression is from. This is the one I've heard:\n\n\n\nThe following anecdote is told of William James. [...] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.\n\n\"Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it's wrong. I've got a better theory,\" said the little old lady.\n\n\"And what is that, madam?\" inquired James politely.\n\n\"That we live on a crust of earth which is on the back of a giant turtle.\"\n\nNot wishing to demolish this absurd little theory by bringing to bear the masses of scientific evidence he had at his command, James decided to gently dissuade his opponent by making her see some of the inadequacies of her position.\n\n\"If your theory is correct, madam,\" he asked, \"what does this turtle stand on?\"\n\n\"You're a very clever man, Mr. James, and that's a very good question,\" replied the little old lady, \"but I have an answer to it. And it's this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him.\"\n\n\"But what does this second turtle stand on?\" persisted James patiently.\n\nTo this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,\n\n\"It's no use, Mr. James—it's turtles all the way down.\"\n\n— J. R. Ross, Constraints on Variables in Syntax, 1967\n Comment: was wondering the same thing\n Comment: I also came in here wondering the same thinf\n Comment: Yes!! Do you wont regret it.\n Comment: It really just resonated with me so much. It’s just like me.\n Comment: Well in the book version they never actually say she has OCD like in the movie.\n Comment: Lmao at people downvoting you not getting the joke\n Comment: I’m sorry for all you’ve dealt with. That’s very tough. And you’re right to be upset with all you have had to go through. That said, while this is a fictional movie with fictional characters, I think one of the worst things we can do to ourselves and others is weigh and measure our pains & struggles against one another. This is one story about a person with OCD, anxiety and dealing with loss - and the only reason your story is more valid is because you are a real person. If this was your neighbor or a girl in Michigan, her struggle is not less of one than yours simply because you have more diagnoses. That’s not a fair way to think about or treat other people.\n Comment: If you have not yet, i would also suggest the anthropecene reviewed. \n\n\nGreat highs and  lowes from john green and it provides a lof of insight into some of his own mental health struggles and searches for meaning in this human centered world. \n Comment: His book is good too, Everything In Its Place. Of course the irony of a kids mess show host having OCD is part of it. One story that stuck out was that he would fixate on the tassels on his rugs.\n Comment: I dunno about that.\n\n> Vidcon is known by almost anyone who spends a lot of time on english speaking youtube\n\nI've watched a lot of Youtube, and I can only recall hearing about vidcon within vlogbrothers videos. Crash Course and Sci Show probably get a lot of play time in schools, but the average Vlogbrothers video does better than the average crash course and sci show video combined in terms of views.\n\nI suspect the film that grossed hundreds of millions of dollars (and the book with millions of sales) has the lion's share of public awareness, followed by all those other projects in the distance.\n Comment: > He was a famous author before he started on YouTube\n\nHe started doing Youtube in 2007 and became a famous author in 2012.\n\nThey launched VidCon in 2010 so he was more famous for his youtube stuff than his book writing until 2012.\n Comment: Please, he didn't become widely known as an author until 'Fault in our Stars' came out in 2012 when he blew up, 'Looking for Alaska', his first book only hit the bestseller list in 2012 once Fault came out. Green even said, for 'Looking for Alaska', he was getting awards acknowledgment but it only sold a \"few thousand copies\"\n Comment: Well.. he was already an author, yes, but he had a niche following.  Looking For Alaska was not a best-seller until 2012, well into his Youtube career.\n Comment: It’s like being proud of or watching a childhood friend becoming famous, it’s not a bad thing or surprising just surreal\n Comment: Really appreciate that.  Thank you.\n Comment: I have diagnosed OCD (well at the very least, diagnosed Obsessive Compulsive tendencies, but my therapist really wants me to accept being diagnosed instead of making up reasons why it’s not “real” lol) and 99% of it is the hypochondriac kind. I didn’t even know about this movie but I have a hard time consuming media or stories or experiences about OCD because I’m terrified I’ll like… “absorb” whatever they’re saying and suddenly their problem will become my new OCD issue. Do you have that problem as well since you have hypochondriac based OCD, and if so do you find Turtles still something that could be watched by someone with OCD?\n Comment: Thanks\n Comment: Same. She's literally me.\n Comment: This wasn't a real depiction of OCD, this movie used OCD as a sentimental ploy. If she really had OCD to the extreme nature of having sensory episodes then she would literally be mentally paralyzed. She wouldn't just be able to go and have a conversation about it with her boyfriend on an airplane.\n\nThis movie was trying to capture the audience's sentiment by having a girl overcome her struggles with OCD and showing she could magically have a normal life and if she just did what her psychiatrist says she will have a happy ending which is wrong.\n\nThere is no cure for OCD, this movie is a fairy tale. It also is the most privileged way of depicting mental illness that I have ever seen. It's unrealistic and so to respond to your comment, if this was my neighbor I wouldn't think to criticize them because what they would be going through is real and not some hollywood bullshit.\n Comment: Anthropecene Reviewed was so flipping great.  Found it during the pandemic and have listened to it at five times.  He's not merely insightful, he has a wonderfully candid take on his own humanity.  He talks frankly about his fears and tribulations and that sometimes a \"win\" after something bad had happened is merely taking the next step with more clarity.\n Comment: I’ll look into that too. Thank you\n Comment: And it's his I think only *non-fiction* book. Most of his publications are (young adult) novels and while generally good not going to be everyone's cup of tea. TAR is a collection of short essays covering a very broad range of topics from his perspective, presented as \"reviews\" like one might leave with an online retailer.\n Comment: I wasn’t in school when Crash Course or Sci Show was used in classrooms, but since they’re often used as teaching tools, I’d hazard the viewership count captured would be lower while actually reaching a wider audience (1 view = class of 20 kids), so I think it’s faulty to compare those views to vlog brother channel views.\n Comment: you probably arent watching enough youtube then since a lot of youtubers will either post a blog or at least mention on their socials that theyre at vidcon\n Comment: Yes. I am a huge hypochondriac. I’m on medication, in therapy, and have thought I’ve had every disease on the planet like 20 times. I’m constantly checking my pulse, heart beat, temperature, etc. however, this movie did not trigger me. I absolutely hate watching movies that are ‘medical ‘ based like greys anatomy or where people get sick and die. But for me this didn’t do that. I’ll go ahead and tell you, she’s worried she’s gonna get infections and C diff. C diff is a hospital acquired infection. It didn’t freak me out (even though I’ve thought I’ve had that before). Where I’ve struggled with hypochondria for so long, I just felt so much relief seeing a film based on it.\n Comment: As someone with OCD, I find your comment here extremely distasteful. Yes, OCD is a difficult condition to deal with and can severely impact your relationships, mental health, and future. I'm struggling just to finish school because of a mental break that was caused by OCD, when before I was taking on the most difficult curriculum at my school. OCD sucks and is debilitating at times. \n\nThat said, I've learned massive amounts about how to manage it through intensive ERP and extensive therapy outside of that. I am not broken and unable to affect my will upon my future, I am not controlled by OCD and my future isn't either, which is kinda what I'm getting from your reply. My mental illness doesn't own me, and will not prevent me from living a full life. \n\nThat's why I connected with this film. It illustrates the hardships of OCD but it doesn't torture it's viewers by imparting us with the belief that nothing can be saved. Aza doesn't magically have a normal life, she doesn't magically get the happy ending, she struggles but she fights for that happy ending anyway because mental illness isn't about having a disorder and suffering from it, it's about having a disorder and overcoming it's consequences. That is what I truly believe. \n\nAlso, projecting what your experience would be onto a film isn't a constructive way of looking at it. You may be paralyzed in some situation, you may be unable to get on that plane, but Azas struggles are different from yours and the focus of her illness is too. \n\nI'm not parroting this film as the paragon of mental health rep, nor am I saying it's particularly well structured or even has cohesive character writing in certain characters. Hell, some characters are so underwritten I couldn't care about them when I should have.\n\nBut going on and saying that this film depicts a fairy tale version of OCD is the most grossly pessimistic thing I've heard in awhile, and in my opinion undermines all the progess that can be made with a mental illness. \n\nI repeat, I and others with OCD are not defined by OCD. It isn't a fairytale to live a fulfilling life with a mental illness.\n Comment: I think you are in the minority in your opinion of the film’s depiction of OCD. Regardless, that wasn’t the complaint you made in your original comment. You said it made you mad because you wished you *only* had OCD. My reply was focused on that take, and the disservice it does to anyone struggling with mental or physical health issues, or really struggling with any part of life at all. No need to downvote because I challenged you on that line of thinking.\n Comment: If you want a taste, there's a video from the podcast version talking about auld lang syne that is very good\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nGzeMNxqpYU\n Comment: Not sure why you got downvoted for this. Vidcon is huge. A lot of creators have attended over the years and I’ve managed to see content featuring Vidcon from creators that I don’t even watch regularly. There was a point in YT vlogger history where you’d just see 10 povs of the same day or even the same interactions. There were 55,000 attendees in 2023 and when it was cancelled in 2020, they estimated it cost Anaheim & creators 60 million.\n Comment: This is really good to hear, I have been wanting to watch the movie but was scared about how I might respond to the movie and spiral. I have emetophobia as well and I have been searching everywhere trying to figure out if the are any scenes where people get sick in the movie. Do you remember if there were any scenes in the movie?\n Comment: > I think you are in the minority in your opinion of the film’s depiction of OCD.\n\n\"But you don’t need to read it that way, since OCD isn’t only a metaphor. It’s a syndrome that exists. “Turtles All the Way Down” makes Aza’s OCD just specific enough to draw us in, then deals with it in a way that’s just manipulative and sugar-coated enough to leave us thinking, “Yep, it’s another YA movie.” This one, directed by Hannah Marks, isn’t badly done, yet the film is as reassuringly formulaic in its use of OCD as Aza is ritualistic when it comes to dealing with it.\"\n\nhttps://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/turtles-all-the-way-down-review-1235992272/\n\nThe book maybe different but this movie was horseshit. The only thing this movie does that's good is brings awareness and empathy to mental illness however, when people can't recognized because it doesn't look like Hollywood horseshit then it will still go unnoticed.\n\nThis movie did piss me off because I do wish all I had was OCD and there is levels to this, even with my situation I still check my privilege when comparing myself to others in more severe situations. I don't think I am out of line when asking this movie to do the same.\n Comment: i put that on every new years eve, it's so good\n Comment: That was a good cry\n Comment: There was one scene where the main girl gets sick but I think it lasted mere seconds and could easily be fast forwarded through.\n Comment: I just don’t really see how you expect a fictional film like this to ‘check its privilege.’ No character or film…or real person, for that matter… can depict every component of an experience because experiences are inherently unique. I’m not defending this film as the second coming of representation of OCD experiences, all I’m asking is why does it need to be more than a story of one person’s experience with OCD? Does it deserve to receive ire from individuals (specifically from you, because, again, that was the point I had about your original comment) simply because this character didn’t suffer MORE? IDK, I feel angry about my circumstances pretty often, but I’m not blaming a film for not fully capturing them nor am I mad because so many people have it easier. It just is. This is life.",

I know of the Sturgill Simpson song but just curious about the origins of \"turtles all the way down\"\n\n\nETA: Autocorrect tried to change his name to Struggle Simpson, I enjoyed that and thought I would share\n Comment: Been excited for this movie since I read the book, which I absolutely love. Green has very positive things to say about it. And I'm all for Judy Reyes appearing in anything.\n Comment: John Green has a heart of gold and is one of mg biggest inspirations so I can’t wait!!!!!\n Comment: A New Film, you say?\n Comment: I haven't read the book yet but this poster makes it look like a zany romcom, which is not the vibe from what I've heard\n Comment: So, “love’s the only thing that ever saved their lives?”\n Comment: I thought he movie wasn't get made, but glad it was. It's a fun book\n Comment: This book was darling.\n Comment: John Green is a national treasure\n Comment: I hadn't heard of the book, but the trailer is intriguing and Isabela Merced is going to play Dina in TLOU S2.\n Comment: That this is not a TMNT movie is so disappointing.\n Comment: GNU Sir Terry.\n Comment: Shouldn't it be Kangaroos?\n Comment: Borderlands GoTY has this written all over as graffiti all throughout the game.  I had no idea it was an actual title of something, I just figured they hated turtles or something.\n Comment: Cowanunga!\n Comment: Damn, I'm going to need to read the book then.  Got a signed copy a while back but never got around to reading it.\n Comment: Is this like an April Oneil origin story?\n Comment: Is this the sequel to Mutant Mayhem?\n Comment: This isn’t the turtles movie I ordered\n Comment: What is this show about the poster leaves it very vague. Are the two girls sisters, friends or lovers, all three?\n Comment: cannot wait! i ve been waiting fir it for years already\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Filming finished two years ago and they’re finally getting around to releasing it.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: thought this was going to be queer based on the poster, am disappointed\n Comment: HOLDS UP SPORK…\n Comment: The new Gen Z coming of age story written by a 40 year old man.\n Comment: The vlog brothers can eat shit\n Comment: Sequel should be You Can Have the Crown.\n Comment: I mean, we did have the anime.\n Comment: i am so happy this is top comment\n Comment: I will always up vote Sturgill Simpson.\n Comment: The Dead Don’t Die. You’re welcome\n Comment: That expression is far older than Sturgill. He was probably referencing the Bertrand Russell story, but maybe the World Turtle mythology in general.\n Comment: He didn’t come up with the phrase turtles all the way down. You know that, right?\n Comment: Sorry who is he and how is he related to the movie?\n Comment: Who the fuck is Sturgill Simpson?\n Comment: Wait isn’t let it snow adapted? On Netflix?\n\nEdit: Also coincidentally Isabella Merced is in that too\n Comment: Will Grayson Will Grayson is by far his best book. I would love a miniseries.\n Comment: I've only seen Fault in our stars. Are the rest of the movie adaptations worth it ?\n Comment: You forgot the Anthropocene Reviewed. Might make a good series. Maybe a different director for each part.\n Comment: Seriously, between this and \"Splinter\", the lack of ninjutsu adolescent chelonians is severely disappointing.\n Comment: Was definitely expecting a poster for a new TMNT movie so was a bit surprised when that was not it.\n Comment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j5JQipGhgI\n Comment: I’m not regarded, but I like rocks\n Comment: Basically, there’s this old joke about a philosopher giving a speech about the creation of the Earth.\n\nAt the end of it, he opens the floor for questions, and this woman stands up and says, “Actually, that’s all wrong because the Earth is actually resting on the back of a turtle, which is resting on yet another turtle.” When the philosopher asks her what THAT turtle is standing on she says, “It’s turtles all the way down.”\n\nThe connection to the book is that the main character of the book has OCD. She has these irrational thought spirals that make existing very difficult for her because she can’t get out of her own head. As a result, she spends the whole book trying to cope with where her illness ends and she begins. She’s basically trying to figure out HER origin story.\n Comment: Have you seen Birth/Rebirth? Judy Reyes is incredible in it.\n Comment: Probably the last John Green adaptation we’ll ever get since he’s done with fiction and it doesn’t appear that Abundance of Catherines will happen.\n Comment: T’aint been long since the last yin ither\n Comment: The best kind of poster/trailer sometimes\n Comment: the book was good ngl\n Comment: They go all the way up.\n Comment: John Green, but the difference is minuscule.\n Comment: Who the eff is Hank??\n Comment: Why are you sure it will be awful?\n Comment: It’s about OCD?\n Comment: What? Why?\n Comment: Do you think young people were writing the coming of age stories that you watched when you were a kid?\n Comment: It’s mostly a book about OCD, which Green has. \n Comment: Yes, and?\n Comment: Why?\n Comment: That seems like more of a third movie, imo.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: While I love Sturgill Simpson, The Dead Don't Die is one of the most painfully boring movies I've ever forced myself to watch. He was good in his small part in KotFM, though.\n Comment: His IMDB also lists Killers of the Flower Moon and The Hunt.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Incredibly talented alt-country musician. I highly recommend his bluegrass album, Cuttin' Grass\n Comment: He’s the country artist who loses his truck, wife, and dog, then drops acid and tells you to stop worrying about him. His albums Metamodern Sounds in Country Music, High Top Mountain, and A Sailor’s Guide to Earth are fantastic.\n Comment: Wearing this shirt rn\n Comment: Yeah. It wasn't remotely faithful to the book which kind of shocked me.\n Comment: I didn’t realize, aight, edited\n Comment: is it really worth it? i ve surpassed the age for JG books but have never read that one.   it s literally the only one I have not read. should I read it?\n Comment: Looking for Alaska is a miniseries but it's very good and so is the book.\n Comment: i d say yes.  I did not like let it snow tho\n Comment: That’s why I specifically said YA fiction, because he’s said that Turtles will be probably his last in that style. TAR makes a great podcast and a great book but I can’t really imagine how most of it would be visually adapted.\n Comment: Aaaaaa CHELONIAAAAAAA!!!\n Comment: Damn and I thought it was a Terry Pratchett reference\n Comment: totally not relatable.nope. not one bit🫠\n Comment: Oh yeah, she and Marin Ireland were both great. And I've loved Judy Reyes since I started watching \"Scrubs\" at 11 - truth be told, I had kind of a crush on her. Hoping this is the beginning of a Reyesnaissaince!\n Comment: When did he say he's done with fiction?\n Comment: Oh crap yeah ahah :,3\n Comment: Hank is a sausage covered in batter and deep fried. \n Comment: John Green’s brother, slight misinformation post\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: “John Hughes wasn’t a teenage kid during all of the 80’s??”\n Comment: Lmao if teen fiction could only ever be written by authors the same age as their characters then we would have The Outsiders, Eragon, and that’s the end of the list.\n Comment: When your entire writing catalog is just coming of age stories as you age they are going to connect less with their intended audience because generational concerns differ. \n\nStephen King was smart in that he wrote almost all his coming of age stories in the 1950s during the time he grew up so it never seemed detached from current day.\n Comment: Too much relativism and spineless political correctness.\n Comment: It’s definitely a number two\n Comment: Sturgill Simpson Presents Sound & Fury\n Comment: Sound & Fury, on Netflix. It’s basically an anime style (among others) visual album for his album of the same name. It rules.\n Comment: Dragon Ball Z\n Comment: It's so bizzare to me that my wife and I laughed the whole way through. It was only later I learned everyone else hated it. \n\nWe liked it enough to thrown on Only Lovers Left Alive immediately afterwards because we craved more Jim Jarmusch. I guess we're just weird.\n Comment: It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie making fun of movies. 11/10 fuck your math\n Comment: He also had a small role on The Righteous Gemstones.\n Comment: Hey, fair enough. Was genuinely just trying to be informative. I *think* that specifically \"turtles all the way down\" is from the Bertrand Russell story of the woman who spoke up at one of his lectures. But I could be wrong.\n Comment: I read it in a different stage of my life since it came out 14 years ago, so it might not have made the same impact on me today. But it hit its target audience which was me as a 18 year old gay man at the time for sure 😂\n Comment: It’s a reference Terry Pratchett made!\n Comment: It sort of is as he did actually reference it in  Q&A session\n Comment: I can’t agree with everything you said more. You clearly have great taste. Thanks to your comment I know she’s in this and know to check it out when it drops. Cheers!\n Comment: He posted this on his YouTube channel last year: https://youtu.be/ep9_JuN24Eo\n Comment: \n[I’m slowly becoming an internet fossil.](https://youtu.be/bHA-Sjw7XE8?si=0RkHydoFRfjyrYk1)\n Comment: No it’s from eastern mythology/philosophy.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Be honest, you've never actually read any of John Green's books, have you?\n Comment: Stephen King was 10 years old in 1957.\n Comment: Dude stephen king was 12 the last year of the 50s, he did not write all his coming of age stories when he 3-12yrs old\n Comment: > Stephen King was smart in that he wrote almost all his coming of age stories in the 1950s during the time he grew up so it never seemed detached from current day.\n\nFunny  you should say that. Whenever King writes kids/teens in his modern day set books, they sound like *Leave it to Beaver* era Boomer kids.\n Comment: I think that’s a weird opinion to get from them but you’re free to express it!\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: 💦💦\n Comment: I saw it in the theater and laughed all the way through. Everyone else sat quietly. I guess they needed a laugh track to get this dry humor.\n Comment: I've tried to understand how it could be enjoyed but I just can't. The scene of Driver flying in driving the smart car got a solid laugh but the rest I just couldn't get.\n Comment: No I second this. Hilarious movie. I couldn't believe nobody I know liked it.\n Comment: It’s so deadpan that I think people couldn’t find anything to latch onto for humour, but I was splitting at the seams from the first scene through the end.\n Comment: No shit. He was in that prepper cult and sang on the stage? I didn’t catch that when I watched it.\n Comment: Yes that particular expression is from that story.\n Comment: Aww thank you! Cheers to you back, my friend!\n Comment: He explicitly said he's still writing fiction, but who knows when a book will come out.\n Comment: Pause\n Comment: Phrasing!\n Comment: I think this person means the stories are set in that time maybe? I have only read one or two King books tho.\n Comment: It's definitely a wild ride.  Caught it once randomly (I think it was a Netflix recommendation) and was like \"Wtf did I just watch??\" Lol\n Comment: We're both in our 40s? That may have something to do with it.\n Comment: Good to meet you, brother (or sister as the case may be)! 😉\n\nEdit: It's exactly that.\n Comment: “…I don’t know when or if I’ll publish one again.” \n\nHe is writing a non-fiction book about tuberculosis and also published a non-fiction book in 2021 called The Anthropocene Reviewed. He does write fictional stories and shares them in his newsletter or charity streams but there’s zero guarantee any of those will ever be published.\n Comment: The Anthropocene Reviewed was excellent, IMO his best book, nonfiction essay format plays to his strengths as a writer more than teen fiction\n Comment: The Anthropocene Reviewed is one of my favorite pieces of writing. I listened to the podcast first and later read the book when it was released.\n\nIt really helped me when I was depressed, overworked, and isolated during the pandemic. Green believes so deeply in humanity, and Anthropocene communicates that in an uplifting, infectious manner.",

What makes their stories so good?\n\nThis trailer looks interesting, I’d never heard of this story before and didn’t know it’s based on a book.\n Comment: I've loved reading literally everything John Green has written (including “the Anthropocene Reviewed” and even “Let it Snow”) but haven’t been brave enough to watch ANY shows based on the books for fear they just won’t capture his magic.

It's also a pretty old phrase.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\n Comment: i was really hoping this was TMNT related\n Comment: They do go into the sewers though.\n Comment: Care to elaborate? Watching this trailer has me interested in the movie and the book.\n\nI deal with similar anxiety, as I’m sure a lot of folks do, so  this topic actually intrigues me and seeing how other people deal with and learn to overcome or live with it certainly helps me process my own anxiety….even if it’s a fictional depiction.\n Comment: Stay in school, kids\n Comment: Pretty much the same. I love his non-fiction though. The Anthropocene Reviewed is a fantastic podcast, and it has a book with all the same essays + extra.\n Comment: Not specific experiences I don’t think, but he openly struggles with his mental health.\n Comment: I don't think the events in this book are based off his experiences per say, but he does have OCD and I thought the book was a great representation of that aspect of mental health.\n Comment: Can't speak for the person you wrote to, but I have some ideas. John Green often writes his teens with a sort of hyper-intellectual dialogue that can feel unrealistic for teenagers (or most people in general). Some people don't like that. I could also see not liking it if you can't relate to Aza's spirals.   \n\n\nI personally liked this book. I don't relate to all of Aza's issues, but some of it I really felt to my core.\n Comment: Thank you for the response. I plan on giving this book a shot at the very least and see how it goes.😁",

I read the book whenever I was a mentally ill teenager without a supportive parent who would take me to therapy and help me figure out my bullshit, so reading the book made me realize something might be Wrong and lead to me eventually seeking therapy by myself.\n\nAs a YA movie it felt really authentic and true to the book. It harkened back to the YA Movies I used to see on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel, like *Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging* or *Holes*. I feel like we don't get as many of those anymore, movies targeted at teens that don't talk down to them. Something between the sanitized representation in Disney Channel shows (some of them try, but as soon as they push the envelope they get unceremoniously cancelled) and the hypersexuality of shows you'd find on the CW. If these streamers want to pick up the baton for mid-budget, slice of life YA movies that actually appeal to teenagers, I'm all for it.\n Comment: > A teenager with OCD notices a mystery surrounding a fugitive billionaire and accidentally solves it a week or so after forgetting about it.\n\nFTFY\n Comment: I definitely thought the mystery aspect would be a bigger part of the movie, but then we got to less than 10 minutes left I genuinely thought we weren’t ever going to get an answer. Then when we do it seems so rushed and random. I’m curious if it’s a bigger part in the book or if it’s very similar.\n Comment: A week late to the party, eh?\n\nThe movie is a great adaptation of John Green’s novel with great performances from start to finish.\n Comment: John Green's cameo was perfect.  10/10.  Don't give him time to act and you won't be disappointed!\n Comment: I like John Green stuff, but this felt a little flat and unsatisfying.  I generally liked the thought spirals and the microbes and how they showed that.  Good job of making it feel real.  But I guess I wish there was some payoff to it, and the missing father line.  Usually things that are based on books seem more well-written in terms of plot.  Setups and payoffs.  Character and plot arcs.  This seemed more like a day in the life kind of show, with a mystery plot tacked on for some suspense or intrigue that is quickly forgotten and then \"solved\" with no point at the end.\n Comment: Just watched and I had a couple questions. Why didn't they tell the police about the note?  Did the brother show the note to the police before showing the girls?  I presume not because it wasn't taken as evidence.  Did anyone tell the police about the camera?  Would the police be at all curious why one of the kids would take the dad's private jet?    \n  \nThe sons seemed mostly unbothered about their missing dad. Also not really concerned about helping the authorities find him.   Especially the older brother who only broke down after they told him they found his body. \n\nMaybe I missed the cliche part of movies like this where kids try to give the police important information but the police are like \"Shut up, kids we got this\" and the kids are like \"ok I guess we're on our own\"  and then solve a crime.\n\nMaybe the book was better.\n Comment: The movie definitely came off a little half-assed compared to other adaptations of his novels, like The Fault in Our Stars. The acting needed work across the board. I didn't recognize anyone (except Geri from Succession!) and no one wowed me with their performance. The guy in particular was like cardboard. The entire mystery subplot was largely unnecessary. Basically it all felt like I was watching a TV movie, lacking focus and gravitas.\n Comment: It's good but I absolutely loved paper towns, the fault in our stars and the looking for Alaska tv show so this felt underwhelming compared to those ones in my opinion. Main love interest had litterally no character other than nice rich hot guy\n Comment: I was really impressed by Cree Cicchino in this. I want to see how her career develops.\n Comment: Interesting\n Comment: This movie had so many random and unbelievable things happening - it seemed so uneven to me.  This boy just gives her $100k cash?  The almost murder mystery that seems to disappear? A huge car crash? These are all events that an entire movie could be based on, but they're just passing things in this movie.  Very odd plotline.\n Comment: Good film, would recommend \n Comment: I never read the book and I just saw the movie. I really LOVED the idea and concept behind the movie, I think it was illustrated very well, although after reading some of these comments I realize there are some \"random\" aspects to it that come up, but I didn't think much about it while watching it. Some of yall are being way too harsh, this is a young adult movie and its significantly better then most I mean have any of you guys watched the kissing booth? I'm a young adult and I thought it was great, I just know that the people writing these comments are in there 40s.\n Comment: I feel like Aza’s refusal of treatment most of the story makes her a really unlikable character (having struggled with major depression and anxiety/panic disorder my whole life)…she’s surrounded by phenomenal people who love her despite it and completely ignores the ways in which that refusal negatively impacts herself and the people around her.\n\nSome of us aren’t so lucky to be surrounded by support, and the fact that she so completely takes that for granted just rubs me the wrong way and makes me want to shake her. I understand she’s a teenager, but still. All I could say during the movie was TAKE YOUR F*CKING MEDICINE, FFS. At least TRY something.\n\nI also am disappointed that nowhere in the movie (still need to read the book) is the argument that “she is her mind”—implying that she is her illness, so treating it is erasing herself—countered by her psychiatrist. Would a person with Type 1 Diabetes be erasing themselves by taking insulin? I worry about the young people who will see that perspective and internalize it since it wasn’t directly challenged.\n\nAlso the fact that we don’t see her doing her treatment long enough for her to improve also kind of shoots hope in the foot. She’s suffering at the end almost as much as she’s suffering at the beginning, and TONS of people have OCD and experience more relief with therapy and medication than we see her have. Idk. I adore John (and Hank), but yeah. This wasn’t my fave.\n Comment: Haven't seen the movie yet, but the book starts about the mystery and then it's mostly about how her OCD is effecting her with a little coda about the mystery at the end I believe. \n Comment: Book spoilers: >!It's nearly identical. Aza gets all the clues and is in Pogue's Run when she starts putting it together, then starts smelling rotting flesh. I liked it slightly better in the book because the body was in the dark tunnel where it makes more sense that it would have gone undetected, and really gave Davis and Noah an option of how to handle the situation. What they did is better for the medium - you need something visual for a movie, naturally - but it just made a bit more sense in the book.!<\n Comment: Most of this was in the movie, but I also read the book, so I may have filled in some gaps on my own.\n\nThey didn't tell the police about the camera because they don't want the police to be the ones to find their dad, because at the time, they assume he's alive, and they don't actually want him to be in prison. Mostly, that's just because he's their dad, but it's also because Davis has a lot of control over his dad's estate while he's only missing. Remember, once he's dead, his will has his whole estate going to the Tuatara. Davis is also an emancipated minor. That answers the question about the jet - Davis is largely just running his dad's estate at this point, and his dad's employees are going to listen to him when they don't have a good reason not to.\n\nThe cops do know about the note, at least in the book, but they haven't made the connection between Pogue's Run and Jogger's Mouth.\n\nThe book definitely had more Noah, and really showed how he was being affected by his dad being gone. I think they just cut a lot of his role for the sake of screen time.\n\nOnce Aza finds the body, they're left with the choice between leaving their dad to literally rot, or losing the estate to the Tuatara researcher. They opt for the latter.\n Comment: >I didn't recognize anyone\n\nIsabela Merced is in the instant classic Madame Web\n Comment: You didn't recognize Debbie Ryan?? As soon as I saw her smirk I had a flashbacks to [Radio Rebel](https://youtu.be/FjIn_rZitl8?si=IifEcMjAd1FFdiHA)... I think she's really improved since then!\n Comment: Judy Reyes (Gina) was also in Succession!\n Comment: Yeah the boyfriend character in these female led YA stories are always horrible actors.\n Comment: loveee her in the sleepover (even if it’s a ridiculous movie) and i feel like she plays a similar character as she does here\n Comment: I read the book first then watched the movie, and I agree that the movie felt a bit... weird.\n\nIn the book the plot was the same but the sequence of strange events didn't feel as disjointed, probably because of we tend to question these oddities in books less because of them having a sense of \"heightened reality\", while movies tend to be perceived more realisticallly. I loved the book and thought the plot made sense, as it basically served to parallel the \"spiraling\". But the movie definitely felt random at times.\n Comment: This is an absolutely garbage take. This is the point of the film. I have struggled with OCD since childhood and I was not surrounded by support. OCD is wildly misunderstood, and you prove it with this comment. This is why people don’t tell people about their struggles. Treatment doesn’t erase its existence. Medication rarely helps. OCD ensures that you never believe in the good (the phenomenal people that love her that you reference, which her best friend had been shit talking in a blog for 7 years… phenomenal ❤️) I related heavily with the idea that getting treatment would be erasing myself, because that’s what OCD does. It convinces you that you’re safe as long as you play by it’s rules and only when you play along. Did you also think the youth will get the wrong message from rinsing their mouths with hand sanitizer?? Ffs. I guess people are just unlikable because they don’t seek treatment for a disorder that people like you perpetuate the stigma of.\n Comment: Yeah the book describes solving the mystery as happenstance, they got lucky and that's it. The mystery is minor in the book\n Comment: Interesting, thanks for sharing.\n Comment: She was also the lead in the surprisingly good Dora the Explorer film.\n Comment: And will be in s2 of The Last of Us\n Comment: and scrubs\n Comment: Yeah, in the book I bet you get much more context about these events and they probably don’t seem to happen so close to one another\n Comment: Yes. Not seeking treatment for diseases and disorders should be stigmatized. Your mental health is YOUR responsibility and you have a moral and social obligation to at least fucking TRY. If she had been *trying,* that changes the entire character. But she was not.\n\nIt’s not the *disease* I’m judging. It’s the refusal to try things that could improve it. I speak from experience too, if you actually read what I wrote. The difference is that recovery became *my mission in life* until I found something that worked. \n\nAnd I’ve seen the effects of not treating mental illness firsthand by the *dozens* of fucking suicides I’ve seen throughout my life that wreck the lives of everyone in their wake, including my fiancé finding his ex hanging in her bathroom. She also refused treatment. I’ve also seen it firsthand in the lifetime of fucking abuse I’ve suffered at the hands of people who were supposed to love and protect me but were broken and in denial of their mental illnesses. They also didn’t seek treatment. I’ve spent my entire life trying to recover from the effects of their negligence.\n\n\nAre you antivax too? Same fucking thing.\n\nAnd re: treatments not working; that’s not what the data say. “About 7 out of 10 people with OCD will benefit from either medication or Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).” \nhttps://iocdf.org/about-ocd/treatment/meds/#:~:text=Medication%20is%20an%20effective%20treatment,and%20Response%20Prevention%20(ERP).\n\n70% isn’t *rarely.* If you’re trying and still suffering, it’s a fucking bummer and it’s not fair and it sucks; we live in a time where there’s still a lot of progress to be made in terms of understanding mental illness and its treatments. But you have an obligation to *try.* And keep trying.\n Comment: And she's about to be a much more household name with Alien Romulous and Superman: Legacy (as Hawkgirl) coming up.\n Comment: I watched that Dora movie because I was bored and wanted to mock yet another shitty live action adaptation of a beloved IP. And despite my cynicism going into it, I ended up loving the movie. It's so self-aware and Isabela Merced's performance was definitely a standout, I wish that movie did better.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: An excerpt from “The OCD workbook” by Bruce Hyman and Cherry Pedrick..\n\n“People with OCD are often reluctant to seek professional help, even if it’s available to them. There are often feelings of shame and embarrassment at the notion of seeking the services of a mental health professional. You may be inhibited by the notion that seeking help would be an admission that you might be “crazy.” Many people with OCD obsess that they may be crazy and fear that the doctor will only confirm their worst nightmare…” \n\nIf you don’t have OCD, you simply don’t get it and you never will. Whooptie do for you that you were in a place to try. You’re lucky you don’t know what it feels like to be so paralyzed by that fear that it would prevent you from getting help, love that for you. \n\nI love the cherrypicked statistic, but as someone who is medicated, heavily vaccinated, in therapy, and been there done that… it does benefit, but as far as this life-changing, omg the “feelings and thoughts are just gone and now I can get on Reddit and condescend people who aren’t in a place to get help like the ever-so-important and noble me….” doesn’t happen for everyone like it did for you. \n\nMy obligations are limited to death and taxes just like everyone else’s. Regardless of how you view it. We are talking about a fictional character, one that doesn’t truly encompass the reality of every person who has OCD, but one of those realities is being to afraid to start medication and engage in therapy. Fuck you.\n Comment: And The Last of Us\n Comment: Where did I say my depressive and anxiety symptoms are gone? Anxiety disorders across the board are notorious for medication non-compliance; that’s not isolated to OCD. ALL mental illnesses come with shame until the illnesses themselves aren’t stigmatized. I also was in poverty, so getting help was incredibly more difficult, so I wasn’t “in a place” where I could get help—I made it fucking happen through sheer will and tenacity. I also taught public school while I had panic attacks that lasted *months* while also having hyperthyroidism that sent my symptoms through the fucking roof. I had the *same* health hypervigilance, the *same* fear of being “found out” that I was insane and losing my job and life, and fuck, may have had undiagnosed health-related OCD. But guess what? I didn’t say “no thank you” when push came to shove because 1) it was what I needed to do to survive and 2) the people around me didn’t deserve to suffer (mainly my students bc I don’t have a family who gives a fuck about anyone). So whoopdie do your fucking self. You don’t know me, either. Plus, you think you have more of an obligation to *taxes* than the people in your life? Talk about garbage fucking takes.\n\n\n*You* were the one who condescended first, sweetie, about this “fictional character,” too, nonetheless. Fuck you too 💋\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Congratulations on being just as unlikable of a person. Enjoy your death and taxes\n Comment: Will do! ❤️",

        "text": "There’s a new movie on MAX called Turtles All The Aay Down. An hour in I was sobbing at good the representation is and how it really feels like understands the OCD experience. Especially her reluctance to take her medication. \n\nHowever, as someone who has a procedure coming at a hospital, I shouldn’t have watched it so close. C.Diff is now all I’m going to worry about because I have to be in the hospital for a few hours. I am deathly afraid of infections and losing any part of my colon or bowel. So, if you watch it know it actually may trigger a new fear. sort if like when we read someone’s post here and we resonate with him but then take on their theme for a few days \n Comment: I first read Turtles All The Way Down when I was in the psych ward. The author John Green has OCD and I feel did such a great job realistically portraying it. I feel the movie was done very well too. I cried multiple times during it. \n\nSo much of Aza’s experience mirrors my own. The interference with relationships, hating yourself for not just being normal. Her mom reminds me of mine. Aza’s attitude with the psychiatrist was very similar to how I was as a teen. I appreciated that Aza isn’t immediately “better.” \n\nAnyway, I second the recommendation, but YES it might make you cry and maybe be painful, but still meaningful and so good.\n Comment: Hi. I just wanted to reach out as someone who has diagnosed OCD, and as a survivor of C Diff. \n\nI had C Diff several years ago in my 20s. I did not obtain C Diff from being in the hospital. I got it by taking too many different antibiotics over the course of 6 months prior to my infection. C Diff can grow out of control if you take too many repeated doses of what’s called broad spectrum antibiotics. Certain antibiotics wipe out the good bacteria in your gut, so the bad bacteria like C Diff, can start to multiply and grow out of control. \n\nFor me, I knew something was wrong when I was on day 2 of diarrhea that felt unlike any diarrhea I’ve ever had before. To be blunt, it smelled like death, and I felt like I might be dying because I was in so much pain from abdominal cramping. I went to the hospital. They misdiagnosed me with food poisoning and gave me antibiotics. I took them. This, as you can imagine, made things even worse. I ended up at another hospital in septic shock because at this point I started bleeding out via diarrhea. \n\nThankfully I started treatment right away and it worked after a week long hospitalization. My husband was told to go home and throw away everything in our bathroom that couldn’t be bleached, and he did. He never caught it. Neither did anyone at work, or at any of the other locations that I used toilets. \n\nThings I do to help prevent another infection include taking a daily probiotic and eating yogurt daily, avoiding certain antibiotics, and thorough hand washing.\n Comment: Well fuck. I guess when my aunt gave me that book years ago, it was just another jab at me. I never read it because I thought it was weird that she would even give me a gift, let alone a book. I loved books, but her reasoning did not dawn on me until I read this post and the comment. Just reinforces why I don't talk to anyone on that side of the family anymore.\n Comment: I’m not diagnosed (yet) but I strongly suspect that I have ocd\nAnd when i watched this movie, I was bawling damn it was just so relatable 🥲🥲",

I swear that first turtle had a soup spoon!\n Comment: Surprisingly (since it never seems to work out this way), I got my Bachelor's Degree in Technical Communication. It's a bit of a niche skillset, so having the degree definitely helped get me noticed in this career.\n\nI had always been interested in writing and editing and took classes focused on it during high school. During that period, I discovered that I was naturally good at explaining difficult things in their simplest terms and had always been willing to help friends edit their papers. People always said I should be a teacher, but I can't stand children in large groups like that.\n\nA placement test suggested I should be a technical writer, and I thought, \"Writing and editing instructions all day sounds boring...\" But then realized I regularly was helping people with their computers all the time and writing them detailed instructions on what to do if they ran into that problem again. And then I thought, \"Wait... I could get paid to do that.\"\n\nAfter getting my degree, luckily, someone in my network was looking for new talent to write educational videos for camera and lighting equipment. This had been a hobby I was knowledgeable in, so I knew the type of content they were looking for, and was successful taking their highly technical spec sheets and turning it into something a consumer could more easily understand.\n\nBut, over the last decade, I've grown and moved around a bit to a few different industries. Eventually, I landed in my current role and now work with an international team, where one responsibility is making sure our documentation is localized for our US audience.\n\nTL;DR I've always liked / been good at writing and editing, focused on those subjects at school, got a degree in that specialization, and had networked well enough that I was able to get my foot in the door at the right time.\n Comment: It only takes about a day of learning Japanese to understand why machine-translating it is so inaccurate.

No one ever understands how I explain things.\n\nOnce me and another student spent 20 min arguing about the solution to a physics problem until we realized we were talking about the same thing but approaching it differently.\n\nI guess I never imagined people could be so good at it that they literally work with it. Very cool!\n Comment: Korean is similar, Chinese not so much.  The main problem is the embedded context.  I've seen so many things translated from Japanese to English that are technically accurate, but obviously translated by someone who could not see how it would be used — so it ends up being wrong.  I wish I could remember the exact phrases used, but one case I remembered had two signs in Japanese that said the exact same thing, but they relied on the context of the sign to omit the subject of the sentence.  You can't do that in English, so they needed to have two separate English translations.  They didn't, so one of the signs didn't make sense.\n Comment: Thank you for explaining. I have always understood the idea that English is a hard language to learn. However, I took Latin in high school,  which, of course, relied almost entirely on written translation.  Them, in college,  I took Spanish, and I struggled with oral translation but could easily translate written documents.  So you can probably see why I had trouble understanding why written translation was often so weird.  It's so much easier than trying to translate something spoken to us.\n Comment: We also have grammar bots though. I'm sure they can combine them.\n Comment: I completely agree. That's why I support turt reform.\n Comment: Not far enough\n Comment: Stomping turts.\n Comment: You should get that checked\n Comment: > However, I took Latin in high school, which, of course, relied almost entirely on written translation\n\nLatin has plenty of great examples of why it's so difficult. Think back to doing a translation, and how you had to figure out which nouns/adjectives went with what(I'm sure you've had the experience of misidentifying a word, only to realize it's actually a completely different word and part of speech from what you'd thought it was), recognizing stylistic constructions(I no longer recall the terms for them, but things like when they'd drop esse during repetition, or when one sentence would mirror the one that just happened and you'd have to supply missing verbs/nouns from context), and of course the ever-present question of which past tense makes sense in this sentence. Is this something that happened a while ago but has since stopped? Is this something that started a while ago and is still happening? Is this something that happened once in the past and never again? Dunno, the latin probably isn't telling me explicitly, so I have to use my brain and try to figure out what makes sense!\n Comment: Filibuster\n Comment: Smashing Drowing Pumpkin Tortises\n Comment: Also, you can't just say perchance.\n Comment: Seems content. Plenty of ooze.\n Comment: The easier thing with Latin is that it is one of the base languages many modern languages use.\n Comment: Tax Shellter\n Comment: I feel like I made myself perfectly redundant\n Comment: Happy Halloween!\n Comment: perchance.\n Comment: It might be easier to translate it into french or spanish, yeah. My experience was with english. While english does borrow a fair bit from romance languages(sorry, not borrow, I mean *mug in a dark alley and rifle through their pockets for vocabulary*), its structure is primarily germanic, so you're still translating into a different language family. The vocabulary is the easy part.\n Comment: Thank Mr Skeltal for good bones and calcium\n Comment: Sad Byepoou?\n Comment: Lol i love the analogy. \n\nBut seriously, it's why my parents encouraged me to take Latin in HS.",

The female would regularly \"play\" with the male by kicking off his favorite sunning spot and holding him underwater until he struggled. \n\nThere was a pond and creek near my family home with other red eared sliders, so during summer when I was home I let them loose. Poor dude turtle got stuck in some rocks after being too excited about his newfound freedom and his bully sister actually came by and got him loose.

I had, had experience with snakes, who are pretty indifferent to people. curious at times, but \"affectionate\" isn't usually a descriptor for them.\n\nMy tortoise bumps walls when he wants me in the room, smashes his shell into me when I'm not paying enough attention to him, if I get down on the floor he'll try and crawl on my face looking for head pets and shell scratches.

He was awesome, but he was a fucking asshole too. If your fingers got remotely close CHOMP. I had to have the tip of my index finger broken 10+ times as a kid. Why? I always wanted to pet his smooth little head :( \n\nEventually I got into High School, and a little cousin of a friend thought Rocky was just the coolest thing,  so Rocky got a new home with new little doofy fingers to bite. \n\n\nHope shits cool Rocky, hope you don't hate me for giving you away, but it was for the best.

I wonder if I've actually seen a famous turtle, that's awesome.\n Comment: Myrtle has got to be my favorite zoo/aquarium animal! She is HUGE and has been at the New England Aquarium forever - I've seen her several times over the couple decades of my life but there are literal grandparents today who grew up seeing her.

I doubt the poster would actually be fined or jailed if they scratched Myrtle, but they would almost certainly be fired. People who work with endangered animals tend to take the work *extremely* seriously (for good reason)\n Comment: is scratching a turtle considered a white collar crime\n Comment: As long as you phrase it better than \"I touched a turtle\" I'm sure you'll be fine.\n Comment: \"[What are you in for?](https://i.imgur.com/2yAbA3v.jpg?1)\"\n Comment: And I said, \"*Petting a turtle*.\" And they all moved away from me on the bench\nThere, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I\nSaid, \"*And violating the federal Endangered Species Act.*\" And they all came back, shook my hand,\nAnd we had a great time on the bench, talkin about crime, mother stabbing,\nFather raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the\nBench.\n Comment: Sea turtles are waaaayyy less aggressive than box turtles.\n Comment: I used to have pet rats. Outside the cage they were like sweet little puppies but if you stuck your finger in the cage between the bars to poke their belly or rub their heads they'd bite.\n Comment: introducing some of my favourite GIFs:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/FIWaK5X.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/FIWaK5X.mp4)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/D1ZrTvw.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/D1ZrTvw.mp4)\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/kZWWepk](https://imgur.com/gallery/kZWWepk)\n Comment: Why do people get exotic animals that can maul you?\n Comment: \"Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin ~~slitting throats~~ scritiching heads.\"\n Comment: Friend ahead, behold, dog!\n Comment: Her consent seems freely given, enthusiastic, retractable- but how do we know she’s informed?\n Comment: She’s 100! She deserves a little scritch, as a treat.\n Comment: ah yes but have you considered that we need to utterly control the lives of all 'lesser' animals, for their own good, you see\n Comment: No, but they could absolutely get in serious trouble with their job, potentially up to the point of being outright fired. I’d be willing to bet they were given specific instructions about things like not petting the turtle.\n Comment: I Doubt a competent trial would lead to a conviction for just head scratches, unless it hurt the animal\n Comment: No but it's still a good call to not do it for various reasons.\n [There is a full breakdown about this in the replies which I think is very cool knowledge if you're interested!](https://www.tumblr.com/why-animals-do-the-thing/736605663362514944/having-volunteeredinterned-at-this-facility-i)\n Comment: I fed my turtle too many crickets one time and he projectile shat across his tank. It was like a 6ft long tank. I have never EVER seen something shit almost 10x its body size.\n\nSo you must be able to shit across a large room in order for me to accept your turtle club membership.\n Comment: Turtle, turtle! Are you turtle enough for the Turtle Club?\n Comment: Yep that's 99.9% for sure to be Myrtle. She's an icon.\n Comment: I was actually just in Boston in July and went to this Aquarium, and I definitely remember Myrtle! I even have a picture of her on my phone!\n\nI got to the end and heard the name Myrtle and went \"Wait, THAT Myrtle?!\"\n Comment: Cause of the small numbers of these kinds of animals there's a good chance of you've seen one, it's a famous one. \n\nI've seen a famous crocodile on vacation because it's one of the only ones that gets seen by anyone. It takes part in nature tours and is old as fuck and rather distinctive battle wounds from other crocs.\n Comment: Haha r/subsyouthoughtyoufellfor\n Comment: me neither, which is good since I'm stuck with the little bugger for awhile yet haha.\n Comment: De Chelonian Mobile\n Comment: My highschool chemistry teacher. She apparently used to have such a potty mouth that now whenever she feels compelled to curse in class, she says tutles instead.\n Comment: Bebop, Rocksteady and Shredder?\n Comment: Blue collar, unless it’s Donatello then it’s Purple Collar.\n Comment: Green collar crime\n Comment: Someone tell that to the Burnside Fountain Turtle Boy in Worcester MA.\n Comment: Stick your finger Myrtles face and find out lol.\n Comment: \"surely they're called snapping turtles because they like Snapple let me piss it off\"  \n\nThat first one's getting judged by the ER crew.\n Comment: The thrill of experiencing them allowing you to love them and not maul you.\n Comment: I'm not sure you're that experienced on turtles if you think \"Eastern Box Turtle\" is some shady black market exotic pet dealing lmao\n Comment: They read/watched Franklin and then didn’t understand turtles.\n Comment: she's 100 y.o., i have to believe that she's aware of the potential consequences of *head scritches*.\n\nand it's probably less dangerous than her tantrums. steel is harder than fingers.\n Comment: Oh no absolutely I expect that I was just wondering if they would actually press charges or just a gtfo\n Comment: \"Alright, welcome aboard! We're glad to have another face at our aquarium.\"\n\n\"Glad to be here! Any other rules I should know?\"\n\n\"Well, you can't pet the turtle.\"\n\n\"I quit.\"\n Comment: What bad thing could happen though?\n Comment: Can I ask why though? Is it because she could become sick if random workers touch her? I'm just curious.\n Comment: I'm imagine like an onboarding course with a big PowerPoint slide just saying \"DON'T PET THE TURTLES 😠\"\n Comment: Done.\n Comment: I shall administer the test.\n\nWhat does a man do standing up, a woman do sitting down, and a dog do on three legs?\n\nWhat is a four letter word for \"intercourse\"?\n\nWhat is it on a man that is round and hard, and sticks so far out of his pajamas that you can hang a hat on it?\n\nWhat does a cow have four of and a woman only two? \n\nIf you can answer these four questions you may take the final question. \n\nAre you a turtle?\n Comment: Yes, *that* Myrtle, aka \"Mooching Myrtle\", the (former) pet turtle of Moaning Myrtle, who was shipped to the States for protection during WWII and decided to stay in Boston because of a shared hatred of tea.\n Comment: I used to say \"Fuck\" and \"Son of a BITCH!\" a lot but when my daughter was born I had to change things up. \n\nNow I'm \"Flippin Biscuts!\" and \"Son of a Boiler!\"\n Comment: There is a beach where sea turtles frequently go to eat algae that grows on the rocks in the shallow water. You're not supposed to get close to them, but the turtle's don't know or care about the fragile laws of mankind. They'll swim up from behind and bump into you, or swim under your feet and get stepped on. They don't care if that happens, all that matters is that sweet green seaweed. \n\nSome are used to being (illegally) fed by tourists, and will nip your hand for attention if they think you're holding food. Even then they tend to hold back enough to not cause a real injury.\n\nBut yeah, I've had my hands in a green sea turtle's face and it was fine.\n Comment: The people who are ALLOWED to touch her literally have. Like OP has explicitly said this turtle loves to be scratched the reading comprehension here is literally zero\n Comment: K.\n Comment: It's like the difference between a golden retriever and a rottweiler.  \nMyrtle clearly likes her scritches. I think you'll be fine.\n Comment: So basically the same reason why I love cats?\n\nOkay, I can respect that.\n Comment: This would force science and legislative bodies to consider that if Mytrle has the understanding to consent, then a lot of other animals do too. And that would bring to question most modern farming practices. I say this as someone that eats meat on the daily; I recognize my role as an omnivore but also that if I'm an animal, and Myrtle is an animal, and the cow at the farm is an animal, then we may be a lot more similar than we think.\n Comment: Never allowed around giant turtles again...\n Comment: Pet the turtle, believe it or not, straight to jail\n Comment: First thing that comes to mind is messing with the feeding habits. It's like when 1 person in the household doesn't stick to your dog's routine, it messes up the slightest things but it will make a difference. Increased begging behaviour and what have you. Maybe they're using the head scritches as a sure-fire way for her to come up, but if she got an hour of scritches from another turtle-lover, she might not be so eager. Just an example of what could be the benefits of scritch-control.\n\nYou just can't do science if you don't have control at least in theory.\n Comment: To the person or the turtle? Nothing to the turtle, but turtles have very sharp beaks and can take fingers off. Go ahead. Pet it's head. I double dog dare ya.\n Comment: She's a giant 100+ year old sea turtle protected by the endangered species act. She is quite literally illegal to touch because she's an endangered species! Wild.\n Comment: ....holy shit he did it\n Comment: Adapt. Evolve. Innovate. XD\n Comment: My mom's go to was \"geezaloo\". \n\nMy dad's was and still is (I'm spelling this phonetically because I know absolutely no italian) \"mingya fach\" which I'm pretty sure means penis face. No he does not speak Italian. Yes, he had to yell at us when we repeated it as children.\n\nSo now sometimes I say \"geezaloo\" or my dads thing when I'm frustrated, never know which it'll be tho. My parents are very different people....\n\nThankfully I don't have kids to listen to the things I say because i never know if it will be \"what the heckeroo!\" or a string of curses like a sailor. I have no in between.\n Comment: 'Mother-Fudger' is the one I use the most\n Comment: I always tell people that you don't just stop cussing. You replace the words for more acceptable ones.\n Comment: Im having flashbacks of snorkeling and being surprised by sea turtles and how much they just dont give any fucks and will bump / slap you with 0 regrets. I have a scar on my leg from being practically bodied by a 3 legged turtle into a rock when trying to get out of the water\n Comment: Hello 911 this man did a feed the turtle.\n Comment: Da ReEdInG CuMpReHEnsiON, I was being silly you stick in the mud.\n\nLook, I owned a turtle. You stick something in front of their face, they snap at it. Sure, you might be able to pet it on the shell, the fins, around the head area, and that's great, just don't stick yout fingers in front of it's mouth. I think that's a pretty universal rule for all animals really, but especially turtles with their sharp ass beaks. That's how you lose a finger.\n\nJust because the turtle is semi chill, and tolerates people, does not mean it will hesitate to bite the fuck out of you for no reason. It's an animal.\n Comment: I'd say, if we we keep the cow comparison, Artificial Inseminationg is more \"an aspect of the job\" for cows than head scratches are for turtles. Head scratches are something that's clearly not necessary health-wise and are done for Myrtle's pleasure. Artificial Insemination, on the other hand, could be argued to be an essential component of the job that we assign it. The desire to feel pleasure (head scratches) and the desire to maintain sexual dignity (Artificial insemination) are also different enough that they need to be proven seperately and not be one implying the other. So *if* we want to go that route, it could perhaps lead to entire \"animal professions\" being outlawed or completely restructured, which wouldn't be a bad thing at all.\n Comment: gtfo = giant turtles friend OBSLUTELY NOT!!\n Comment: If I had to lose a finger, I'd want it to be while scritching a sea turtle\n Comment: Sorry I didn't know. I thought animals that were protected by these acts just couldn't be killed or kept as pets I didn't know it goes as far as to say you cannot even touch these creatures. Not that I EVER would I'm just stating that I was unaware.\n Comment: She.\n Comment: I have absolutely no idea where I picked this up, particularly since I don’t have and am not around children and usually use pretty typical cuss words, but sometime in the last year I’ve caught myself saying “fudgesticks” in place of swear words for when things like stubbed toes and the like happen.\n Comment: 🚨 🚓 🚨\n Comment: I find your knowledge lacking if you think any animal is just waiting to bite the fuck out of you with no provocation. Most of the animals people keep are a lot smarter than we give them credit for, reptiles in particular. Take it from some experts if you don’t believe me. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=poRt9kbxogI\n Comment: It would make things like docking the tails and ears of dogs VERY illegal.\n Comment: Giant turtles FIEND, OBVIOUSLY\n Comment: I'm not sure what the law says explicitly with regards to touching, but the reason isn't really anything crazy. \n\nThese individuals have specific patterns, feeding habits, etc. The trainers simply don't want those interrupted because they could be detrimental to the animal, in ways the trainers can't predict. \n\nThe person petting the animal might not be trained to handle that animal. They could be hurt, or they could accidentally hurt the animal.  When the animal is endangered, every individual is critical to the survival of their species.\n\nYOU might be perfectly respectful and know how to pet it, but the rule doesn't really want to take that chance, especially when the animal is critical to its species.\n Comment: They'll make an exception if you're saving it's life but otherwise you're not allowed to interact with them at all really.\n\nMy dad used to get in trouble a lot with the local fish and game wardens because the dolphins wouldn't stop harassing **him**. The inlet where he would swim has a pod that frequents it and they like to play \"shove the human\" the dolphins never hurt anyone but they would circle you while you were swimming and boop you off of floaties and if *they* get caught *you* get in trouble.\n\nThe wardens never cited anyone and no one's been arrested but they make you leave and go swim elsewhere.\n Comment: There is a reason there was a reddit post a while ago where one person claimed they had found a stray turtle crossing the street, took them away and intended to keep it as a pet, everyone came out of the woodwork saying they just commited a federal offense, and any attempt at parlay was met by people basically reading them their Miranda Rights.\n\nDo not touch the turtle. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.\n\nApparently you should only touch the animal if it is in immediate danger, and drop it as soon as it is safe, and even that has exceptions and you might be caught anyway and serve jail time and/or fines, so better let nature take its course, or YOU will be an endangered species.\n Comment: Bro really covering his ass on Reddit lmao\n Comment: Grow a penis, I can't be wrong on the internet.\n Comment: My knowledge is lacking when I literally owned a turtle... that I got bit by several times... because I stuck my fingers in his face... yes, turtles generally will bite the fuck out of you with no provocation. They think you're food, or a predator. Either way, nom.\n\nI've owned all kinds of animals. Wild, domestic, and in between. *Don't stick your fingers in front of an animals mouth, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S NOT A DOMESTICATED ANIMAL* \n\nI've rescued feral dogs that love me, and will only take commands from me, but if I step the wrong way, they will growl at the least or at worst bite the fuck out of me. It's not that they don't love me, they just have much stronger boundaries and will let you know a lot quicker when you push them.\n\n I don't recommend interacting with wild animals honestly. I'm just a doofus who loves animals and saves them when I can, even when most people would euthanize for aggressive behavior.\n\nYou really have to know that a lot of these zoo animals have one or a few handlers they're cool with, and no one else can go in the tanks for the reason that the animal will become defensive and aggressive because it's an unfamiliar person in their home.\n Comment: Good.\n Comment: Giant turtles FORBIDDEN, of course\n Comment: Completely understand!\n Comment: Seems like that's more for the swimmer's safety than the dolphins'.\n Comment: Way ahead of you there.\n Comment: Yeah, your first paragraph basically sums it all the way up for me. You stuck your fingers in his face. Multiple times. *That's provocation.* You didn't learn after the first or even the second time not to do that with that animal. \"Lack of knowledge\" was the phrase I went with, and it's the phrase I'm politely sticking to.\n\nSome animals will never be safe to put your hand in front of their face, even if you can safely interact with them otherwise. This is doubly true with wild/abused animals, which people definitely should not interact with without specialized training/knowledge appropriate for the specific animal in question.\n Comment: Right??? Sort of… finally??!\n Comment: I'd personally be more comfortable swimming with sharks but the odds of being attacked by either is pretty negligible. \n\nI'd still be more concerned about the animal, you never know what some idiot is going to think is funny.\n Comment: I'm more worried about those who are horny.",

You said a \"jackdaw is a crow.\"\n\nIs it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"crow family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people \"call the black ones crows?\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?\n Comment: You know I really have no idea [but this Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle) has a naming and etymology section that doesn’t disagree with the user you replied to. Granted maybe there is more information proving the opposite further down in the article? I didn’t finish reading it.\n Comment: All tortoises are in fact turtles—that is, they belong to the order Testudines or Chelonia, reptiles having bodies encased in a bony shell—but not all turtles are tortoises.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Bold of you to assume\n Comment: Creepy and with The Witches, totally anti-Semitic, unfortunately\n Comment: What the... what?\n Comment: My grandma’s pond turtles that she kept outside also got stolen. :/\n Comment: I love this reaction to seeing that video for the first time lmao\n Comment: Sharks are fish, humans are apes, penguins are birds, bananas a herbs. It has feet dude, it’s a tortoise\n Comment: Turtle = rectangle. Tortoise = square. \n\nEverything w a shell like that is a turtle. If it needs lotion for its dry ass skin and doesn’t f*ck with water, it’s a tortoise (but still also a turtle, like a square is still a rectangle)\n Comment: The only acceptable creep.\n Comment: Sharks are fish, dingos are dogs and penguins are birds. It’s got feet dude, it’s a tortoise\n Comment: Aww sounds like one happy tort!\n Comment: The type in this photo grows huge and can live for 100 years. Most of them will be abandoned by their owners who think they are cute at first. But then they just keep growing and eating.\n Comment: There is a lot of /r/confidentlyincorrect material in this thread. The worst one is the guy copy and pasting the same thing in multiple comments and being debunked in a reply every time.\n Comment: It’s like saying a shark is a fish, yeah it is but also nobody describes a shark as a big fish with teeth, they call it a shark. \n“yo wanna come see my turtle this weekend?” “Sure man what kind of turtle you got?” “One with feet.”\n Comment: The [Nashville Zoo](https://www.nashvillezoo.org/our-blog/posts/turtles-vs-tortoises) disagrees with you. As does [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/shell-game--how-to-tell-a-turtle-from-a-tortoise).\n Comment: You got me, I concede. Tortoise does not equal turtle. I have learned the error of my ways. I will now delete Reddit.\n Comment: Whut\n Comment: this post was manually deleted in protest against the api changes\n Comment: Just r/oddlysatisfying\n Comment: Sorry but it's just the two of us.\n Comment: #OH YEAH\n Comment: Tortoise love is really great, but sulcatas are not the easiest to keep... they are big strong tortoises, and can escape most confinements with sheer bulldozer determination and strength.  A friend had one that would break thru drywall and hollow core doors, and had to have the outdoor fence sunk into the ground and set in concrete.  They go from cute tiny hatchlings to large tanks.  Sadly, a lot of people get these without doing the research, only to learn the hard way that they aren't prepared to provide them with the life they need.\n Comment: I wanted to get one, but read that they need an acre or more to roam to be happy.  Got (from a rescue) a much smaller dessert tortoise.\n Comment: It’s easy to tell the difference actually. Tortoises aren’t good at martial arts and prefer veggies to pizza.\n Comment: What about a box turtle? Should we make a new word so dumb people know it can't swim?\n Comment: It's an older code, sir, but it checks out\n Comment: Chefs kiss.\n Comment: Ahhhhhhhh i think this is a matter of metalanguage and common language mixing.\n\nAlso america Britain and Australia have different common uses. \n\nBut turtle can be used as a name for the order meaning the tortoise name wouldn't matter taxonomically.\n\nBut the tortoise is a distinct family within that order so using tortoise points to specifically that taxonomic family while the other families within the testudine order are turtles.\n\nI guess its like saying shark and fish. Sharks are fish, but distinct enough that we separate them from normal speak as fish. Same as seahorses (yes, they are fish)\n\nThis is important to me because it comes up in the curriculum breifly, the difference between turtles and tortoises. And I'm just plain fucking mad about science\n Comment: Just like with toads and frogs. All toads are in fact frogs. \n\nI like turtles… and frogs!\n Comment: Such a long winded opinion.\nSorry but a tortoise is a turtle no matter how you paint it lol. You cant change a fact because people are not educated.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I too had a tortoise stolen... A desert tortoise inherited from a family friend that passed away. Wound up getting him back but he was so mistreated (probably living solely off grass instead of fruits and veggies he was used to) his shell had become deformed (instead of being round it curved at the sides like a coke bottle) and he died within 2 years. His remaining siblings are still going strong. Makes me so mad, he didn't deserve that. \n\nWould not have thought this was a common phenomenon, what the hell is wrong with people.\n Comment: Look up box turtles. It's not as simple as \"land feet = tortoise\" in testudines!\n Comment: But not really? Because if you call a banana an herb people will be confused but if you call a tortoise a turtle, many won't even know the difference.\n Comment: You are correct! It does have feet and it is a turtle!\n Comment: Bills a big boi. He makes funny noises when he sees the plate of food. He's gotta be around at least 60 lbs now\n\nEdit tort tax:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rUc87kN\n Comment: Are you talking about the turtles or the human?\n Comment: Except that nobody has a problem if you call a shark a fish, but a lot of people dont understand that tortoises are turtles.\n Comment: No you can be redeemed!\n Comment: Reading that I imagined Darkside Anakin pacing back in fourth raging about Benihana and Palpatine is just standing there awkwardly regretting his decision of taking him in.\n Comment: Not on the turtles please\n Comment: Hopefully they have a rat friend and some of the lettuce is laced with mutagen.\n Comment: I also choose this guy’s turtle\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Jesus Christ…\n Comment: I have a desert tort. She'll get about as big as a football full grown, she's only about 8 years old, she has a 8' x 15' pen, and we're working on giving her a 5' x 100' pen (basically the last 5 feet of our yard), because we feel like she doesn't have enough space where she's at.\n Comment: You did the smart thing, research the needs of an animal before you acquire it. I can't believe how many people who live in the northern part of the U.S or in Canada acquire these tortoises.  One tortoise organization has published the \"Sulcata Challenge\"  which outlines the realities of owning these future giants. Sulcatas do not hibernate and must be fed and sustained at suitable temperatures all year long.\n\nPeople are living in a fantasy world if they think that any credible zoo will take it once it gets too large for them to handle and house.\n\n https://turtlerescues.com/sulcata\\_challenge.htm\n Comment: Lmao.  Take my free award.\n Comment: Hate to break this to you but most species of Box Turtles (North American) can swim and they ARE turtles and not tortoises. They don't swim well but they can do it and will do it in the wild at times. Now, there are also Asian Box Turtles some of which are fully aquatic so don't judge a turtle by it's shape.\n Comment: Bro you answered your question already a box TURTLE is a turtle and can swim.\n Comment: I love your science madness! Actually [here is another article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoise) that supports what you’re saying! It makes sense that some people would commonly call the whole group of things by one name (especially if they only encounter one family).\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Holy shit. 30 years? That’s fucking heartbreaking dude..\n Comment: Oh no. I'm so sorry this happened to you. It's so absurd that it's not even funny anymore. But are you sure that the neighbor didn't just took him to his house and said \"Oh I saw a person taking your tortoise btw. It was definitely not me tho.\" yk\n Comment: Why would you steal them anyway. Unless you are some crazy activist trying to set them free it makes no sense. If you want one, you can get them on all sizes from shelters for cheap or free.\n\nWithout stealing someone's long time buddy.\n Comment: So you just assume people are as uneducated as you?\n Comment: Please pay the tort tax. Thank you.\n Comment: That is one big tortuga!\n Comment: 😂\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: It should be illegal to trade in sulcatas.  They are not good pets, and they so often are abandoned that the rescues often can't take them.   To anyone reading this who thinks they want a sulcata anyway,  check your local rescue... they probably have some adults needing homes.\n Comment: he is too busy to help us, seeing how he built the tortoise\n Comment: This makes me sad to think of the painted turtle a friend of my parents gave me as a birthday gift when I was very, very young (probably 5 or 6 years old). My parents were, justifiably, Not Happy to have a sudden turtle foisted on us, but I was delighted and named them \"Mr. Turtle\". \n\nI remember now what a small enclosure he was given, like something you think of as a classic fish tank- I'm sure it was no more than two feet by one foot, at most, with a couple flat rocks to sit on but also meant only half of that tank was really something he could move around in. We would take him out once a day or so to walk around a bit, but I'm sure my little self was always picking him up and not just leaving him be at his own pace and really considering him as a separate, living thing.\n\nAfter a couple years my parents told me he \"ran away\", and only a few years after that did it one day suddenly hit me...hold on.\n\nI am now an adult and at least know enough to know turtles need MUCH more- including space and peace- in order to be able to lead a decent life. I am very sorry, Mr. Turtle.\n Comment: This. Thank you\n Comment: Sorry to break it to you but nowhere did I say a box turtle was a tortoise. I was merely pointing out that him using a water habitat as a point between turtles and tortoises is silly. Im sorry the point went over your head. Here it is in layman's terms:\nIt doesn't live in water yet its called a turtle and not a tortoise. Get it? That's the only point I was making because he believes land = tortoise and Water = turtle. \nYou're really making my point for me, thanks! \n\nAnd some box turtles can swim, you're right on that. But that's hardly the status quo. Many struggle because they have toes (gasp) and not webbed feet like the Asian box turtle. So again, thanks for making my point.\n\nEdit: as someone who has raised land and water turtles for over 20 years, it brings me joy you are all so ignorant to words I had no part in defining. I'm sorry you're wrong.\n Comment: A parrot can talk, not all parrots talk.\nA box turtle can swim, not all box turtles swim.\n\nBig difference between a boxed turtle and a normal aquatic turtle.\n\nIn the years I've worked with water AND land turtles, I have seen plenty of boxed turtles who drown better than they swim.\n Comment: Everything went over your head.\n\nKeep downvoting,  tortoise is in fact a turtle. Y'all are insanely upset over a fact.\n Comment: It's only important to uneducated people. I'm not changing my language because people in your life are uneducated. There is far too much accessible knowledge on the subject. With your logic I can toss a box turtle in a lake.\n Comment: Tortoises ARE turtles ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)\n\nedit: Imagine downvoting a simple joke you're trying to correct and turns out it was factually right. Must be real fun at parties!\n Comment: Its kinda like people who buy their kids bunnies or chicks at Easter. There's always a ton for sale on craig's list like a week later once people realize how much work they are.\n Comment: Are all of your comments this condescending\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: You aren't changing your understanding of the language because the language CLEARLY differentiates between turtles and tortoises, you are one that's uneducated enough to not do so.\n Comment: You probably can toss a box turtle into a lake. Those guys are built to swim just fine. \nSource: have a 30+ year old box turtle who gets a weekly swim.\n Comment: Now that you mention it, later in life I spent about four years volunteering at a wildlife rescue that was largely for birds, but would take in turtles, bats, squirrels, etc when they needed a rescue and we were the only one available. I honest to god wonder if I was subconsciously doing some kind of penance for how awful we were to that poor turtle??\n\nYour comment just triggered the memories of how every spring, yep, dumped ducklings and chicks (often dyed bright colors- awful) would be found in parks or on the streets and brought in to us.\n\nedit: jesus I'm getting angry all over again remembering the time an elementary school teacher brought in a shoebox with a few live chicks she'd hatched with her classroom as a \"science experiment\" and she dumped at the rescue because she didn't \"need them\" any more.\n Comment: Only to those who try their hardest to be right when wrong :)\n\nToo bad down votes don't change facts.\nA tortoise is a turtle.\n Comment: I'm sorry you're uneducated on the subject too.\n Comment: As I've stated elsewhere that's completely possible but I have seen plenty of boxed turtles in the last 25 years that will drown much better than they swim.\n Comment: I mean, the downvotes are because you're being an asshole.  \n\n\nI'd rather be ignorant than rude any day of the week.",

With the exception of Raphael, who's clearly an angry cabby.\n Comment: https://preview.redd.it/e3avpbkovvxa1.png?width=2696&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56b92e4b948cf15959f152c088efbc8bedbbe890\n\nThey sound like him.\n Comment: So Itsreal85 was speaking prophecy?\n Comment: This really seems like a deliberate Dwayne McDuffie/Milestone homage. It's the 30th anniversary of the founding of Milestone and there's the McDuffie infamous [Teenage Negro Ninja Thrashers](https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-138/) Go Fuck Yourselves Marvel Pitch.\n\nI only interacted with McDuffie a couple of times on the old Television Without Pity forums. I thought he was obviously very smart, absolutely thoughtful, and always willing to participate in an open dialog with viewers. This is unlike Aaron Sorkin, who was busy having a meltdown and condescending to everyone like a sulky teen over on the West Wing boards, but Sorkin copied and pasted the entire interaction into a West Wing script and won an Emmy. So WTF do I know.\n Comment: As a black person, I hate seeing the word “nigga” on every post. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_down). The canon is very cool tho!\n\nEdit: spelling\n Comment: Never knew Michaelangelo was a short king\n Comment: Green Niggas is niggas, come on now we know Piccolo was black af.\n Comment: Raph’s got them Static Shock vibes\n Comment: Cool post. The title is atrocious though.\n Comment: Anyone know what comic this is from?\n Comment: I'm trying to tie this back to Uncle Phil voicing Shredder in the OG cartoon\n Comment: I feel like people view certain non human characters as black because there has been a lack of actual black characters in some popular shows/media. Some dbz fans would say Piccolo is the black character in dragonball lol. Then you have the animation trope where black characters are transformed into non human things. I'll just say it's interesting and leave it at that. I prefer actual black characters who were black from the start.\n Comment: I always headcanoned them as blasian\n Comment: I honestly think if Mikey as white because he talks in that California surfer accent.\n Comment: ![gif](giphy|kN8P8JcB64fja)\n Comment: When's the boycott?\n Comment: [Cowabunga](https://ibb.co/TWjk1SZ)\n Comment: Shiiiit Big W🔥\n Comment: WE ALL SAW THE CYPHER IN THE ELEVATOR. If that wasn't black magic idk what is.\n Comment: Im an orginal Ninja Turtles fan, and im a black man.. But with how they use to say \"KowaBunga\" and \"Totally Dude\".. They were white!! 😂🤣😂\n Comment: 4 Italian names. Eat pizza all the time. Smart remarks come to them naturally. Yup, that's black dudes.\n Comment: I always thought them to be kinda Blasian coded. This is dope though.\n Comment: I hope this rendition of this classic is legit\n Comment: What comic run does this feature in? I loved reading TMNT as a kid.\n Comment: “Donny I don’t understand why that lady called the cops on us, is there any way she saw through the hologram?”\n Comment: Piccolo is black and Gohan's Dad, I'll die on this hill.\n Comment: So this is an honest question and I hope it doesn't come off any other way..\n\nBut wouldn't this be considered blackface? Like even if it's in a positive light? I know they're mutant turtles and all but have they changed the way they talked in the comics?\n\nI don't remember them talking in AAVE, and adding them \"deciding\" to be Black it just feels like blackface?\n\nI'm Latino, and if they did a similar thing but made them Chicanos instead and talking like they're from the border that's how I'd see it. \n\nAnyway! Comic looks good!\n\nedit: Not sure if my comment went through first time, trying again 😅\n Comment: “Mikey’s in the hizzouse.”\n Comment: A lot of blackwashing.\n Comment: Yo this title is bullshit. NIGGA Turtles?! REALLY?!!!!\n Comment: Erry body blowing it up haha they are using holo-grams to look that way in the tnmt power ranger crossover 🤣. They are green turtles and do not and have not ever had a human form. They are literally \"teen aged mutant ninja turtles\" they mutated from regular turtles not regular teens into the tmnt.  If anything they are italian by name, or japanese by skillset/the creator. But more power too you if you think having them use holo-grams to look like stereo-typical black guys wearing tracksuits and do rags is a move in the right direction.\n\nJust goes to show how many people want to just jump on the band wagon and spin the narrative. And how many people don't even read the comics let alone even understand wtf the backstory is or what's going on.\n Comment: They look fantastic\n Comment: I always assumed they identified as Japanese, but I'm down with them being black too ✊🏽\n Comment: Ralph looks too kind here. I need some anger\n Comment: Raph is EXACTLY how I imagined him looking.\n Comment: Reminds me of how Martian Manhunter often chooses to morph into a black guy in different shows and cartoons. That doesn't make him, or TMNT, actually black though.\n Comment: *Holograms*\n Comment: Why is Mikey bite size lol\n Comment: Even if it was race washing or something nobody could disagree with this one ...\n Comment: My understanding was they were mutated by the same chemicals that caused Matt Murdoch to go blind/become the Daredevil.\n Comment: What issues are these, cuz I need this in the DEI collection, stat.\n Comment: Damn, Donnie have something against Mikey? Why he have to make him sub 5'\n Comment: I'm excited to see how young White men are gonna feel like their childhood is being stolen from them\n Comment: No hate but personally I thought there we're white.\n Comment: More like surfers sorry dudes!\n Comment: sending this to a racist friend for lulz\n Comment: Why do they look like the gang from Its Always Sunny from the episode the Gang Turns Black?\n Comment: Seems like the comic and cartoon verses are different? In the latest show, it’s revealed that they have Splinter’s DNA encoded into them, so their human half is Japanese since they’re his genetic sons.\n Comment: Be real for a second. If you hear someone yelling \"cowabunga!\" I don't think that's who you're picturing. They're gonna be a lot nerdier.\n Comment: If you ever want a good laugh go in YouTube and look up nigga turtles it's hilarious\n Comment: I hate to be the bearer of bad news but the Ninja Turtles don’t have a human form. They are mutated turtles and their human DNA is borrowed from, believe it or not, Daredevil the Marvel Comics character who is very much a white guy. What you’re seeing is the Turtles using holograms to appear human and the holograms just so happen to be black. Technically it’s closer to black face. \n\nThat being said I love this comment section!\n Comment: Despite being mutated from a Japanese dude and speaking like white guys?\n\nDo they keep the same voices?\n Comment: What is ‘canon’ though? In the old TV show Raph drank an anti-ooze potion and turned into a red headed white guy. In the IDW comics they were Japanese boys murdered as children and reincarnated as turtles in a research lab.\nAlso it’s not human forms they’re using image inducers.\n Comment: Can’t turtles be turtles?\n\nOf course not when there is Afro dollars to be made\n Comment: They're turtles and green. Mf turn everything into a race issue these days 🐢\n Comment: nigga turtle's is actually a voice over by itsreal85, about 10 years old now. Still funny go check it out, it's over 10 episodes. YouTube kept taking it down lol https://youtu.be/u-8GuIdTncE\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Black folks been adopting fictional characters as one of us since the beginning of time. They been one of us.\n Comment: I'm just not sure constantly referring to yourselves as 'niggas' is going to have the effect you desire.\n Comment: 🎤 🎧 🔥 Vanilla ice Go Ninja Go Ninja Go  🎵🎶\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R_K6971WmAs\n Comment: This is pretty exciting that it's finally cannon.\n Comment: Is this a recent issue ? This is so dope man - Donnie looks exactly how I would imagine him to look.\n Comment: They were so popular in every fucking neighborhood, regardless of class, color or city, and no one could really explain why all the black and brown kids loved them so much...\n\nNow, honestly, I know it sounds stupid, but it makes sense. Jus goes to show, representation on screen, makes impressions on kids. \n\nWe get it, you're 45 and want historically accurate skin color, set design and wardrobe, for example the fish girl movie, that had every white person over 40 losing their shit over. \n\nBut for the kids, you know the intended audience, it's critical for their development. Especially in a society that rejects them. \n\nThis makes so much fucking sense, and I know grown ass men, who served time for violent offenses that are gonna literally cry when I show them this. \n\nSome people will never understand the feeling that comes over some people when they feel represented, in a positive light. \n\nThis honestly made my day. Thank you for posting this\n Comment: Lmafo that's insane, even making ninja turtles black to get the snowflake fat blue hairs onto it\n Comment: Now we just have to wait for the white man-children to stop coping over fictional characters before we can celebrate this W\n Comment: Now If they can make April O'Neal as the Afro-Latine that She always was.\nWe sorted.\n Comment: Ralph looks too happy and kind. Where's the anger? Where's the rage?\n Comment: They do look Hella dope! Totally busting!\n Comment: Splinter gonna be ocky\n Comment: I feel less weird about them saying 'ninja please' in the movie now.\n Comment: What type of timing they on 🤣\n Comment: This right here for the culture!\n Comment: didnt know they had human forms and that it was canon, damn\n Comment: Cowabizzle my nizzle\n Comment: Makes sense, i always assumed don was black as a kid for some reason\n Comment: What issue is this from?\n Comment: Wu Tang (foot) Clan ain't nothin to funk with.\n Comment: I’d watch the shit outta this movie 🍿\n\n![gif](giphy|l1J9N8zrmYCfSrQFq|downsized)\n Comment: I always thought Donny was the tallest and Ralph the shortest or mid height\n Comment: Was it not obvious?\n Comment: Honestly I'm just surprised it took this long.  I could have sworn they had human forms prior to this, like a temporary anti mutagen or something?\n Comment: This is some pandava brother shit right here.\n Comment: https://youtu.be/uFt13ddqnbs The real nigga turtles\n Comment: Considering how much [Black people like pizza](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4iNPoc-i1Mo), this shouldn’t come as a surprise.\n Comment: Wouldn't this technically be Turtles in blackface because it's a holographic projection?\n Comment: What do you expect. They’re from NY where rats are gang leaders, the love pizza from bodegas, and they like beatin people up. Thats screams NY if nothing else does\n Comment: I've definitely never thought they were black. But this is still pretty cool.\n Comment: I would love for them to incorporate tmnt into the mcu\n Comment: That’s what’s up 👍\n Comment: Seeing how innocent Mikey looks makes the last ronin story that more depressing.\n Comment: Oooooooooooooooooooooh you know the white folk are FUMING at this...LMAO!!!\n Comment: “Them hoes is cheese on a board” - Master Splinter\n Comment: Somehow, Mikey, being super short, both surprised me and seems perfectly fitting for him. I love the way they drew all four of them though. I think it’s absolutely perfect for both how they look as turtles and their personalities.\n Comment: Human Rafhael is the best human.\n\nThis is perfection humanified\n Comment: This makes me happy.\n Comment: Wow! They look just like me! I like them now :D\n Comment: The nigga turtles I know was totally different lmao. Top tier dub of the 90s movies\n Comment: Saw this yesterday and I think it's a pretty cool writing and art choice. I love that Donnie made sure they all stayed color coordinated too\n Comment: I've always seen them as Italians or Romans because of their names lol\n Comment: 😭\n Comment: I been black a long time and can say \"Cowabunga\" is not in the lexicon.\n Comment: They don't have a human form, though. Those are disguises.\n Comment: Oh you know Donny spent like three extra hours programming it just right.\n Comment: He's got the best tech\n Comment: They all have backpacks too, emulates them having big shells on their back.\n\nGreat design all around.\n Comment: Rafael - Black AF1s.\n\nDonatello - Ultraboosts \n\nLeonardo - One of the modern Jordans that is actually meant to be played and worked out in. \n\nMikey - The latest super-hyped sneaker that he ninja swiped from a reseller.\n Comment: >Raph got black af1s for sure\n\n100% facts\n Comment: I thought the patch was their Name (Ralph’s has an R), but I’m not as familiar with the Milestone logo.\n\nEdit: autocorrect made it Ralph, but I’m keeping it, just to piss him off.\n Comment: Donnie either got crocs or Jordan 1s on\n Comment: Raph looks like a grown up version of Static Shock.\n Comment: I'm white and I am totally lost here. What the fuck is going on? Are the TMNT re-imagined as black kids here or what's happening?\n Comment: It's not so much a human form but a hologram image to blend in with society. With that said, they chose black over any other option.\n Comment: From the context clues I’m getting in the image; they don’t, those are holograms. But its cool they *choose* to be black.\n Comment: Weren't they like.... turtles....\n Comment: \"Now that we have human forms, we'll no longer have to worry about discrimination and prejudice!

Is this fucking \"Pizza Time\"?\n Comment: I believe it depends on the particular comic run or show.\n Comment: My head always produces the turtles from the first movie, so this Raphael has still developed a heavy Brooklyn accent at some point\n Comment: Rise of the TMNT which I think is the best cartoon version has them different sizes like this.\n Comment: I rememeber in the behind the scenes for the live action, one of the turtle actors was smaller than the rest, but when they cgi'd him, they made him taller and the same size as the others\n\nI guess it depends on the canon?\n Comment: Hahaha this comment made me giggle. A white guy pretending to be black, so he can can get excited about representation online is hilarious.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: jacob from abbott\n Comment: Digital blackface\n Comment: lmao op? quick look at his post history idk maybe he's one of the 3 black toronto hockey fans out there\n Comment: That’s an Atlanta episode within itself\n Comment: nah he used the n word, that's scientifically impossible\n Comment: Now why would you... *rereads title*\n\nOh. (Moves his white ass along)\n Comment: 100%\n Comment: What is wrong with someone wanting representation of a group they are not part of?\n Comment: He's black\n\nAlso let people enjoy shit\n Comment: classic stereotype\n Comment: Raph with the big “i’m walkin here” energy\n Comment: Their slang is. The only one who actually acts like one is Mikey, though, so I'm betting it came from him\n Comment: They are more than likely going to represent the current times. Originally, yeah, they would have been white skater types. New York has obviously changed over time so this is more representative. In the end they are just Turtles so they are whoever you want them to be.\n Comment: That was only during the '90s cartoon era which admittedly is the one most millennials are familiar with. They all have different personalities, but stick to the same general ideas\n\nLeo: classical hero, leader, unsure of himself\nDonny: smart, nervous, awkward.\nRaph: NYC/NJ/Massholetough guy, anger issues, wolverine archetype\nMikey: youngest, lazy, party animal\n Comment: No, that's just the cartoon. They'd probably all be Japanese-American. Leo is a straight up samurai.\n Comment: Funny main character in 90s show? That voice was its own thing.\n Comment: Those videos still crack me up. Gonna go rewatch now.\n Comment: Ehyyyyaa\n Comment: Another fun fact: McDuffie and Keagan Michael Key were long-lost half-brothers though Key didn't know until after McDuffie's passing. \n\nOne wonders at the awesomeness they could've done together (and I focus on that more because Sorkin's a pretentious tool).\n Comment: Someone else commented that the patch on mike’s backpack looks like Milestone logo.\n Comment: McDuffie's old website was so good with lots of great comic and TV insights. I remember he did this whole thing charting how so many shows existed in the same universe tracking all of the spin offs and guest appearances. He wrote so many great stories, and he's one of the few people I was sad to see gone because of it.\n Comment: I remember that!  Sorkin's flailing and pouting was top tier comedy.  Not like his shows.\n Comment: They got a milestone patch so probably\n Comment: Right? I'm ready for the term to die off already.\n Comment: I agree, I wish some black people would let the word die. It’s not empowering to use it. It’s a outdated word from a bygone era. Just cause the turtles are  black doesn’t make them n*ggas. \n\nAnd I totally understand the context. I don’t think the OP is meant to be derogatory, but it’s so normalized in some peoples speech, and in my opinion it shouldn’t be.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I don’t take issue to it, but it seems so…forced, almost? Like we need to fill a quota as black folk to say “nigga” every other post/tweet/comment/whatever.\n Comment: I thought OP was referencing \"Nigga Turtles\"? Funny dubbed videos made by a dude named ITSREAL85.\n Comment: In the newer shows and movies he’s the smallest ‘youngest’ turtle with Raph being the most muscular and Donnie being tall and thin and Leo being average.\n Comment: I don't think he knew that either\n Comment: c'mon, he was born to be the youngest child short king\n Comment: Nah man idk, we claiming Beast Boy? Catchin Villains gave him an invite to the cookout but iono if he one of us lol\n Comment: Brainiac too?\n Comment: I wouldnt call piccolo black because We know how black people are presented in DB and its... not good.\n Comment: Piccolo definitely gave off token black character vibes but I felt like the Saiyans were kin with the whole “monkey” thing and hair that stands up on end.\n Comment: It's from the Power Rangers/TMNT crossover comic, series #2.\n Comment: And freakin' Elmo voiced Splinter in the original movie.\n Comment: Knuckles from sonic is definitely black\n Comment: You reminded me of a paper I read once that talked about how compared to other cartoons in the early nineties, Ninja Turtles appealed to a broader audience because it was one of the only superhero cartoons of the time without a stereotypical white He-Man or GI Joe character. \n\nApril was interesting from a representation perspective too because she was a professional journalist who stood up to the men in her life and was more often an ally to the turtles than she ever was a damsel to be rescued (though that definitely still happened). \n\nI also remember the paper talking about how the vernacular the Turtles used didn't sound like typical heroes of that time, but that the Brooklyn accent and even the surfer speak from Mikey was from BIPOC communities. So whether consciously or not, the Turtles have always been the heroes of the people.\n\nI remember the vernacular stuff in particular because that's when I realized that surfer speak, despite the Cali bro imagery it conjured for me, was appropriated by white dudes. Cuz of course it was\n Comment: As someone who never really gave it much thought, this made me pause, cause if I had been asked to ‘pick’ I probably would have said the same tbh, I wonder why\n Comment: I do believe the mutegen did mix them with splinters human DNA (if I'm not mistaken on how the mutegen works)\n Comment: Yeah, I mean they practise Asian martial arts.\n\nSo could have made at least one of them Asian for representation’s sake.\n\nOtherwise, this is just another non-Asians doing things from Asian culture without any Asian representation.\n\nAnd yes, I know these are just holograms and they are actually turtles, but from a representation point of view, it’s still the same thing.\n Comment: Raph usually has an Italian-Brooklyn accent.\n Comment: Surfer slang makes me think of white dudes too, but turns out it was appropriated from brown people\n Comment: Pizza Tiiimmee\n Comment: https://imgur.com/yPKF64K\n Comment: Nigga… LMFAO\n Comment: Hahaha holy shit\n Comment: ![gif](giphy|3oEjHI8WJv4x6UPDB6)\n Comment: Also the Go Ninja dance. I mean massive fuckin L with using Vanilla Ice instead of…… any other rapper at the time, but that didn’t stop our boys from going off.\n Comment: I don't think certain people care whether they identified culturally with black or white people, to some people it's about sending a message. Personally I don't care as long as there is genuine reason to believe the characters see themselves as black, but I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out it's manufactured. They turned April black already even though she was white.\n Comment: Isn't that just New York?\n Comment: Sounds more like Italians\n Comment: Don’t forget have to live underground because everyone runs away when they see them.\n Comment: And I'm pretty sure at least one or two of them talk like surfer dudes and say stuff like 'gnarly' and 'cowabunga' all the time.\n Comment: Issue #5 from TMNT/Power Rangers II. It came out yesterday.\n Comment: Are you referring to the OP image when you say they're using AAVE?  Because I feel like \"hella dope\" is kinda just the way a boomer writer might imagine young people talking regardless of race.\n Comment: Hmmm, so thinking about this, I guess I'd have to say no simply because it makes me think of X-men Evolution. In that series Kurt (Nightcrawler), who naturally has blue skin, was given some tech to make a hologram around him to make him appear \"normal\" and as a white teen. Basically the same thing as above. \n\nI had no problem with that, so I see no problem with this.\n Comment: Depending on the author, but typically Human Splinter cut himself on the broken vial of mutagen he found in the sewer. That put his DNA into the mutagen but also infected himself. The turtles ate the affected mutagen, mutating their turtle DNA with Splinter's human DNA. Meanwhile, Splinter ate rats to survive and this caused him to mutate with the rat DNA. So if you want to get super technical about it, the 4 brothers are part turtle, part Japanese human. They really are essentially Splinter's biological offspring. Their personalities are like that of an immigrant's children raised in Japanese tradition but influenced by American pop culture seen on television.\n\nYes I'm a huge nerd.\n Comment: Don't be racist pos\n Comment: I dunno, how could they possibly argue that the streetwise teen crimefighters living in downtown NYC are... all white?  Like that has to be a mixed group, right?\n Comment: Realize you getting downvoted for a reason\n Comment: three extra hours?

These are the forms this group of crimefighters chose to take, based on their associations, neighborhood, the people they're fighting for and against, the way they've been treated by the society around them.\n\nI could be whiteguilting too hard, but it seems like if this was a pandering or hailcorporate play, they'd have like one turtle from each race.  The choice to be all-black appears to be deliberate for the characters' development.\n Comment: The skateboarding, the lingo, the dancing, the music... As a white guy I think it makes perfect sense the brothers are BROTHERS. \nAlso April O'Neil is (was?) black and she's the coolest most respected person they know. \nBlack makes perfect sense imho.\n Comment: Apparently they can now make holograms of themselves as humans to blend in, and those holograms are black people.\n\nBut yeah, they were originally turtles.\n Comment: Depends. In some iterations anything imbued with mutagen is mutated based on the last thing they touched. A cat that touches a bird becomes a bird cat. A man who touches a fish becomes a fish man. The turtles were held by Splinter in his human form before the ooze accident, hence they became human turtles. I guess that would make the human side of the turtles East Asian in this particular canon.\n\nIn other iterations the turtles are purely mutated turtles. Since they're not humans, they have no race tied to them in this canon.\n Comment: 🤣\n Comment: Masterpiece\n Comment: “Wanna get fucked up?”\n\n“Yup”\n\n“Got some weed?”\n\n“That purple shit”\n\nPerfect delivery, I just about shit myself\n Comment: Same. I have a shirt that says “these hoes is just cheese on a board”\n Comment: That's cool. Makes them more individual\n Comment: That first movie was the best developed and most realistic looking version of TMNT we’ve ever got.\n Comment: You said the live action and cgi in the same sentence and then realized there are people that don’t default to the costume ones from the 90s as the live action ones and it made my head spin a little.\n Comment: As a white guy trying to get my black friends to read comics as a kid is what got me considering \"defaultism\"  as an aspect of systemic racism.\n\nWhy should so many superheroes be white dudes?\n\nHalf of people in the US are women, ~10% of people in the US were black, why were 95%+ of human superheroes in comics white dudes.\n\nTMNT was a lot more accessible because of that than a lot of other comics.\n\nI remember my buddy Gerald being so fucking stoked when he found Afro Samurai, then a few years later the animated show came out.\n Comment: The caption for this post isn’t one of excitement. That’s from the original post from twitter.\n Comment: It happens\n Comment: oh. well what’d it look like?\n Comment: “Black?!” Actually, it’s Zack!\n Comment: OPs title is the issue.\n Comment: True.

It's more likely that the generation after (and partially including) Gen Z starts just allowing white people to say it than it is that we all just stop saying it.\n\n... To be clear, neither situation is likely; one's just more likely.\n Comment: Yo, I start to flinch, as I try not to say it/But my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it\n\nOn one hand, I agree, but on the other hand, black folk stopping using it won't make a difference to racist white folk who will continue to weaponize the word\n Comment: Bruh its never gonna die out, its possibly the most well known slur. 6th grades say it.

Just cause Namekians are lighter skinned than popo, doesnt make them any less melaninated\n Comment: And Principal Lewis voiced him in the 2012 series.\n Comment: I get what you mean, but it’s worth noting TMNT has always had Asian representation, through Splinter and Shredder. \n\nShredder is always a Japanese guy named Oroku Saki, and Splinter is always a rat owned by a Japanese martial artist named Hamato Yoshi, Yoshi himself after being mutated, or a reincarnation of Yoshi from the feudal period. \n\nIn the comic where there’s reincarnation (IDW) the turtles are also reincarnations of Yoshi’s children so they are Japanese there and we do see their human forms when Yoshi is looking back into his memories while retelling his story of who Saki/Shredder is.\n Comment: Is this a racial trait? Or a SoCal trait?\n Comment: Hella dope is just cali\n Comment: Yeah, I thought the first bubble was worded differently 😅 I guess I didn't consider that maybe teenagers might talk like that nowadays even if only to Boomers. 🤷\n Comment: Then again, Nightcrawler is of German ancestry and would presumably be white without his mutation anyways\n Comment: They didn't say all white people. Only the babies who cry over shit like this. Grow the fuck up if the Ninja Turtles using black hologram avatars makes you angry. That you take it as an attack on all white people is telling.\n Comment: How am I being racist??? I'm just pointing out that there are some fans who are going to react very negatively to this news because TMNT has \"gone woke\" or some other buzzword that gets their neurones firing.\n Comment: I've seen these types of fans literally have a meltdown over the fact that Darwin from Gumball was confirmed to be black or even to link it back to TMMT, cope and seeth over April being black in the new movie and Rise of the TMNT\n Comment: That's a fact, Jack\n Comment: Winterized 1s too. They cant all be smooth.\n Comment: Raphael wears timbs for sure.\n Comment: Facts, they’re swagger was too vibrant if you catch my drift . Since a youth, I’ve known they was black.

Not just any Mickey Mouse but the king of the Stuart little’s.\n Comment: That's for Casey\n Comment: Lmaooo I was like \"okay these make sense\" but then you shut it all down. 100% all timbs and we know it.

Especially if you can choose lol\n Comment: ![gif](giphy|kqCgujDZT1SO4)\n Comment: Broooo 🤣🤣\n Comment: I think they want to look like brothers, brothers as in siblings.\n Comment: I would of definitely expected them to be all different races if the goal was to be more inclusive and diverse. I would of probably went Ralph asian, Leo white, Donnie black, Mikey latin to try to subvert a few stereotypes. I hope the choice to make them all black plays into their storyline and character development.\n Comment: It's really just how pandering has evolved in the past 5-8 years, I think. I've seen a lot more plants these days that go with picking one ethnicity and making that the focus, probably because the approach you're talking about has become pretty transparent and having an all-black or all-asian cast doesn't turn away white viewers like it used to, but it still is a reliable bait for viewers of the respective ethnicity.\n Comment: April O’neils black now. I haven’t kept up with TMNT but back in the late 90’s, early aughts she was white.\n Comment: She was definitely white for a long time before they changed her to be black.\n Comment: They were originally turtles...\n\nThey still are, but they used to be too.\n Comment: Wait but...Splinter ALSO didn't have a human form. The origin I'm familiar with had him as either the pet rat or just a rat living in the dojo of the martial artist Shredder killed. The rat learned his style through years of observation and then the mutagen gave him a body to carry on the style.\n\nIs any of that still canon?\n Comment: I need one. It speaks to me on a deep level\n Comment: [\"Rise\"](https://www.nick.com/shows/rise-of-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles) clearly took a number of inspired takes of the characters. \n\nAlso, the video games usually take the same liberties, gameplay-wise like Mikey being the fastest yet frailest, Donatello having the furthest reach yet moving the slowest, Raph' hitting hard and fast yet also frail and Leonardo being the all-rounder.\n Comment: >As a white guy trying to get my black friends to read comics as a kid is what got me considering \"defaultism\" as an aspect of systemic racism. \n\nSpecifically the mentality that a character needs a \"reason\" to be not a straight white dude and said \"reason\" is that they have to be *defined* by their Otherness and can't be seen as \"normal,\" \"nuanced\" or even \"relatable\" to the general audience. \n\nThis is the pain-in-the-ass double-standard that white actors can play minority roles (ex. \"Gods of Egypt\") with ZERO internal logic as to why yet when something like \"Thor\" comes along that *does* have an internal logic to it and/or completely original characters like Finn in \"Star Wars\", there's a bunch of bullshit since pop culture (and culture in general) has been centered on the same straight white guys since it's made by and for the same demographic. Except *financially,* you can't solely focus on said group at everyone else's expense and make bank at the same time. \n\n\n>TMNT was a lot more accessible because of that than a lot of other comics. \n\nAnd I grew *up* on the '87 cartoon onwards (VHS tapes, toys, stuffed Raphael, an inflatable chair with the staples sticking out that it's a wonder I didn't get tetanus or something, etc.) so trivia like Shredder being voiced by Uncle Phil or how Rob Paulsen voiced Raphael in the '80s then Donatello in 2012 with Pat Musick and her daughter, Mae Whitman voicing his love interests never ceases to amuse me. \n\n\n>I remember my buddy Gerald being so fucking stoked when he found Afro Samurai, then a few years later the animated show came out. \n\nI bought the \"Anime Insider\" magazine *on-sight* simply because of seeing Afro Samurai on the cover and the anime was nice in a superficial, popcorn sense, but nothing deeper like you'd expect about the settings or lore.\n Comment: >\\~10% of people in the US were black\n\nand what percent of them live in the types of neighborhoods you'd need \"crimefighers\" in? The suburbs don't need a Batman. The Upper-east side doesn't need a Superman.\n\nIf anything, a \"rational\" superhero pantheon would be mostly racial minorities defending the communities the mainstream won't protect.\n\nI'm not even going to go into the concept that Batman, as a billionaire, is part of the system of inequality that creates much of the crime in Gotham. Every billionaire is absolutely a failure of public policy, Batman included. That said, I would love to see an interpretation of this where Batman is just the insane side of Wayne and one side fights the crime the other persona creates in this spiral of madness, but I imagine that's far too woke for the demographic seeking basic \"good guy vs bad guy\" morality tales.\n Comment: > Why should so many superheroes be white dudes?\n\nThey’re white because the original target audiences were the boys of affluent Americans. Representation matters, and that’s true at all stages of something’s growth. They target young white boys who grew into white men and shared their boyhood things with their sons. This had a reciprocal effect of growing an audience of mostly young white men, because again respresentation matters. Self feedback loops form, women in comics are treated as objects, and it’s taking a long time before we get to a place socially where we can talk about it. \n\nBecause the comics are being used shifted to a new medium, movies, and that medium needs to be broad to succeed financially, we’re seeing a correction towards forced diversity to inject some elements of representation where they didn’t exist. Affirmative action in a fictional universe.\n\nWhich leads us to the “what’s next”: moving from diverse design to inclusive design. What’s that? It’s where we don’t have to account for exceptions because everything fits. When we see four turtles that are all black because they’re brothers, not a colorful squad designed to appeal to each cross segment of the audience, we see a choice that’s made for the characters themselves. It’s inclusive because it exists in a universe that is itself diverse by nature without needing an excuse or rule to allow it. Its normalized. It’s awesome.\n Comment: An optimistic answer is simply that the white superheroes are more established due to when they were made, and *in general* it's more difficult for new superheroes to stand out against these big juggernauts.\n\nIt's not impossible, but it is more *difficult.*\n Comment: Supposedly it’s one of the big appeals of spiderman.\n\nFull body suit = Any kid could look just like him. Regardless of race.\n\nMeanwhile there’s me. Who wanted to dress up as Superman as a kid, but didn’t cause even I knew people would laugh at me for not being white.\n Comment: I still remember people getting hyped AF for Static\n Comment: I always read comics but couldn't read the Black characters. \n\n\"Hold up. The dude we get is...he's fucking...police proof? Cops can't shoot him? He's walking kevlar?\" \n\nStorm was dope, but she is/was African as is Black Panther (there's a whole diaspora thing there), and then you've got like boring ass Cyborg and that bootleg Superman for a minute. John what'shisname was okay as a Green Lantern. Shit you mean to tell me like nooooobody in the fucking Nova Corp got any sun? \n\nI always Lowkey counted Wolverine as one of us, and Hulk transformed. I don't know how to explain it considering they're clearly white dudes...but it's canon. \n\nOh, and the Osbornes. They can't not draw them wavey af, so we get to claim those two.\n Comment: >\tAs a white guy trying to get my black friends to read comics as a kid is what got me considering “defaultism”  as an aspect of systemic racism.\n\n\nI dont get it.\n\nI’m not white but Neither I nor my friends had any trouble reading or watching white super heroes. \n\nWhy does it matter so much? Do I need to love in a country where I’m a minority to understand this?\n\nAfaik DBZ is wildly popular with black people in The US. Why is that one different?\n Comment: >Half of people in the US are women, ~10% of people in the US were black, why were 95%+ of human superheroes in comics white dudes.\n\nFolklore is usually reflective of the author and the author's experiences. A gold age writer probably didn't see many female or minority \"heroes\"-- police officers, firefighters, EMTs and military.\n\nPlus, if I'm writing a story about a Cold War era super spy, I doubt the CIA would send an out black female lesbian to infiltrate the Kremlin, if they even had an agent like that in the first place.\n Comment: 27% of superheroes are female. Your math doesn't add up.\n Comment: Gotcha, I misunderstood.\n Comment: Black\n Comment: Yikes I missed that!\n Comment: OP is black though\n Comment: Donny has a lot more humility. He isn't perfect all the time.

At least trouble ignores the invisible.\n Comment: truly the ninja way\n Comment: >Im a middle-aged white dude\n\nSo is 80% of this sub.\n Comment: Bro I can’t even read your comment 💀💀🤣😂\n Comment: What middle-aged person, regardless of race of ethnicity, is not invisible? Our culture dismisses the aged, parents, elderly, etc. Other people who reach middle age have similar experiences, not just white men.\n\nI'm not even going to go into how women go 100% invisible when they even get close to middle-aged, and women actors can't even get roles while middle-aged white men become box office stars. Middle aged white men are far from invisible. In fact they're often the most powerful demographic in the US from a social, economic, and political aspect. If there's an issue that affects white men, society will know about it and must address it, no matter how ridiculous and ignorant.\n\nEven the ones in Honda Civics have privilege because they benefit from policies other powerful white men have put into place for their benefit.\n Comment: Ha same. I was riding around in it with my stoner looking friend who drives a beater, and he had so much anxiety when I forgot a blinker on an empty street cause he thought we were gonna get pulled over.\n Comment: Lmao, it’s a differentiator for sure, I’ll say that\n Comment: ![gif](giphy|TNR2EpkHYwW0ifyMDF)\n Comment: Being black in America 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️\n Comment: Yeah but if you’re trying to blend in, being a black teen in America ain’t the top option\n Comment: Everything you said was spot on and then those last two words...\n Comment: Less eyes are better when you’re a walking talking turtle lol\n Comment: Doesn’t NYC have more white people than black people tho? I would imagine being white would still help them fit in unless they go to certain areas\n Comment: Oh, yeah, I didn't think of that.\n Comment: lol\n Comment: Same mama dif daddies\n Comment: Meh we've had so many all white hero teams I think it's fine if we don't tick every diversity checkmark, them being all black is really cool.\n Comment: As traditional as his personality is, I would have figured Leo would be Japanese\n Comment: if it came to stereotypes donnie would be asian or indian since hes the science/engineer guy, ralph would have to be black or latino sinces hes hot headed and gets angry quickly, leonardo would be japanese since hes more stoic, and mikey would be white but dressed like a sakter/rapper with adhd.\n Comment: Leo being white would still be too much as the leader. I would have made Leo Latin. Worked for Xiaolin Showdown.\n Comment: she was originally light skinned black\n Comment: 1st issue she was black with a bitchin' afro. She was made white in the cartoon then whitewashed later iirc.\n Comment: I meant before they were ninja turtles they were just regular turtles, not humans that became ninja turtles.\n Comment: That depends on the iteration. In some versions (most notably the first comics and the first movies), Splinter is a mutated rat and a former pet of the ninja master Hamato Yoshi. In other versions (notably the '87 cartoons), Splinter IS Hamato Yoshi who was mutated into a rat man. Usually, other TMNT stories are based on one of these two archetypes.\n Comment: That's actually genius for fighting games like Brawlhalla or Smash. Add the character and tie their bandana colot to the type/strength or weakness of the version you picked.\n Comment: >I bought the \"Anime Insider\" magazine *on-sight* simply because of seeing Afro Samurai on the cover and the anime was nice in a superficial, popcorn sense, but nothing deeper like you'd expect about the settings or lore.\n\n\nG is now a music historian with a focus on hip hop.\n\nI'm going to crib some of his explanation and I'm gonna do it poorly but still try to share the gist of how he explained it to me.\n\nAfro Samurai was fun, violent, stylish, visceral, and raw.  He described it as ***feeling*** like many of the aspects of Hip Hop, the anime including music from RZA was a core component of bringing it all together in the same way it made Ghost Dog more consistent and authentic.\n\nIn the same way the setting blended high technology with cybernetics and advanced firearms with the feudal setting and swordsmanship, it was a blend of traditional Japanese iconography and tropes with those of the cultural hodgepodge of Black culture that happens when you have your national culture stripped away.\n\nI get if it's not your thing, but it meant a lot to him, and if you rewatch it more critically you may get something more out of it.\n Comment: >\"Gods of Egypt\"\n\nWow. 15% at Rotten Tomatoes is a...feat. And the few good reviews I saw were more about \"this was so bad, it was good\" type sentiment.\n Comment: The irony here too of course is that it’s the fact that non cis het white male characters needs justifications and reasons to deviate is one of the reasons why you can’t just “raceblind” cast them for adaptations despite disingenuous cries to do so.\n Comment: The internal logic is Jake Gyllenhal or whatever was a huge name (I know it's a different move) and this is more about the money that his name makes than anything regarding story logic.  The money is real, the story is not.  In the past there certainly was racism which you could reason was the whole reason, but most actors were white, and colored folk weren't treated very well in the industry as a whole.  Even then having John Wayne play Genghis Kahn was probably a mixture of \"we need a name for this\" in addition to \"we need an actor\".  And there weren't many asian actors to fill that role, while Wayne would also bring more people to the theater as well as know how to film and lead a movie.  Not many people knew how to do that. \n\nI understand the initial comments about Finn being a black storm trooper... just in \"what does that mean?\".  It had to mean something, conscription or even not being clones, for storm troopers were never clarified in the originals, and then in the prequels they made them all clones.  When you get a layer deeper you understand that the Empire is xenophobic and bigoted as hell, so, a black storm trooper raises some questions.  I don't think that line of questioning was racist.  I'm not on twitter, which is where I think most of the racism was, so I didn't really see it, I just talked to star wars nerds about it and we discussed the implications....  What they did with the character in later films was a shame though. \n\nI think what annoyed me about recent Star Wars movies is how much they are putting female leads in there saying they are groundbreaking without realizing Princess Leia is the only reason anything actually happened in Star Wars.  She saves everyone's life multiple times, and basically runs the show (while being a smoke show).  Luke and Han would be fucking smoked without the Princess, multiple times over.  She's the real hero.\n Comment: 100% right.\n\n\nBATMAN: WHITE KNIGHT actually delves into those themes a bit. It's about how Joker and Batman's everlasting feud is destroying Gotham.\n\nOne small aspect is how other billionaires are buying up property destroyed by Batman driving out the original inhabitants and flipping it gentrifying those areas.\n\nIt's wild and a good book if you like exploring what some more realistic consequences of Batman's psychotic vigilantism would cause IRL.\n Comment: In recent Batman comics they actually started to address how Bruce Wayne could actually do more systemic changes to help more people than Batman ever could hope to do just by punching dudes in the face.\n Comment: Yeah like this is the history of those comics. A lot of them were made by Jewish guys in the 30s who also lived in the hood back then. Like Hells Kitchen was legit the hood hood. Like watching old timey movies like Angels With Dirty Faces (one of the inspos for Creed III) you see some of the same shit said about the Irish that you see said about the hood today\n Comment: Batman is a 100-year-old media franchise. Everything you said has already been explored in the comics so much that people are asking for regular good vs bad adventure stories with the Bat-family. The comics folks are tired of Batman fighting mentally ill people since the 80s.\n Comment: Except that's not true though. The audiences were poor white Jewish boys in the slums. That changed in post WWII America however\n Comment: Not gonna lie, when the Spiderman came out in 2011 where Miles Morales became Spidey,  that news travelled fast, I consistently had several new black kids a day coming in looking at comics when before I just had the same 2 or 3 coming in consistently, not all of them became consistent customers but the demographics of my store changed immediately.\n Comment: Bishop had mostly side action, and I guess not being down with Jon Stewart is what it is.\n\nI did like Steel's story better than all the other  replacement superman's.\n\nBut Blade and Spawn were fucking awesome.\n\nEspecially Spawn.\n Comment: Because Piccolo is black? j/k\n Comment: > Why does it matter so much\n\nThe US is obsessed with identity politics\n Comment: You’re good. I had to clarify\n Comment: Ralph: Fuck the turtle babies. This bitch done told *gestures heatedly* everybody in the city\n Comment: The Jewish delegation would like to stake its claim to Yoda and Kermit. Not saying they ain't black, but they're definitely also members of the tribe.\n\nWe're willing to relinquish Yoda in return for full custody of Kermit, so long as we keep the Mel Brooks parody version from Spaceballs.\n Comment: I would like to add Oscar the Grouch, the green M&M and the Hulk. Bruce Banner ain't, but Hulk is\n Comment: Killer Corc too\n Comment: So if skeeter was black, what was Roger?\n Comment: Wtf kind of list is that?\n Comment: Also Jar Jar Binks\n Comment: Even persecuted by the white version of his species.\n Comment: Gimme a break!\n Comment: bart simpson used to say it all the time.\n Comment: I’m from California my boy, in the early 90’s we said lots of things\n Comment: That was my immediate thought that made me doubt 😂😂😂😂\n Comment: Cowabunga*\n Comment: Casey’s white, not 40.

We're invisible to even cops, as they often won't bother with mid-range nice cars knowing that they often send attorney representation to court to challenge any tickets and typically won't have drug possession. \n\nEven among white people, cops will target speeding sport cars and poor cars, but usually let the mid-range nice cars cruise by (so long as you're not driving recklessly). \n\nPeak invisibility.\n Comment: I def prefer being invisible\n Comment: Strike hard and fade away without a trace\n Comment: Invisible in the context of avoiding scrutiny. Not invisible in the context of employment, receiving service, etc. Man's acknowledging his privilege.\n Comment: Totally agree! I think he was just talking about being able to blend into the background so well he isn't profiled by law enforcement/society like he might be if he were a different race- even more so if he were younger. But I'm not positive.\n Comment: Invisible? You can literally bump into a middle age woman and not notice they are so forgotten by society.\n Comment: Buddy, I have something to tell you about black people, and minorities in cities.\n\nIt's almost like they live in them in a more concentrated amount!\n Comment: NYC isn't all of America\n Comment: From last I've known, New York has a bad habit of police brutality against minorities.\n\nIf the TMNT was worried about cops, they would know way beforehand how cops treat the minorities of the bungalows THEY STAY UNDER. The minorities that fill the gangs they fight. The minorities that make the pizzas they eat and so on.\n\n\nIf avoiding cops was the main reason for their disguises, they would probably be white.\nHowever, it is more important to blend in with the locals, even if the locals have a police brutality issue.\n\nWhy would ninjas need to worry about the authority of a world that isn't able to keep up with them?\n Comment: And how better to get less eyes on you, than being a minority in New York? Bruh, you buggin.\n Comment: Every place in America has more white people in it, so yeah, I'd assume one of the places we take in immigrants is even more influx with them.\nHowever, black people are kind of a staple of cities, especially New York. I really shouldn't have to explain that.\n Comment: Lmao\n Comment: There are people who see the lack of white people in any form of media as an attack on white people, despite the fact that so much media up to this point has been entirely white or entirely white minus one character.\n Comment: Yeah, probably would be but my goal was to subvert some stereotypes so I thought “hey, how about a white guy who a good leader, but actually sees his team of POCs as equals/brothers and have compassion and care for them”.\n Comment: Yeah exactly, thats why I stated them in the order I did; to subvert those stereotypes. Make them the opposite of how society often stereotypes them.\n Comment: That was just a common 80s hair doo at the time and it was a black and white comic.  When the comic was colored, she was white.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EricDJuly/status/1632841826875973633\n Comment: Nope she was definitely white then too.\n Comment: Before they were teenage mutant ninja turtles they were adolescent mutant ninja turtles.\n Comment: Dope, thanks for the clarification. I'm not sure if I prefer the \"Mutagen Just Makes You Into A Random Furry\" approach, tbh. The idea that it hyper-evolves animals until they're humanlike was fun, and allowed them to retain their animal qualities.\n\nBut this is all good to know, and thanks again for sharing.\n Comment: First time I saw ghost dog, it was on DVD and somehow defaulted to the \"music only\" mode. I was so confused, but liked it anyway.\n Comment: As I said, I *enjoyed* it on a superficial level, but felt underwhelmed on the world-building level, especially as the franchise's \"gimmick\" is to slightly change things depending on the medium.\n Comment: For a movie with as much crazy vfx as it had it STILL felt boring, and I admittedly like bad CGI movies.\n Comment: I liked that movie, but it's entirely because it's just so dumb, low stress, and impossible to take very seriously\n Comment: One of the critiques was that the movie didn't even *know* whether it wanted to take itself seriously or not. \n\nAlso, the \"star power\" excuse for this movie was bullshit as well given it's biggest star was Gerard Butler whose star power at the time wasn't exactly fresh off of \"300\". \n\nThis and \"Pan\" were both hyped to be the next big franchises before the box office said otherwise.\n Comment: >The internal logic is Jake Gyllenhal or whatever was a huge name (I know it's a different move) and this is more about the money that his name makes than anything regarding story logic. \n\nI *know,* (and like everyone else, have heard the excuse for years,) but clearly *the money. wasn't. there.* \n\n\nThe last whitewashed movie to make bank despite the controversy was the first \"Doctor Strange\" movie. Everything afterwards (and many before) BOMBED with \"Ghost in the Shell\" finally killing the claim as the target demo DID NOT turn out enough to make the movies geared towards them actually profitable. \n\n>It had to mean something, conscription or even not being clones, for storm troopers were never clarified in the originals, and then in the prequels they made them all clones. \n\nBesides the fact that the *movie, itself* states the First Order was kidnapping children out of desperation, SW fanboys are THE MOST dedicated to the lore to know/expect such a thing. Specifically that the clones had *been* phased out and replaced with regular joes that joined up. \n\nThis isn't touching on the same \"But the source material\" claim in other IPs where so-called purists claimed Rue and Thresh were \"turned\" Black in the movies when they were Black in the movies because they're *Black in the books* (especially as their district was an allegorical *slave plantation* down to Thresh's association with the fields of wheat like a field slave.) Not to mention how so-called purists didn't mind that Katniss, herself was Ambiguously Brown in the books (there's supposed to be a distinct difference between Capitol people and Katniss's district that her younger sister \"passes\" for Capitol-descent as their mother is from there but Katniss looks \"local\") yet played by the very Unambiguously White Jennifer Lawrence with the casting call being exclusively for white girls. Those white fans made it obnoxiously clear that Rue lost all value and innocence as soon as they learned she was a Black girl *like* Prim in age and personality instead of appearance. 😒\n\n>When you get a layer deeper you understand that the Empire is xenophobic and bigoted as hell, \n\nTowards *aliens,* not humans. We've seen since the OT that there were clearly non-white members (ex. that one Black guy on the bridge with the funky 19th Century-type facial hair) as the Empire are Space!Nazis against *non-humans*. Palpatine was racist against *Wookies,* Twi'leks and the like instead of Black or Asian humans, so it was a big deal that Thrawn was part of the Empire, let alone a respected, high-ranking part of it. So even trying to make that excuse to downplay the racism is enabling and willfully ignorant as it is eye-rolling. 😒 \n\nBefore \"The Matrix\" with its \"Redpilled\" male fans, \"Star Wars\" was the OG progressive franchise with an ignorant section of right-wing that COMPLETELY missed the obvious points/themes of said franchise. \n\nOT!Star Wars: A diverse group of young people against Space!Nazis with a White Male Lead. \n\nNew Trilogy!Star Wars: A diverse group of young people against Space!Nazis with a White *Female* Lead. \n\nThe Matrix: A diverse group of people whose heroes are predominantly women and/or people of color (which would've been even more evident had Will Smith taken the role instead of \"Wild Wild West\") while the Agents take the form of conservative-looking white men with very generic names like \"Smith\" and \"Jones\". Additionally the original idea for Switch was being trans who'd be played by a man in the physical world yet female in The Matrix instead of \"just\" an Ambiguously Gay tomboy as there's still palpable amounts of trans allegory. And for Bonus Points, Cypher, (aka \"Mr. Reagan\" as in Ronald Reagan,) the white man who sells out the original crew for his own personal gain, is basically every ostensibly ally that realized how hard social activism is and wants to go back to comfortably blissful ignorance/privilege to the point his deal with the machines is not only to be reinserted into the Matrix with his memories wiped, but to be \"somebody like a movie star or politician\". \n\n\nThe saying, \"When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression\" very much applies in pop culture.\n Comment: I also think, and this is generous, that the Batman 1989 movie wanted to make a seriously mentally ill Batman but couldn't quite do it, I imagine because it would upset fans. I think there was a theme that Wayne's evening adventures were actually irrational, dangerous, and part of a system of oppression. The other characters like the police, mayor, and reporters comment on this constantly. Alfred openly disapproved and told him to stop. Keaton played Wayne as extremely eccentric, troubled, dissociated, and borderline confused in every scene. Batman himself is presented as violent, emotionally stunted, and often aimless and just picking fights. Wayne is damaged by the deaths of his parents and just wants to hurt people in some form of revenge.\n\nIts only later that Batman finds purpose when the Joker arrives. Previous to that he was just assaulting petty street criminals. Like breaking legs and spines over stolen candy bars type thing, but none of that is really shown, just implied by the acting, commentary by other characters, and some headlines shown. At the start of the movie, the people were terrified of Batman and the cops wanted to stop him for public safety reasons.\n Comment: That's a good point. I think as comic fans become more educated and older, they have to address more modern perspectives, but for 99.9% of the Batman run, it was seen as \"rich guy = good\" which is troubling.\n\nI also see progress with the new Batman movie. Bruce's dad was shown as pretty corrupt and wealth and power focused which is probably a more realistic view of the fictional Wayne family. Bruce himself is pretty emo/dejected/withdrawn, which pushes the troubling rich guy narrative to his father, which is probably as good as a \"hey... isn't Batman's riches one of the causes of the problems here\" narrative we'll get in film in a while.\n\nI think if they want to sell film tickets, Batman still needs moral superiority and that can't happen with narratives questioning the morality of all the wealth he holds. So we get the dad as the placeholder for the evils of this wealth.\n\nA broke Batman who gave up his riches would be interesting, imho. But a lot of his allure is about being this playboy rich guy and having incredible gadgets, which don't seem possible if he didn't have fame and wealth.\n Comment: Yep. Same out here. Everyone wanted Spidey stuff\n Comment: Shiiiiiiiit Bishop, Spawn, and Blade. I knew I was gonna forget some important dudes. \n\nI loved all of 'em. My bad.

In his free time that dude was rocking Vans.\n Comment: Drugs and living hookers. Way more fun.\n Comment: word to tim allen\n Comment: Live hookers are reusable imo\n Comment: Why they always gotta be dead???\n Comment: In the spirit of transparency, there was once where my minivan got pulled over, but in hindsight it was totally justified.\n\nIt was my wife's best friend's birthday, and we were all totally smashed because of a top shelf open bar. Thinking ahead, I gave my little sister the keys to my minivan (we took a limo) and told her if it looked like we needed a fast out to be ready with the Catapilla to come swoop. We were supposed to stay the night at their hotel suite, but my brother in-law and I got way too hammered, and I called the audible for her to come get us. \n\nWhen she came to get us we were like goofy wild animals, waiting for her at the entrance to the hotel. 4 of us jump in the van, it's 2am, and we are more hyped than ever that we made it back to the safety of the van, because we were in bad shape and the hotel people were sick of us. Turning up the music we started to dance and celebrate, 4 grown men in the back of a minivan dancing. The car was probably visibly rocking, and our hype got the attention of a cop who hit us with the red and blues. We weren't doing anything illegal, we knew that, but we're minorities and it's the south so we stfu. Except my brother in-law, a Marine a few years removed from serving. He insists he can talk our way out of it. Opens up the side door, to our horror, and hops out, hoping to have a word with the officer...\n\n\"GET BACK IN THE CAR, SIR!\"\n\nKind of shocked him right out of that delusion and he did as he was told.\n\nCop comes to the window, calls for his partner because he sees so many of us in the car. They seem super nervous, but we keep cool and answer questions.\n\nMy sister forgot her ID at home 🤦🏽‍♂️ but luckily she had her driver's license number memorized! She told the cops she was picking up her drunk ass brother and friends and was totally sobar. They commended her on the act, and told us to go ahead and get home safe. \n\nWe cheered and cranked up the music like we just won the gaddamn Super Bowl. \n\nAnd into the night we went, we all got home safely.\n\nThe end.\n Comment: One time my mom's white Dodge Caravan got stolen from the parking lot right outside her building. Geniuses never heard the saying do one crime at a time, so when they got pulled over the back was, like, FILLED with guns. \n\nHer solution was to buy The Club. Because really, whatcha gonna do?\n Comment: Every bar is a lesbian bar if you know enough lesbians\n Comment: every bar is a lesbian bar with you in it\n Comment: If you're flammable and have legs you are never truly blocking a fire exit\n Comment: What's your problem?!?\n\n*It's a Simpsons reference, no meant for disrespect\n Comment: It's awesome that they slightly misinterpreted the comment, went on a tirade about white male privilege, was kindly corrected underneath, and is somehow currently sitting at +14 upvotes despite it all. Just about any other sub would've had their ass downvoted into oblivion by now.\n Comment: I live in baltimore so…\n Comment: In New York minorities are white peoples\n Comment: Dpeends which city. Most east coast cities have a lot of black people, so for NYC it still works. In the southwest and midwest a lot of cities dont have that many black people tho\n Comment: Or we could just get Mark Wahlberg to play him like he did in that four brothers movie\n Comment: And then before that they were baby turtles.\n Comment: The fun about the \"whatever you touch\" approach is that things can become hybrids with objects as well. You'll see a person fuse with a car or someone who didn't touch anything just turn into a pile of living mutagen. Still, so long as the properties of mutagen stay open ended, I'm cool with both.\n Comment: Without wealth Batman couldn't exist.\n\nThe education, the physical training, the technology and the network required to be Batman wouldn't be possible without the money.\n\nWealth is neutral. Greed or altruism is the moral quandary.\n Comment: True but also remember unlike comic books, the main characters in Dragonball and DBZ weren't white they were a bunch of Asian characters and some aliens that looked like the Asian characters. I won't presume to argue why that is more acceptable, just noting it.\n Comment: 💀\n Comment: He is the international crotchety old man on his stoop with some dominoes\n Comment: Give me a minute I'm making a list of celebrities who are secretly Hufflepuff.\n Comment: Cowabunga!!!!!\n Comment: PARTYYYYYY!!!!\n Comment: i def missed the \"black\" in that sentence 🤣\n Comment: Bart Simpson is black , he’s just yellow and light skinned . 😂😂😂\n Comment: Where u from ?

He is a weird, terminally unemployed dude who gets his clothes and weapons from weird church stoop sales in Brooklyn. He has absolutely no drip and the only way he'd have brand name shoes is if someone had convinced him that cavemen didn't need podiatrists because *your toes have to move, man, that's why these superstar athletes with million dollar training facilities get all these injuries! Their feet are trapped. You should come to the box and do the WOD tomorrow. I'll vouch for you.*\n Comment: ^ This guy fucks\n Comment: LOL, glad everyone made it home ok.

There's no goddamn major city in America that doesn't have majority white people\n Comment: 😂\n Comment: Wealth is absolutely not neutral.\n Comment: You think db chars look asian?\n\nHave you seen asian people?\n\nMarvel has more asian looking people than 99% of animes lol\n Comment: Lancaster, Altadena, spend some time in the I.E., Barstow, Bakersfield, L.A. hell even had family in Van Nuys.... 80s baby so was a preteen when TMNT came out and bro you're capping..Dudes weren't walking around saying cowabunga.

Just sayin.\n Comment: I don't drink that anymore, and was almost mostly an accident on account of an open bar and being kinda young. \n\nCheers\n Comment: Haha, I know right, it's definitely one of my favorite interactions in the show...not that Homer was appalled he was in a lesbian bar, to the writers credit not a big deal now but back in the nineties not commonplace to see LGBTQ people normalized, but that he was so perceptive about the building\n Comment: Well the parts of New York I’m used to I guess. Brooklyn mostly\n Comment: I’m not lol\n Comment: Wealth is absolutely not not neutral.\n Comment: Yeah.

(That’s how the zoologist recommended we do it). Is that more weird than this?\n Comment: Wtf?! Fascinating.  Never imagined they'd be that deep? How the hell do they get out from underneath all that dirt/weight?\n Comment: Jelly Bean: \"Just five more weeks ...\"\n Comment: I’ve never buried my tortoises, right now I have a big Igloo type doghouse that we fill up with dirt and mulch and we let the tortoises dig in for the winter.  I would be too nervous to just bury them myself. Not sure how I would know they’re ready?  I mean, they slow down and stop eating but I wouldn’t know if they needed another week or so, you know? When they do it themselves…I figure they know what to do.  But they’ve been doing this for years and the tortoises are still alive, so…..cool?\n Comment: You have to leave them down there if you ever want to grow a turtle tree.\n Comment: How the hell do they breathe?\n Comment: Thought for sure she murked those turtles\n Comment: Growing up I found a box turtle alone in the road by my house. When I brought him home our best guess was he escaped from the previous owner’s house. My father built him an outside pen to stay in out of some ply wood. During the fall we would fill the pen to the top with fallen leaves and he would dig his own network of tunnels and borrow. Every year around Easter we would dig him out and feed him cherry tomatoes. I had that turtle for going on 10 years before he sadly passed away. Now every year around spring I still think of the little guy. Never thought to physically bury them. Wonder if that would have been better.\n Comment: Squirtle is 17 years old. \n\nI never thought the catastrophic distance I now am from my childhood could be measured by a Turtle.\n Comment: Squirtle was like “this bitch burried me again 😡”\n Comment: Jellybean is dead lol\n Comment: So what happens if you forget to resurrect them??\n Comment: I had no clue that turtles hibernated.  I would be a terrible turtle dad.\n Comment: Part time pets!\n Comment: \"it's Halloween! Time to dig up the extender family! Our extended family members, Meghan and Ken, have been burried burried in the backyard since Easter, following an argument.\"\n Comment: How do you find them or did you help them choose their spots? How did you get them to imprint with your property and not stray for so years? So many questions.\n Comment: Imagine waking up from a long hibernation and the first thing you get it’s a damn cold shower!! Man life sucks… LOL\n Comment: Welp..now I need a t-shirt with Squirtle and JellyBean asking which personality are you.\n Comment: That’s squirtle turtle murder for shurdle.\n Comment: Huh, I’ve never had to bury mine or dig them up. They just sorted themselves out.\n Comment: Jelly Bean is cracking me up. The end shot where she's STILL in her shell. I'm dying lol\n Comment: Maybe jelly bean is dead\n Comment: Jellybean is my spirit animal!\n Comment: How do they live without pizza for 5 months?\n Comment: I hate this. Too many idiots are going to watch this and try it and kill their turtles.\n Comment: This is stupid. My mom has had box turtles for years in her yard and they dig themselves into corners of the yard and piles of compost she leaves around the yard and they come out in the spring when they are ready to.\n\nAlso you don’t soak a “dehydrated” turtle in a bath. They get their moisture from their food or by drinking\n Comment: WTF!  Leave these turtles alone.  They can handle brumation on their own. No need for influencer intervention and their dumb ass ideas.  Hoping the turtles fight back and push her in the hole.\n Comment: Imagining Kevin from The Office saying, \"But it turns out the turtle was dead all along.\"\n Comment: Squirtle is 17?

Bc I need to follow this! If I have to download tiktok I will!\n Comment: Yea. I love being woken up before my alarm\n Comment: **TIL** you can plant turtles and they grow back the following year\n Comment: I have a buddy who puts his turtles through brumation (that’s what hibernation is for reptiles) by putting them in a mini fridge. Burying them is more natural as they will bury themselves in the wild when temperatures start to drop, but my buddy lives where it can get a little too cold for the turtles in the winter. So sometimes he has turtles in a fridge. They are completely fine when they are in there and slowly wake up when he brings them out.\n\nEven pet reptiles kept in a warm environment will naturally go through a brumation cycle so it’s important to have a way to cool them down for the winter or whenever they start to enter brumation naturally.\n Comment: I can't imagine doing this then forgeting and thinking \"oh fuck I forgot to dig up the turtles again\"\n Comment: How does a turtle possibly get out from that depth without any human intervention? Doesn't seem like a natural way for them to hibernate?\n Comment: Anybody else think jellybean is dead?\n Comment: *2 years later..*\n\n“Jelly Bean is still grumpy and starts to smell weird”\n Comment: How long can a box turtle go without eating?\n Comment: oh my god. i love her. i want her to be friends with my wife. 🤣\n Comment: Is this brumation or hibernation?\n Comment: Jelly bean:  Snooze button, dammit!\n Comment: I found a random turtle in my yard the other day in some dug up dirt. I was really confused because there’s no near by bodies of water that I know of. Was homie chilling underground for the winter?\n Comment: I don’t think this is a good idea. Those were way too deep. They never would have been able to dig them out if this woman had passed away or something.\n Comment: Jellybean woke up the other day after warmer weather. She was…grouchy.\n Comment: TORTOISES.\n Comment: This crazy bitch says it all “let’s go dig up the turtles”.  It’s an animal and lives in the yard, if it wanted to bury itself three feet under your backyard it would.\n Comment: That's insane, and jelly bean is dead\n Comment: same jellybean, same.\n Comment: Nice\n Comment: What would have happened if something had happened to her and they couldn't dig themselves out from there, i wonder\n Comment: How do they not mow over them?\n Comment: Do turtles dig themselves into the earth in the wild?\n Comment: I'm with you Jelly Bean. Don't let them wake you up!\n Comment: Why turtles? Are they not tortoises? I’m sorry, I’m learning English and have been corrected quite a few times by my Teacher and some peers.\n Comment: She makes horse girls seem normal\n Comment: Hello. If we wanna get technical here, this is brumation. Strictly speaking, hibernating is for warm-blooded animals.\n Comment: I never knew they do this…so at first I thought she was being sarcastic. Then she dug up the turtles, fascinating!\n Comment: That's Hella cute 😆 his name is squirtle I love it.\n Comment: She was so overly happy I thought the video was going to end with her cooking them on a BBQ\n Comment: So for 5 months your pet is underground????\n Comment: Dirt nap took a new meaning\n Comment: I find this highly suspicious. No food and no water, close to no oxygen, and 3 feet deep in the ground for months?\n\nThis seems very dubious\n Comment: How did she even find them?\n Comment: Why wouldn't you just leave them to come out when they were ready?\n Comment: This has to be a joke right?\n\nTurtles don't REALLY hibernate like a bunch of potatoes... right?\n Comment: I never knew that turtles do hibernate\n Comment: This bitch scares me.\n Comment: Cruelty to animals.  Turtles like to wander.\n Comment: That one turtle is so dead.\n Comment: Now I want to be a turtle, I'll just dig a hole in the ground and  I'll come out when I feel like it.\n Comment: How do they breathe?\n Comment: When you slept for five months but still need five more minutes\n Comment: That lady's voice is adorable, I need to lie down.\n Comment: Arent these tortoise and not turtle?\n Comment: Bro looking for sea\n Comment: But… why can’t they just dig themselves out and live a natural life and all that? \n\nI’m confused about the purpose of this kind of husbandry…\n Comment: Jelly bean is dead\n Comment: If they don’t have to brumate (reptile hibernation) you shouldn’t do it. There’s no benefit for them brumating vs living indoors for the winter months. Sometimes they go to sleep and don’t wake up. The risks for most reptile owners far outweighs any benefits. \n\nThe only real “benefit” is that brumation is important for the reproductive process. So if you’re breeding reptiles brumation can be necessary. But most people are not breeding so they should skip brumation.\n\nEdit: autocorrect sucks\n Comment: I feel terrible.  I found a baby tiny painted turtleon my walk last monday.  It was on the walking trail and couldve got stepped on.  I was on my break, so i picked it up and put it in my cup holder in my car(enclosed garage, left car windows open so weather was beautiful.  I came back out after work and couldnt find it.  I think there was a very small opening in my cup holder that lead to the inside of my center console.  It mustve got in there and could never find it.  I ripped out the cup holder and loomjed around.  Now i think i have a dead baby tiny turtle in my car\n Comment: I dont know what black magic necromancy the witch is playing at!

Turtles have flippers and live in water. And tortoises do not hibernate. You  are being ridiculous and cruel burying them.\n Comment: She is super cute.\n Comment: As someone who hates to be woken up mid sleep this is really griding my gears.\n\n\nLook at how deep the turtle dig just to be able to sleep quietly! Dude, if it were me I would just bite your nose off, chew it and spit on your face!\n Comment: Crazy woman is burying turtles in her backyard.\n\nIf you aren’t keeping them inside, away from natural predators and winter, you should probably let them actually be free.\n\nI can’t hang out today because I gotta dig out the turtles….wtf???\n Comment: I would totally hit that.  The weirder and nerdier the better.  She’s too cute.\n Comment: Buried? Wtf\n Comment: That's so cool!

Do they really like getting buried?\n Comment: When I die, I want to come back as one of her turtles.\n Comment: I hope Jellybean is doing ok today. I feel her feels.\n Comment: Her voice is… like… so weird to me. It sounds so *default.* Extremely midwestern, too. She’s like pronouncing every singular letter in every word so sharply. Sort of like what “perfect” rhotic English sound like. \n\nNo accent. No tang. No nothing. It is the sharpest, most plain American sounding voice I’ve ever heard in my life.\n Comment: i don’t know what’s stranger, putting them in a box in the fridge or burying them 2 feet in the ground hahah turtles are so cool, man.\n Comment: Jelly bean has my vibes\n Comment: Why the fuck would you have to help them do something they can do on their own?\n Comment: Jellybean is definitely not dead\n Comment: 5 more minutes mom!\n Comment: I dig my turtle out sometimes too\n Comment: What in the whirl?\n Comment: So that’s where my turtle went\n Comment: My biology class pet is a turtle like this and it just hibernated in a log, when she said she was digging up turtles I was thinking she was digging up their graves\n Comment: I would forget where I buried them.\n Comment: 5 more minutes.....\n Comment: Saauce\n Comment: Why are we still doing it *manually*?

I wonder if this motherfucker went and brumated under the deck in the soil.\n Comment: This is so freaking cool. So, question. If they weren’t retrieved without a human nearby, would they be able to make it back up quickly enough to make the “deadline”?

Even reptiles that live indoors can brumate to some degree in the winter months, they can be more lethargic and eat less.\n Comment: Turtle expert weighed in the other day to confirm this is *not* good practice and dumb ass videos like this will inevitably lead to turtle deaths. Buried alive, what a literal nightmare. Remember the facebook hero who ‘rescued’ a tortoise by putting it in a lake?\n Comment: Jellybeans.... Yes. I understand you\n Comment: Ours was a packing box filled with straw in the attic. We took him out when Blue Peter told us to\n Comment: That’s how one of my friends did it. \n\nHad another friends with a larger tortoise who stayed outside all year. He had full run of the side yard… and then after like 10 years they had renovations done and it turned out he dug out part of the foundation to hibernate. Cardboard box seems like a good idea\n Comment: Very slow\n Comment: It would have buried itself in much looser pond/river mud naturally, not under 2 feet of sod and back yard soil.  If she hadn't recovered them, I doubt they could have escaped.\n Comment: Wild guess but I would say that is just below the frost line.\n Comment: Wiggle your big toe\n Comment: My coworker used to have one.

Like you said, they know what to do, so I’m assuming given at least enough coverage it’s probably totally fine. I’m sure there might be a health benefit from doing it more naturally like this though.\n Comment: The circle of life. When your turtle tree gets big enough? Turtle doves nest in it.

Hibernation isn't the correct word, but I guess she's keeping it in lay terms so the audience gets it!\n Comment: To the last question, for 3 seasons there is a fence that keeps them in… and in the winter she buries them in a hole under 4 feet of dirt.\n Comment: For shurdle my nurdle.\n Comment: So is she /s\n Comment: Me every morning\n Comment: It’s been 5 months.. they’re no longer teenagers.. now they eat old turtle stuff like lettuce n shit\n Comment: I assume she puts them in a bath so they can move around, washes off hard to get spots naturally, and they can drink at their leisure...\n\nThey're 17 so I'm pretty sure this lady knows what she's doing. \n\nI'd be more inclined to dig like a 6x6 foot hole, line it with chicken wire, and then fill it with leaves and other stuff, then put the turtles in the hole and let them dig themselves to hibernate, feeding them a few weeks and then just set up a camera to watch them come out on their own in the spring.\n\nBut I don't own tortoises or turtles lol\n Comment: Wants Hydro Pump a few years early.\n Comment: Tic Tok dogdogcatcatnoodle\n Comment: Turtles and tortoises were treats among sailors because they could just be stored below deck for a couple months and eaten as needed\n Comment: Yes\n Comment: You only want a threesome!\n Comment: Brumation\n Comment: This happened to my aunt, she’s had a turtle living in her back yard for 40+ years now,  but she’s no idea where it came from - it literally just appeared one day. No neighbours were missing one either.\n Comment: Nope, those are [box turtles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_turtle)\n Comment: The common language difference between turtles and tortoises is not has hard set as you want it to be. It is not a scientific distinction and while it is obvious for some it is less so for others (box turtle)\n Comment: If that’s true, this video has made a turn for the worst.\n Comment: Different speakers and varieties of English can have different definitions of the words. [More info here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/EILI5/comments/6ucmgd/eili5_what_is_the_difference_between_a_tortoise/)\n\nThe animals in the video are North American box turtles. Some might call them \"box tortoises\", but that's technically incorrect, as they belong to the family of pond turtles (Emydidae), even though they mostly live on land.\n Comment: I did this to my cat.. still alive 😎\n Comment: Don’t knock it til you try it\n Comment: My turtles stopped eating  on 10/12/22, and didn’t eat again until middle of March after they woke up. It’s biology.\n Comment: Because she intervened and buried them to begin with instead of the turtle taking care of itself naturally.\n Comment: They are [box turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_turtle). Similar in some aspects to tortoises, and therefore easily confused by the uninitiated. Box turtles have a hinge on their shell, which allows them to completely close up (can be seen at the end of the video), hence their name. Tortoises cannot do that.\n Comment: It helps regulate their metabolism, immune system function and has a part to play in their life span. Mirroring their natural processes is good for them, but owners are free to decide what is best for their animals.\n Comment: 😱 that’s horrible lol wtf\n Comment: Bruh what\n Comment: You good?\n Comment: They are [box turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_turtle), not tortoises.\n\nAnd while her method is questionable, some turtle and tortoise species actually do hibernate/brumate underground.\n Comment: By remembering where she buried them. She isn’t a squirrel\n Comment: They **need** that.\n Comment: That’s how box turtles hibernate in nature. They slow their metabolism down to mostly dead and wait out the winter. They are that deep to be below the frost line so the don’t freeze to death. All is well. The one “woke up” before the other is all.\n Comment: I think that they have to be far enough underground to avoid the frost that penetrates the ground during winter\n Comment: >is this a real thing or is that yet another social media person doing stuff to turtles that's insane.\n\nYou apparently missed the part of the video where she mentions they've been hibernating their turtles this way before social media was ever invented.\n\n... and yes, it's a thing. Most species of turtle hibernate (Google fodder \"Brumation\") during the winter.\n Comment: > Those are tortoises. \n\nIncorrect, they are [box turtles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_turtle)\n\n> Turtles have flippers and live in water.\n\n**Sea** turtles. [You might want to read this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/EILI5/comments/6ucmgd/eili5_what_is_the_difference_between_a_tortoise/)\n\n> And tortoises do not hibernate.\n\nIncorrect again. Tortoise species native to climates with cold winters, such as Hermann's tortoises from the Mediterranean, **do** hibernate (well, technically they brumate, but even turtle/tortoise experts often use the words brumation and hibernation interchangeably).\n Comment: I didn’t do it lol.. her shirts says turtle tho and she seems to know what she’s talking about 🤷‍♂️ if what you say is true then yes, it is fucked up\n Comment: Joker, its an animal!\n Comment: And bubbly af\n Comment: >If you aren’t keeping them inside, away from natural predators and winter, you should probably let them actually be free.\n\nWhere they will promptly dig themselves a burrow several feet underground and do the exact same thing on their own.\n\nSeriously WTF? She's not doing it because she's crazy - she's doing it because she knows far more about her turtles than you do.\n Comment: Lol. Also, happy cake day! :)\n Comment: Brumation begins in November and ends around now… No, it is not brumating.\n Comment: She buried them to begin with, that’s how she knows where they are.\n\nBox turtles brumate and will bury themselves. 2 feet is the MAX that they will go down. \n\nShe just just leave them alone and let them take care of themselves.\n Comment: Lol my friends Josh and Chuck would say the same thing\n Comment: ..you AREN’T* 🙃\n Comment: Brumate.

Which is more disturbing.\n Comment: While an accurate statement, once you get down to South Carolina there is no frost line.  In states at and below that line, they only need to be fully covered to hibernate.\n Comment: NOT a freezer!! You can put them in the fridge if its not a vacuum seal.

You should buy a parrot while you're at it.\n Comment: So now we’re pro plastic straws in turtle noses now?

Guy said it is much better to concentrate upon providing a suitable habitat for them and leaving them to it. They really don’t need any help, they just need space and to be left alone.\n Comment: Most children in the uk have an intimate relationship with Blue Peter but only the very lucky few were awarded a badge.\n Comment: Oh wow, I never considered how \"Blue Peter\" would sound to people who didn't grow up in the UK.\n Comment: Blue Peter was a popular Tv show aimed at 5-11 year olds in the uk. They were a blend of entertaining and informing segments with a arts and crafts slot famous for skipping steps (such as waiting for glue to dry) with the phrase “here’s one I made earlier!” Being on the show would net you a Blue Peter badge (the shows blue ship logo on a shield shaped badge) which gave free entry to libraries and attractions all over the country. There were different badges to reflect unique merits also.\n\nThere’s not much on tv exactly like it, I’ve heard it described as the gateway drug for Top Gear before\n Comment: Very, very, very slowly\n Comment: Turtles in places like Minnesota spend the entire winter underwater, under the ice. \n\nThey don’t need much air, obviously, and essentially hold their breath until it thaws. They use chemicals stored in their shells to breakdown the lactic acid that builds up in their muscles. \n\nAs someone who moved to Minnesota from Southern California, I at some point wondered where the heck the turtles went in winter.\n Comment: some turtles can literally breathe through their assholes so, some form of turtle power.\n Comment: breathe through their skin.  due to low temps their metabolism is very slow and their oxygen needs are minimal.\n Comment: Your the OP go research and report back with findings.\n Comment: Some turtles can be totally frozen and then thawed out and be just fine. Slow and steady body functions wins the race.\n Comment: Alligators can also freeze during the winter like it’s nbd. Shits crazy.\n Comment: With their lungs mostly.\n Comment: They did.\n Comment: they'd probably not find a spot good enough for hibernation naturally and die or something. This seems like a good compromise to me.\n Comment: So it wasn’t an accurate statement\n Comment: They are crunchier when frozen\n Comment: Evidence in the wild?\n Comment: Well it’s What happens in the Wild so really isn’t that strange\n Comment: turtiscle\n Comment: Have you seen what they eat in the south?\n Comment: Might have been.

May have been some UK based folks that made it popular then.\n Comment: It's really common in the video game community.\n Comment: Sure. They dig burrows that deep all on their own. Some will go down **8+ feet** to get below the frost line.\n Comment: Yep\n Comment: Nope. He wants her for his wife.\n Comment: > Yeah a terrapin is a tortoise to us.\n\nSounds ridiculous. And who's \"us\"?\n\n> Americans have retarded names for things. Regardless of its genus it’s essentially a land dwelling tortoise. \n\nI think \"box turtle\" is an apt name. And I'm not American. It's definitely not a \"land dwelling tortoise\" (are there aquatic tortoises?), because it has anatomical features that clearly distinguish it from any tortoise, such as the hinged plastron and plantigrade feet (tortoises are digitigrade).\n\n> If you can’t provide them year round heat; what are you even doing owning it?\n\nIf you can't provide them with an environment that mimics their natural one, including cold winters for hibernation, what are you even doing owning it? There's some indication that hibernation is beneficial...\n Comment: Bubbly personality is not a turn on for me lol\n Comment: Yeah my missus is the same\n Comment: Totally agree!

Reptiles only need to supply the energy they expend, unlike mammals who are constantly expending energy even at rest and must consistently eat.\n Comment: Parallel universe Holden Caulfield\n Comment: Here’s a million dollar idea.

Who’s with me Reddit!!!????\n Comment: ^ a new r/shittysuperpowers just dropped\n Comment: Do they ever think \"Damn, my breath smells like shit!\".\n Comment: I remember that TMNT episode where splinter taught the bros that technique\n Comment: Not the species shown in the video (box turtles), though. Also, the few turtle species that can do \"cloacal respiration\" need to be underwater for that, as they use special organs called bursae to extract oxygen from the water. [More info here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/TurtleFacts/comments/gboq5m/turtles_can_breathe_through_their_butts_some/fp99oag/)\n Comment: Fun fact, we, humans, also absorb oxygen through our skin\n Comment: You could just make an artificial spot by putting soil in a box and let them dig themselves so they can also escape themselves, right? That poor guy was trying to escape, but couldn’t because she buried him too deep. And the girl was not ready yet.\n Comment: Well no, the ground that deep shouldn't go to freezing..\n Comment: Or that wild\n Comment: I'm also pro turtles in u/RedSonGamble 's nose\n Comment: No. Only a few *aquatic* turtles are capable of cloacal respiration, which requires them being submerged in water.\n Comment: Well, lets just say, you can breathe out, but you cant breathe in.\n Comment: I miss those days\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: whoever downvoted me, literally why\n Comment: Lol I thought it derived from “narc”\n Comment: Same lool\n Comment: Wait why are we getting turned on by turtles?\n Comment: Longer than that. Chelonians showed up around the Permian era, so about 20 million years before dino's walked the planet. And somehow this woman thinks this is 'helping' them?... Good lawd.\n Comment: I was curious about that also.  Seems like the depth is to get below the frost line.\n Comment: It gets very much so harder to breathe the deeper you are underground. Especially in dense ground.\n Comment: That's how blue waffle was made\n Comment: Slow on the uptake, aren't we?\n\n/s\n Comment: Yea no, but only because it would likely require harming the turtles\n Comment: I'm in!

My guess is there is a pretty big chance that setting up a box for them to hibernate in and they'd not find \"the right spot\" so they'd be stuck searching.\n\nSo what do you decide?

They have less water in their GI tract, so their stool is more solid.\n Comment: As a former dolphin i can confirm\n Comment: yes it is\n Comment: I do, but I have protection, you should try not getting infected more. lol\n Comment: Clearly, this one had something to prove.

Brasch out.\n Comment: I remember as a kid mom made me clean up a squashed cockroach next to our fireplace. It was so traumatizing because of my Mom. She said back when she was a kid in Taiwan she had to clean under the kitchen sink and the 1 inch cockroaches flew and liked to bite. \n\nThat night I had an unholy nightmare of going up to the fireplace to pick up that roach. Either the floor dropped or the fireplace rose in the air. From the crevices of the ground below the fireplace billions of roaches came pouring out and some flew at me. I woke up slapping something buzzing in the air.\n Comment: You can definitely do both of those as a human.\n Comment: Get a hangglider and take some fiber supplements before you fly over that statue.

I've seen many slow-speed turtle-cat chases in my day. This just happens to be the first high-speed turtle-cat chase.\n Comment: Why must I be like that?\n\n\nWhy must I chase the cat?\n Comment: I was gonna say the same thing, when we had turts the cats were always on high alert.\n Comment: And shoes.\n Comment: Same, actually.  My cat had a fixation with my turtle growing up and learned that turtles bite.  Wound up getting his paw in the tank and when the turtle bit the car accidentally launched it into the air.

Just a guess.\n Comment: Yes, many native to the USA.  The RES is a terrible pet due to its size and tank requirements yet there are many species of mud/musk turtles in the 3-6” range.  The reeves seen here is a very popular choice for their small size, peaceful temperament, and simple tank requirements.  They are club footed so shallow water is better and they spend 99% of their time basking.\n Comment: They were young at the time and had a lot of fun tryin to answer that one.

I had no idea there was a difference 😳 \n\nThank you for informing me!\n Comment: All tortoises are indeed turtles bro\n Comment: D’you know what I learned on reddit? All tortoises are turtles but not all turtles are tortoises. I’m still coming to terms with this.\n Comment: Thank you, I know that now! 😅\n Comment: Very important distinction, especially when deciding if you will put one in water.\n Comment: Many languages only have one word for the two species. Same with ape and monkey.\n\nFor example in Dutch, 'schildpad' or German 'Schildkröte', both of which translate to 'shielded toad'. Shield as in the armor.\n Comment: Right. And so we came up with a whole other word, tortoise, because we needed to distinguish these solely land-dwelling Testudines to prevent pedantry.\n Comment: Right, Buffilosoljah. Some \"magical\" animal.\n Comment: Here's the thing\n Comment: How about: all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. That one blew my mind.\n Comment: Great. Now can someone tell me the difference between frogs and toads?\n Comment: To add to this, all toads are frogs… but not all frogs are toads.\n Comment: Maybe today he feels like a 🐢 turtle?\n Comment: Amazing what superglue can do.\n Comment: Your comment made me have flashbacks to a video I saw a while back. These people thought theyd help a turtle find water, and toss him in. He was quite far from the pond they put him in\n\nOnly thing was... It was a tortoise and it probably died :/\n Comment: Skildpade in Danish.\n Comment: Meh. Pendants gonna pet ants.\n Comment: Like Blastoises?\n Comment: To prevent pedantry, or create it? Seems like a turtle is a turtle whether he's wet or dry. Where he roams would be a miniscule detail.\n Comment: All Trans Ams are Firebirds but not all Firebirds are Trans Ams",

Commodifying them is what makes this LibRight.\n Comment: \nPretty much every culture on earth has created some form of dumplings and noodles.

It's just a universally good idea.\n Comment: Asian here. It should be completely fine if a white woman can competently and respectfully master Asian foods if she enjoys doing so. Asian food is great and shouldn't be limited to only Asians.\n\nThat said, if her dumplings and noodles suck, then she'll be lowered into oil along with the next batch of potstickers.\n Comment: H.

She used to be a scientist but turned to cooking and sorta teaches how noodles work in a scientific way. She wanted to recreate Asian recipes but she thought they tasted too westernized when she made them, so she learned from Asian chefs how to cook. \n\nHer entire book is about making Asian cooking practices more accessible to outsiders and spreading the food culture. The fuck does this Twitter dumbass want to happen? Asian culture stays in Asia?\n Comment: I am from Hong Kong, I now announce that everyone get an Asian pass for teaching how to make or enjoying dumplings, noodles, milk tea, eggtart, hot-pot, dimsum, Lunar new year, lucky money, festival lion dance, kungfu etc...\n\nI love people around the world to experience/understand/enjoy our culture and food, mutual understanding and respect is the true cure for racism.

It is to bring together and unite people of a given group, not inherently to exclude.\n\nIf we ever want to truly share the human experience on a more human, united level, all this cultural appropriation BS needs to stop and we need to encourage the sharing of knowledge and appreciation of the positive aspects of cultures everywhere.\n Comment: can twitter stop whining for 1s\n Comment: She actually studied the cuisine for several years and is apparently VERY good at it.

Go ahead and eat whatever you want ~~including humans~~.\n Comment: What kinda psycho would gatekeeping NOODLES? In my humble opinion, noodles should be the thing that unites humanity.

No one but the most authoritarian retards believe in \"cultural appropriation\". I always get a smile on my face when I read about historical polonophiles like Nietzsche or Edgar Allan Poe.\n Comment: Embrace multiculturalism!\n\nNot like that.\n Comment: i hate being libleft sometimes, just let the woman enjoy her noodles smh\n Comment: Relevant Tiktok: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRFe7tbP/\nAsians in Asia also feel that it’s appreciation.\n Comment: And even then they reserve the ability to revoke that joy at any time! Especially if you edgy tweets from 9th grade!\n Comment: Imagine being so unhappy, that you get angry at happy people for being happy, these people live sad lives.\n Comment: When can we all admit sjws belong in an authoritarian quadrant? If they want to control everything you think and do they are authoritarian, even if they want to make you a gay furry.\n Comment: It appears that she barely changed in the past couple is years.\n Comment: I'm pretty sure the white woman who wrote the book is also libleft (albeit not as orange).\n\nAt this point it's just leftist infighting\n Comment: Then maybe she’s actually a based individual who’s just grifting off sjws?\n Comment: Not before linking her PayPal for donations. Got to work that grift baby.\n Comment: I know 3 Pippas and they all look like this.\n Comment: She put in more effort to learn and appreciate a new culture than most people \"born into a culture\" put into learning and appreciating their own. \nLegit based.\n Comment: Ugh, I hate it when people assume the worst in other people. It’s all about respect, people!\n Comment: I don't get it, does Pippa mean something?\n Comment: For real. This woman thinks just because she has slanted eyes she is a better authority on noodles than the woman who *literally* went to noodle college for years and has devoted her life to the culinary arts.

I am going to write a cookbook under my real name with foreign dishes and then using that second profile I'll put my book on blast for cultural appropriation and demand my simp followers retweet and try to get me canceled.

Even if a white woman wasn't \"being faithful\" to the Chinese  dumplings or Korean noodles or whatever they can still be delicious.  Ramen, which is probably Japan's most famous noodle dish internationally, has Chinese origins, so does Pad Thai.  Damn those fucking Thais for culturally appropriating.\n Comment: Yup, it could've easily been a book about Spätzle and Kartoffelklöße.\n Comment: No one does cultural appropriation like the Romans.\n\n(⌐■_■)\n Comment: Italian food actually is a product of colonialism because tomatoes didn't grow in Europe before they were brought there from America.\n\nThe More You Know 🌠🌈\n Comment: As an Italian, no, Eastern Asian noodles, and Italian pasta are two completely different things, with different histories, developments and \"evolutions\".\nWe didn't get our pasta from the Chinese, and Asians didn't get their noodles from us\n Comment: >If they can do it, so can you!\n Comment: shit I can’t disagree.

I took an art history class in college and we had to watch an interesting documentary that covered modern art. One of the people it interviewed was an old retired cartoonist that talked about the relationship between art and the artist. He said that he was heavily distracted in his collection art classes (1960ish) to draw female characters because as a man he would automatically be colonizing them with his eyes. He said that it took him several years after college to get comfortable drawing female characters as he pushed back against his instructors and figured just because he was a man doesn't mean that he lacks the empathy to sympathize with other perspectives even if he can't directly experience them himself. \n\nI couldn't help but think if this line was pushed in the 60s than it seems little coincidence that there was a lack of female characters in \"nerd culture\" in the 80s and 90s if the artists making it were actively discouraged from making them in college. So in conclusion leftist thought on \"cultural appropriation\" and \"cultural closed mindedness\" does play off each other in a cycle.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Based\n Comment: Based and Dumplingpilled\n Comment: The ol Ishikawa Goemon treatment huh\n Comment: Hey, it takes a real Erectus to make a good fire.

They got mocked hard by Japanese gaming outlets and the game sold out in Japan and got rave reviews ( super rare for western games to do well in Japan) The outlets got so offended and the people they virtue signaled for mocking them that they switched to explaining that Samurai were shitty people and we shouldn't play games that glorify them. Very similar to your point.\n Comment: One of my favorite is a basketball player, Kenyon Martin, trying to roast an Asian basketball player, Jeremy Lin, for having dreadlocks saying he’s trying to be black.

I take part in certain cultural events too. People love all that, they love I take an interest in their language and culture. Indeed the often want me to do more than even I want to (e.g. I find white guys in yukata kinda try hard and cringe but had so many Japanese people try to convince me to wear yukata to a maturi)\n\nIn regards to cooking as well they love this shit. I've dated a fair few Japanese girls and a lot of them love following YouTube cooking channels of white girls making Asian food.\n\nAlso I might add Japan has a tonne of their own versions of white food.Italian dishes are popular here for example if often different (squid ink pasta 🤤).

Saying he was taking the place away from a *real* japanese person whose culture it is. Saying he was making a \"mockery\" of Japanese culture by being there.\n\nTurns out, he's considered one of the highest level players of the shakuhachi flute in the world. He had to get a master *license* from a \"Grand Master\" of the instrument. so, people in Japan were overjoyed that a part of their traditional culture was shown on the big stage, done by someone who dedicated their life to mastering the instrument. It was a conference by Sony (a Japanese company) showing \"Ghosts of Tsushima\" (a game about feudal Japan) showcasing a traditional Japanese instrument. Literally the *least* important thing on their mind was his skin colour.\n Comment: She loves to use her noodle to get what she wants.\n Comment: How dare she have a passion for something loved in another country\n Comment: I thought you would like the noodles more because they were white\n Comment: I love pierogi bro.\n\nViva Poland!

Woman is lucky if she has a job after 25\n Comment: >where does the line fall between \"enjoying Japanese culture\" and being a weeb? \n\nHonestly as someone experienced with this I would say a few main factors\n\n1) Surface level enjoyment. They'll enjoy things as long as they're simple. For example they like anime and know words like Baka and neko or some shit. But when it comes to actual language they give up. I've learned Japanese for 10 years and lived here for 5. I am extremely proficient at Japanese and can tell you 99% of people who start the language will never get there. They'll quit halfway through, keep finding reasons not to etc. Not that that's a bad thing per say, but to insist you love a country so much but then not put any effort into learning about it is kinda dumb and superficial. Indeed we have a LOT of foreigners here who do English teaching 🤮, never learn the language and treat the place like a huge Disneyland. People who insist they love it here but CBA actually ever learning about it\n\n2) Anime obsession. It's weird the amount of times I've been asked if I started Japanese because I like anime. I don't even watch anime! Not saying that anime is bad, most Japanese love it too, but those who obsess over it and assume it represents Japan are annoying as fuck.\n\n3) refusal to admit the bad. There are many problems with Japan it isn't utopia here. People who idolize this place are far too many. \n\n4) Assumption that Japan is special in some way. It isn't. I love it here but my day is wake up, go to work, eat ramen for lunch, come back, have a walk, watch YouTube with some beers, sleep. It's just a normal place.\n\nIn general the difference is actually knowing about Japan and understanding the good and the bad and knowing barely anything, refusing to learn more, and idolizing it based on the small amount you know\n\nWorst part is there are a lot of weebs over here and they give the rest of us a bad name. So few foreigners speak the language that the automatic assumption upon entering anywhere is you can't speak/read if you're white. Once you speak to them in Japanese they'll suddenly instantly switch to Japanese mode but whenever you enter a place there's always a look on the workers face of \"fuck I can't speak English\". Damn weebs, they ruined japan\n Comment: I probably don't speak for everyone in Japan but as a Jap, I'd say I'm most happy to share information about my culture to people who're willing to hear about all of it. \n\nTo me, culture is a set of shared experiences across a group of people. These experiences can be both positive and negative but the idea is if you can talk to some random stranger about some experience you had, that stranger would likely have had something very similar. \n\nA weeb would thus, be someone who's only interested in talking about positive or fun experiences like anime, ramen, or I guess these days, vtubers. They often don't care about the less positive or fun experiences so I have little respect for these types, especially when they try to claim they know more about Japan than I do. These are the people I call dirty foreigners behind their backs.\n\nSomeone who legitimately enjoys Japanese culture should also be interested in talking and learning about the more negative or mundane experiences such as navigating hierarchical relationships, work culture, or even the experience of riding a crammed train to work/school every day. These are the people in my life who've asked me the tough questions about how Japanese society works and I'm more than happy to discuss with them about it. \n\nAlso, I don't know, maybe if weebs learned to be a bit more discreet then maybe people wouldn't look down on them so much?\n Comment: Who cares?\n Comment: At the bit where you become annoying about it.\n Comment: Obsession is the differentiating factor. There's nothing wrong with liking or loving something but becoming obsessed is when it goes too far.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Just in general, people like it when other people enjoy things they enjoy.\n Comment: They are dude.  I remember being at ramen shops in Tokyo and the chef would be excited to see us take our first bite\n Comment: Yeah I love it when people like my culture’s food like kimchi.\n Comment: I mean they're not wrong.\n Comment: Not going to deny that xenophobia exists but when it comes to sharing culture with foreigners, I'm pretty sure it comes from a place of \"This person took the time to learn about our culture even though they probably has better things to do with their lives\". The fact you put in the effort to learn is what makes us excited.\n\nMore than that though, I'm pretty sure getting excited when somebody talks about how your culture is cool beyond the obvious stereotypes is a pretty universal experience as long as you're not American. You lot have exported your culture so much that you've probably come to expect everyone to know everything about the things you grew up with.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: What about the xenophobia i read about all the time in Japan. Is that only expressed towards unknowledgeable foreigners or is it something you just haven’t experienced in your circles but know its generally true.\n Comment: Wait, that girl was Asian?

Her intention was clearly to appreciate the culture, rather than adopt or claim it.\n Comment: I’m multiracial but I was born in another country and immigrated here. English is technically also my second language but I’ve been here long enough that my English is better than my native language. \n\nThey don’t care about these intricacies, if you look caucasian (which I do), then they insist that you are 100% caucasian and if you participate in your home country’s culture, they consider it cultural appropriation. I’ve been told this both online and to my face by these people.\n Comment: its pretty simple. they hate white people. it doesnt matter what it is if you are white sjws hate you for the original sin of racism despite every other culture in the world also being racist at some point in history. all the word salad is just a way to justify their hate.\n Comment: A lot of southern food is carried over from slaves!

Reply /info for more info.\n Comment: Eating straight boiled wheat or cooked like rice (like couscous) is more basic but noodles taste good and don't need any special technology.  Plus, because of the gluten, if a culture wants to make noodles, wheat is the best option as long as they can grow it.  Rice noodles are far harder to make.\n Comment: I missed you too! :)\n Comment: Imma stay in my libleft quadrant but I'm becoming incresing right with others in the same quadrant.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I’m definitely moving tight economically but socially I tend to stay left.  retarded shit like this makes it hard\n Comment: Ikr just happy to be doing something she loves.  \n\nPeople like having power over others. Outrage gives them that power in some sense because the mob is reactionary.  They signal themselves as ‘allies’ while also taking down someone they see as ‘the oppressor’ it’s mostly just a LARP, but increased reliance on social media during Covid has magnified quite a bit I think.\n Comment: With or without prints?\n Comment: That’s what a guy with one body pillow says to try and justify it.

I Don't think many people in Japan are; male or female.\n Comment: I watched a video on YouTube that followed around a typical Japanese salaryman during a normal work day.\n\nI honestly don’t know how the Japanese have earned an efficient reputation, the poor guy must have spent half his day travelling around Tokyo all for the sake of a few 15 minute face to face meetings answering customers’ questions.\n\nSure, it’s all well and good the Japanese consider it good professional behaviour and tradition that these brief face to face meetings are considered important, but ultimately this guy’s spent 2 hours commuting across from the other side of the city for a brief meeting that could have much more easily been dealt with via a phone call or an email.\n Comment: You do realize it's not 1995 anymore right? That shit doesn't apply as much these days. Heck my last company I think I worked maybe 50 hours a week during busiest months and my new one max 45.\n\nWhat I find funny is it's usually Americans who make these comments when if you look it up Americans on average work more hours than us\n\nNot denying there are black companies but that image of Japan isn't as applicable these days compared to 20-30 years ago. It's basically what the American society tells their people so they think \"see we don't have it so bad\" while working 60+ hour weeks. Oh and unlike you guys we have healthcare and labour laws\n\nAlso I assure you most women after 25 have a job lmao. The only ones who don't are married (AVG marriage age 32) and that's because they WANT to. Literally 80% of high school girls surveyed say they want to be a housewife in the future. Turns out a piss easy job while living on someone else's money is a huge privilege and not oppression, who knew\n Comment: *Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere Intensifies.*\n Comment: yeah mongolia sounds fucking based\n Comment: Yeah Kimchi is really good too\n Comment: Being Brazilian, I find it quite funny, but also rather annoying when I meantion I'm Brazilian and people mention stuff like \"samba\" or \"futebol\"/soccer. I'd be completely delighted if they said \"I love goiabada com queijo\" however, and that's because it's some effort to see our culture, even if only on a specific region, outside of stereotypes, and it's such an amazing thing, I can't even describe how well I would feel about that with words.\n Comment: If you’re European or fair skinned you’re good.

They mentioned \"you shouldn't check Asian on diversity scholarships but you will\", when selecting Asian for diversity measures is the worst option\n Comment: I live when they pull that shit. Most Soul food and other things insane people try to claim as black food are just things that poor people ate in the south. Very few of them are uniquely black.\n Comment: Hah to be fair was gonna mention that. Italians are a special exception because of how ridiculously serious they are about food. Maybe American or Spanish food etc would have been a better example\n\nThat said, the difference is even with Italians they don't call the people who don't make their food the \"right\" way racist\n Comment: Based and innuendo pilled.\n Comment: People who say Kill All Men\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Are you people really afraid of a bunch of wimpy kids on twitter?\n Comment: Or they get taken as far right conservatives and dismissed\n Comment: based af but flair the fuck up\n Comment: S-s-s-salt and Pippa's here!\n Comment: In most North American cities, the most conservative urban inhabitants usually are immigrants\n Comment: My ex befriended these people from quebec and her personality changed.

Instead of eating the tubers of the potato plant, they tried the fruits. Which are green, similar to unripe tomatoes, not very tasty and in large amounts poisonous... well, there's a reason that they are normally not eaten. So, in many communities they at first refused the new strange plant.\n Comment: While on this subject, who cares? If a method of cooking was invented in some place, it's never allowed to be used by anyone other than.. who? People who were born into that culture? For how many generations? Should all inventions be handled like that? \"You're only ever allowed to use an invention in it's place of origin.\" Sometimes I wish for a proper world war to get people focused on some actual problems instead of living in this soft state of affairs where we have so little of any actual problems that we go out of our way to invent them.\n\nPlus, while on the subject of culture, one of the defining reasons why asian culture differs so much from western culture can be explained by the crop used in these foods. Wheat vs rice. Rice is a crop that requires conforming to a strict co-operation to accomplish getting food while wheat requires a lot less of a community, leading to a more individualistic culture. Historically speaking that is.\n Comment: Sounds like a great idea.\n Comment: I could get behind that tbh\n Comment: They should do it anyway.\n Comment: wtf I love getting mad at people for cultural appropriation now\n Comment: Nah.  White Australians, Canadians, and all those other European settled countries don't have a cultural identity.

You could possibly die from eating unripe tomatoes, potatoes, or eggplants but it would take ingesting several kilos worth under normal circumstances. \n\nIt takes somewhere around 3-5mg per kg of body weight to get a lethal dose of solanine.

I kept telling them that it wasn't, but they didn't want to hear it. I ran back to my spot to get the binoculars, but they called the police before I got back. \n\nA few minutes later, a cop shows up in full body armor and starts running down the beach with a flotation device.

It looks pretty bazaar\n Comment: That thing ugly\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: That is one sexy mf\n Comment: \"Crocodilian\" sounds like you made that term up lol\n Comment: Probably pissed off there is a whole crowd staring at him and filming him while he is having a hard time moving to water. I know I would be annoyed. Give animals some space people , appreciate them/nature from a distance!\n Comment: Imagine weighting a ton, and having to drag yourself across the beach using two oars on your tummy.\n Comment: Me at the hotel breakfast buffet on vacation\n Comment: I would be tired too if I weighed 500kg, had only flippers to move and had 20something people around me all gawking.\n Comment: That's a female. You try dragging 2K lbs around.\n Comment: He’s probably 50 years old. At the end of life expectancy.\n Comment: The people are actually 2km away\n Comment: Well, they get to a max of about 6' long, so, perspective is playing a big part here.\n Comment: While they do get huge, this one is not. There's so much detail you can see in the sand, and the particles are visible.\n Comment: well that's fucking depressing\n Comment: Small car size in what regard? That turtle looks to not even be waist height.\n Comment: They're very big but the video makes it seem much larger than they are.  One might think, at a glance, that the turtle is about half the height a person and about the length of 9 people standing shoulder to shoulder.\n\nThey're not even half as big as that.  Here's a video more representative of their size:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcQtUvE04Ok\n Comment: >small car size\n\nWhy do redditors always need [to get carried away?](https://media.13newsnow.com/assets/WVEC/images/66a8b8a4-82c5-496c-b6a2-fe8bf98d1e15/66a8b8a4-82c5-496c-b6a2-fe8bf98d1e15_750x422.jpg)\n\nThey're fucking huge, that's enough.

Biggest sand mass outside of the Sahara\n Comment: I snorkeled in the ocean off the coast of Hawai'i with a green sea turtle once and even those guys are huge, that one was probably five feet long - and he outswam me with ease and wasn't even trying, of course. He was probably five times faster and he was moving so slowly and gracefully. At one point he came close enough that I could have reached out and touched him. It was insane.\n Comment: Yeah, my dad tells stories about coming across one in Moreton Bay while fishing in a tinny, and the turtle was longer than their boat.\n Comment: Great joke, but for people not in the know and in the US. You can get fined, arrested, or the shit beaten by locals.\n Comment: 😂😂👌\n Comment: Seriously. That perspective was fucked!

SZIA!!!\n Comment: Even if the video makes it look larger than it is, it's still very large. They average around 6 1/2 feet long (or about 2 meters) and weigh between 500 and 1500 pounds (or 250 - 700 kg).\n Comment: The petspective did somewhat made the Turtle in video appear larger, but\n\n\"reaching lengths of up to 2.7 metres (8 ft 10 in) and weights of 500 kilograms (1,100 lb)\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle\n\nThat is still massive.\n Comment: it would’ve taken you one second to google their size\n Comment: Funny how the first two comments disproved people like you immediately lol\n Comment: Ok Frieza.\n Comment: You enjoy the refreshing flavor of jellyfish?\n Comment: They are, these people just aren't familiar with the guideliness that you should follow if you encounter a sea turtle.\n Comment: For real.

Jfc.\n Comment: As the name implies, it doesn't have a shell. That's leathery skin.\n Comment: since its a sea turtle its streamlined much like soft shell turtles they can swim faster,.\n Comment: Everyone here MIGHT be autistic, but they’d likely mostly have different responses.\n Comment: i know right lol straight up morons\n Comment: Tell that to the sea turtle that slapped my ass while I was getting out of the water.\n\n(Real anecdote, everyone on the boat laughed)\n Comment: The Hilton Waikoloa in Hawai'i has employees that specifically protect the beaches (beachfront hotel) that green sea turtles nest on and keep people away from the nesting mothers and hatching babies, and also to scare away sea birds that try to eat the turtle hatchlings before they can reach the sea.\n Comment: Yeah I personally think they were way too close.\n Comment: Yeah! Speak it out bro.\n Comment: Its the life they chose.\n Comment: Exactly, the turtle's 2 cm long\n Comment: Why? Things die. Especially in 'Stralia.\n Comment: Man it's easy to see sea dwelling creatures on land when they are dead . \n\nSooo many dead bottle nose dolphins living in O Grove, Spain.\n\nBut it's just that they like hanging out in that coast\n Comment: He's clearly talking about the turtles in general not this one.\n Comment: Probably weight\n Comment: The video says \"This turtle isnt even close to the largest of its kind\" \\[00:37\\] I agree calling them the size of a small car is misleading, but this video is not representative either (by its own admission).\n Comment: Leatherbacks are the largest of the seven living sea turtle species, growing to more than 6.5 feet (two meters) in length and weighing up to 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms\n Comment: Still, 10 feet long and 900 kilos is pretty big.\n Comment: Ah, it's marginal, but I think still a reasonable comparison. Take a Fiat Cinquecento, very much a small car. It weighs 702 kg not counting the driver, and is 3.23 metres long. The largest leatherback turtle ever measured was 3.05 metres long and weighed 916 kg. So the turtle is a tiny bit shorter than the car but outweighs it.\n Comment: There are numerous small cars under 3 metres and less than 900kg.\n Comment: Oh shit. You have a huge ass. \n Comment: More european car, not american\n Comment: up to 10ft long and 1500lbs...not much perspective going on there. does this turtle look 20ft long to you?\n Comment: Lol I’m curious what did he say\n Comment: Those things get up to 700kg and 2 meters in length. It isn't just the perspective. They are actually huge.\n Comment: Thanks! Learned some new mythology\n Comment: in this case, it really sucks that it laid them in front of tourists. they don't have a good rep when it comes to handling turtle eggs.\n Comment: All things serve the beam\n Comment: The turtle moves.\n Comment: nuh uh its a telescopic lense, the people are 500 ft away /s\n\nthat's a big fucking turtle\n Comment: Thank you for using metric kind sir.\n Comment: An absolute unit of a turtle!\n Comment: Hell nah!\n Comment: Costumes*\n Comment: Not like it shows in this video though they max out around 6 feet\n Comment: Definitely not a small beast\n\nBut the angle clearly tries to make it seem bigger\n Comment: Damn!!! Do they eat humans sometime? /s\n Comment: Ooze.  This goes way back. Not all of the cannisters were disposed of.\n Comment: Dayum\n Comment: I meant the people. It’s a UK term for fuck this.\n Comment: Yes but I thought it was way bigger than it was hahaha then I realized how close the camera was to the sand\n Comment: Yeah, well it seems there is really no pleasing you people; the other day I expressed my surprise in a subreddit about a turtle farm, wondering why people still eat turtles these days (I thought they were protected or something) and I was downvoted by everyone one and their mother from Central Asia to America, so I'd figured I best join them...\n Comment: Can confirm I was the boat\n Comment: Because 'stralia makes you feel down. That's why it's \"down under\". Nobody goes there to be happy. Even the toilet flushes the wrong way.\n Comment: I would have guessed at most zero dead dolphins living in Spain...\n Comment: General turtles\n Comment: The video says they've been recorded weighing 900kg, that's a little bit more than my car. It's not even a 2-door car, thought it is small. I think you're right\n Comment: [ **Jump to 00:37 @** Giant leatherback sea turtle stranded on Cape Cod rescued by volunteers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcQtUvE04Ok&t=0h0m37s)\n \n ^(Channel Name: Guardian News, Video Length: [01:04])^, [^Jump ^5 ^secs ^earlier ^for ^context ^@00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcQtUvE04Ok&t=0h0m32s) \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n ^^Downvote ^^me ^^to ^^delete ^^malformed ^^comments.

Stop digging.\n Comment: That's bigger than a classic Mini!\n Comment: may 6. not 10.\n Comment: i dont debate that at all just sounds a bit exaggerated if they say \"small size car\" i expect it to be that height as well not only the weight/length and visually its obviously never as big as a cinquecento. its more like a big heavy chunk of flesh\n Comment: If you wanna be that generous you may as well start comparing mice to small cars, as well. Hot Wheels cars. This is why measuring things by arbitrary non-standards is stupid and misleading.\n Comment: yeah still not the same. if you compare it to a small car it will still look smaller than the car because its compact flesh. weightwise, yes but it doesnt look as big as a small car\n Comment: You know how big ten feet are?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: its probably pretty illegal to steal/harm the eggs, so hopefully no one does anything to them\n Comment: It can be both you know.\n Comment: Man, you guys are a whimsical people. I fuck with it.\n Comment: It *is* the biggest turtle in the world, though.\n Comment: That's wild. I responded how I did because there are a lot of preconceived notions about turtle/shark soup, and the way they're processed/ disregarded are absolutely attrocious.  Make no mistake, if a shark/turtle soup used used the entire carcass, whether to increase quantity of soups served or affect changes in quality, I'd be all for it. However, people use exclusively the fin of sharks for their soup. It's really disheartening: an entire animal disregarded and thrown as waste for one soup that someone may not even finish. \n\nSorry for your experiences in other threads.\n Comment: I've had snapping turtle soup. It wasn't pleasant.\n Comment: Can confirm I was the sea turtle\n Comment: Can confirm. I was The Table on the boat\n Comment: You should try welding this side of the equator. Overhead is easier than down hand :((\n Comment: When there is no more room in hell, the arroaces will flop the earth.\n Comment: Comparing the weight is not a good idea to gauge size.  The turtle will be about as dense as water while the metal and plastic making up a car is much lighter by volume.  Also a car has a lot of empty space in it that a turtle obviously doesn't.\n Comment: I would say due to shape, the classic bug is the nearer comparison.\n Comment: 6 is average adult size, 10 is the biggest officially recorded one.\n Comment: That's fair. Probably better to compare it to a medium-sized cow.\n Comment: > its more like a big heavy chunk of flesh\n\naren't we all?\n Comment: Really, that's 100% on how you deciphered the information. Use basic critical thinking skills. \n\nWhy would a sea creature need to be tall? They can travel vertically in their environment.\n\nWhy would a living creature be more dense than a car? A car needs large empty spaces inside to hold people and things.\n\nDo any animals match the exact dimensions of a car? I really, really doubt a single one matches the height, length, width, and weight of any exact car.\n Comment: I feel like this is on you. I don't know why you would expect it's dimensions to be exactly the same as a small car. A car has an empty room inside of it for you to sit in. A turtle doesn't\n\nI wouldn't expect it to be 'exactly' as tall as a car too. First things I would think of are in terms of weight and length.\n Comment: That’s on you I guess. I didn’t think height at all\n Comment: Also the leather back grows up to 8 feet not 10. And some sources even say smaller up to 6 feet.\n Comment: Fair\n Comment: Flats must be tough.\n Comment: r/veryimportantcorrections\n Comment: But how many medium sized cows is one small car?\n Comment: Iv’e seen these in person\n Comment: Asking the big questions!\n Comment: Just cause you see them in person doesn’t mean your eyes have measuring capabilities to tell you the size! You can guesstimate but that’s it, even that could be wrong, the average sidewalk is three feet(one meter) that turtle is two sidewalk squares  big not three our four!\n Comment: so angry over a 10 ft turtle. i mean, maybe it's your eyes. does this video make the turtle look like gamera from the godzilla movies ***to you***?",

Were they rescued and released?\n Comment: Plot twist : they’re tortoises committing suicide\n Comment: How old would a turtle that large be?\n Comment: Is this real\n Comment: They can get are very large, but I'm pretty this video recorded using a telephoto lens, which can flatten everything making things look bigger than they are.. the people in the background are probably like 20 to 30 yards away coupled with a low-angle and a very large depth of field, makes this thing look like the size of a Smart Car. .\n Comment: I’m just hearing Fiddler’s Green play in the background watching this. Just me? 😅\n Comment: The only thing unbelievable about this is how far back people stood to let the turtle do its thing.\n Comment: That thing is probably older than everyone on the planet\n Comment: It looks bigger than it is in this video because the people are always behind it. Put someone slightly in front snd you'll realise it's big, but not quit so much of a unit as it appears. You couldn't pick up a large one, that's for sure, but then most of them aren't that large. They CAN grow to above 6ft long.\n Comment: Lodizal up!\n Comment: How did it was washed to the beach...??\n Comment: This is actually me getting out of bed every morning.

Is she trying to escape from the attention? Or does she revel in it?\n Comment: Do they taste good?\n Comment: What sucks is that in many cities where humans have encroached into their habitat, baby sea turtles are confused by city lights.  It messes up their internal navigation and instead of crawling towards the sea when they hatch, they often go in the direction of human made light and die as a result by being run over or exhaustion as they never make it out to sea.  Biologists and conservationists have known this for years.\n\nA simple solution would be black out netting along beaches where they nest, or the removal of lighting during nesting season- but city officials won't enact those measures as it 'devalues' the look of their beach real estate.\n Comment: They get that big,?,?,???????\n Comment: They weigh up to 1400 pounds, so they're around 7 times the size of the average grown man.\n Comment: That's one huge turt for sure!\n Comment: Looks like my grandma\n Comment: Almost as large as your mother.\n Comment: Why was it up on the shore like that if it's hard for them to get back in the water?\n Comment: Drunk dad in a costume...\n Comment: Looks more like the largest turtle on the beach.\n Comment: r/mypeopleneedme\n Comment: That's very similar to my push ups. About as much clearance...\n Comment: That thing used to be one of those hundrends of cute flippity little shits you see on those turtle hatching videos on the beach, frantically scrabling to the ocean as soon as they hatch to avoid getting plucked by seagulls. Now Seagulls won't even try it. Lol\n Comment: The struggle is real.\n Comment: I have seen several of these in person, about 6 adults and many, many babies. The adults aren't as large as the first shot forces pespective on you, but were definitely bigger than the second clip. They are MASSIVE. The babies were barely the size of my hand.

Turns out it was a dead sea turtle.  It was really disheartening somehow.  Then some official looking people ran up and got on the phone for some sort of cleanup party.

They'll close entire beaches and shut down boardwalk businesses to enforce this.\n\nThis could also have been an injured one released back into the wild that people gathered to see.\n Comment: I'm guessing this isn't America.

Unless there are underwater gangs, you picked the wrong animal, bud.\n Comment: This is how I feel when I’m trying to run fast in a dream\n Comment: I was snorkeling off the coast of Maui in a random off the road spot (literally the entire island coast is amazing coral all over) - was in some shallow water and one of these big boys was just swimming. It was very intimidating and I gave it a wide berth because even if not going to eat me, large enough and quick enough to hurt me out of fear.\n Comment: They are really big but the camera angle, at first, made it look much larger.\n Comment: It's not that big by the way, this is a case of confusing perspective\n Comment: It's not at all.\n Comment: I just was thinking same that jurassic world is real\n Comment: Fun fact, aquatic reptiles and flying reptiles are not dinosaurs, although they coexisted.\n Comment: “No it’s fine everybody. I’ll just do it myself. Just stand there and watch me”\n Comment: It's not THAT big, this is a case of confusing perspective, you can compare the size of the waves crashing into the turtle to the size of the waves hitting the people behind and you'll find that it is about 30 cm tall, and not 1 meter as it looks like in the clip. \n\nStill a big boi, but not massive\n Comment: It's forced perspective, while they are huge, they are not nearly as big as this pic would have you believe...\n Comment: > 4 wet pieces of paper to help inch your way forward\n\nProbably more like diving fins attached at your elbows and knees, and you're forced to wear a hollowed out jetski hull.\n Comment: Now it lurks beneath waiting for it’s next victim….\n Comment: banana\n\nYou're welcome.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Same.  And when he made it to the water, I was cheering and going \"you did it, doesn't  that feel good?!“\n Comment: Evolution doesn't twist anything. Evolution doesn't favor the best way, only the way that still works.\n Comment: Turtles have been on earth for more than 200 million years compared to about 2.5 mill for humankind. To survive that long demonstrates that evolution has worked just fine and if they're encountering problems now we can probably blame human impact rather than any 'failing' of evolution 😢.\n\nEdit to add very sad face\n Comment: Right?! While I thought turtle was stellar, I could really only think about the random dips and fingers that upset me more than it should hahah\n Comment: But did you see that giant that walked in front of the camera?\n Comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leatherback\\_sea\\_turtle\n Comment: Force perspective also depends on your experience. If you don't know how big it's supposed to be it seems bigger, if you do it never looks as though it's a different size than it should be.\n Comment: You mean the turtle isn’t the size of a Camry!?!?\n Comment: You can ride any large sea creature, but whether you'd live long enough to tell anyone is the point!\n Comment: Yeah, but only if you’re a clownfish\n Comment: Where I live (southern coast of Mexico), we intentionally hide the nest, rather than section it off and make it easier for poachers to find. \n\nThat said, poaching is also down a ton due to education. But if you want to dramatically increase the odds of a nest being raided, be sure to section it off so the poachers know where to dig.\n\nAs to the 20 miles part. Turtles don't care at all about humans. I was having dinner on the beach once and a turtle pushed the table out of the way, dug a hole, laid her eggs and went back to the ocean. It's almost hard to exaggerate how little concern they have about people. We got out some rakes to obfuscate where the nest was and went about our night. \n\nRelated: Sometimes we will be having dinner or drinks on the beach and a turtle boil (hatching event) will happen under someones chair or a few feet away. Dozens of adorable little turtle making a run to the ocean. Super adorable. If there are seagulls around, we'll use flashlights or brooms to scare them off and reduce predation on the turtles.\n Comment: I am smaller than the leatherback turtle. Welp.\n Comment: It’s real\n Comment: Because it can do it on its own, and it's probably dangerous. Also it probably weighs a shit ton, idk what a few beach-goers could actually do to help.\n Comment: Don't forget that turtles can be dangerous too, especially this big\n Comment: They have existed for a long time without anyone 'helping' them back into the sea. Best thing for people to do is sit quietly, watch and appreciate nature.\n Comment: It’s not beached\n Comment: It’s the largest turtle\n Comment: 5 (maybe 6)\n Comment: Or, you know,  have babies in the ocean might be an easier solution.\n Comment: They swim out of the sea and onto the beach to lay eggs, then they drag themselves back out to sea.\n Comment: Just a nudge? Anything, guys!\n Comment: net geo videographer watching an innocent animal getting brutally ripped apart feet in front of them: 👍\n\ndisclaimer: i love nat geo, and it really isnt humans place to interfere. animals get eaten, thats just how it be\n Comment: He just ate a little too much at Chipotle, guys\n Comment: You got me cackling. Scared the wife and dog\n Comment: Yeah I agree… turtle needs a bit of help to the water… it’s hard working on arms and legs… but I respect that turtle for pushing on! They look exhausted. Glad to see they made it to the water!\n Comment: Yeah he looks exhausted and tired. 🥲He could use a lift or push\n Comment: I mean I would have thought people could push it from the back or somthing. \n\nI would have tried.\n Comment: Right, ain't that the coolest thing ever! \n\nDon't mess w the dinosaurs if u see em in the wild....\n Comment: Animal?  More like big animal!\n Comment: Seriously... that thing looks like it's the size of a Fiat.\n Comment: forced perspective it's not that large. The Leatherback Sea turtle is the largest living sea turtle, weighing in at between 550 and 2,000 pounds with lengths of up to six feet\n Comment: Except these turtles actually do show up in America (specifically Florida) where they are subject to ridiculous levels of legal protection. Anyone fucking with a sea turtle can and will get arrested as another commentator has pointed out. \n\nIn fact, during nesting season all the hotels and resorts are required to abide by lighting regulations so that baby sea turtles aren’t confused by the lights and swim out to sea properly. \n\nI know this is Reddit so we all love to dunk on America but these animals are under *heavy* legal protection in the US.\n\nSource: actually worked with marine biologists with Leatherback Sea Turtles.\n Comment: People in America would be trying to ride it while taking selfies.\n\n(It’s a joke in case you are very humorless).\n Comment: <*buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp*\\> me!\n Comment: Someone moved a chair in the past and for some reason you're the only one to notice the difference it caused.\n Comment: and the pizza\n Comment: Water rat? 🤔\n Comment: Or trying to punch but usually I can't operate my phone in my dreams\n Comment: You too? Feel like crawling up a wall, in water, with weights on?\n Comment: Similar thing happened to me in Maui! I was just swimming off a small beach and a dude snorkeling nearby looked at me and pointed down. I looked down and there was a turtle the size of a coffee table maybe 2-3 feet away from me that I hadn't even noticed. Makes you think twice about what is just out of sight underwater!\n Comment: \"They just STOOD THERE?\" \n\nYeah Frank, they were just as useless as you after that shark bite.\n Comment: 600-2000+lbs and 4-10ft is pretty damn big tbh.\n Comment: I mean any animal that’s larger than my 7’ dinner table is going into the “f’ing large” category lol\n Comment: Phew....good thing you were here to clear that up for all of us.\n Comment: All my homies hate smoking 😎\n Comment: Indeed.\n Comment: Um human kind as we are today has only been proven to about 250,000 bc\n Comment: I am not disputing that a leatherback turtle is a large animal I am disputing this video as it suggests that the turtle is bigger than it is using forced perspective.\n Comment: I had trouble with that link. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle) one may work better. \n\n> The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)... is the largest of all living turtles and the heaviest non-crocodilian reptile, reaching lengths of up to 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) and weights of 500 kilograms (1,100 lb).\n Comment: Your not wrong, and I can't even argue that!\n Comment: More like if you wanna be dressin like a clownfish after they fit you with those felonies lol.\n Comment: It's like pushing a car. 😂 Heavy but possible. Especially if you are 2-3 who help.\n Comment: Lifting her in the back or pushing a little won't hurt. She's having an entire hard shell in the way to bite.\n Comment: Come on guys you couldn’t setup a slip and slide for the turtle? Brutal. I burned 400 calories just watching this and now my arms and legs are sore.\n Comment: “People are fucking useless, turt… one of them was just recording the whole ordeal…”\n Comment: Those things are so damn enormous.  Might as well try to show a boulder. \n\nNow I’m wondering how many people a leatherback on land could easily plow through\n Comment: Nudge, nudge, know what I mean?\n Comment: The least you could do is say no. Why are you all ignoring my pleas for help!\n Comment: She… they only come ashore to lay eggs.\n Comment: She they only come ashore to lay eggs. This is part of their lifecycle not a stranding.\n Comment: Why though? The animal is obviously doing it just fine on it's own. They were probably doing this before modern humans were around and will probably continue doing it after humans are gone.\n Comment: I kno right? I would have been here ya go bro! 💪🏻 Then hopefully he would pop his head out of the water and give me a wink or a little turtle hand wave or something. WOULD BE THE BEST THING EVER\n Comment: \"it's not that large\"\n\n\"It's 2000 lbs\"\n\nLmao that sounds pretty large to me\n Comment: I was gonna say that I don’t see really any videos of people fucking with sea turtles. I’m sure it happens but most videos I see are people maintaining a pretty respectful perimeter around them. \n\nYou’d be hard pressed to find a sea turtle on a populated beach you could even get near from my experience. I’ve been to a couple beaches in Hawaii where a turtle was nesting and the area had caution tape around it with all kinds of warning signs about them being a protected species. Always assumed it was kind of common knowledge at this point that you can’t just walk up to them and pet them.\n Comment: America and Canada probably have the best conservation efforts on earth for endangered species. Us and Australia of course. But yeah, do not fuck with eagles, sea lions, bears, turtles, or manatees, that shit will get you locked up or reduce your net worth to zero\n\nWhich thankfully, most Americans are reasonable to understand these laws\n Comment: I am glad to hear that. In my home state of Alabama, as far as I know, there isn't an overwhelming protection for wildlife like this, granted I didn't grow up nor spend much time near the coast so I could be wrong.\n Comment: Yeah literally happened near my hometown years ago. https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/woman-photographed-sitting-sea-turtle-arrested/27084937/?outputType=amp\n Comment: But also it’s the truth and you know it\n Comment: Nah you’re right. Americans are on a whole different level of narcissistic stupidity. It’s on full display for the world to see now.\n Comment: Yes but who moved said chair who? 🤔\n Comment: And the journalist\n Comment: You punch with your phone?\n Comment: That's interesting, I can't either. The buttons all keep moving around or they're in a weird order and I can't dial anyone or do anything with it. I think I read somewhere that the part of the mind that deals with reading doesn't work well when dreaming. So I suppose most people don't dream of reading a book lol.\n Comment: *The sea was angry that day, my friends - like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. I got about fifty feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell you, he was ten stories high if he was a foot.*\n Comment: Yes it is, but this video makes the turtle seem about twice that size\n Comment: Towards the end of the video you can see closer to the actual size of the turtle so that it doesn’t look like a dinosaur\n Comment: Good critical thinking skills\n Comment: > I had trouble with that link.\n  \nThat's because you're on old reddit, and the devs don't care about you so they intentionally make your user experience worse so you'll move :p\n Comment: Yeah, except it's a car in wet sand, without wheels. Also you usually push a car because it's broken down, but this guy's just going about his business lol, he's got it covered, he doesn't need any help.\n Comment: The don't need help. In fact if you \"helped\" the babies into the water after they hatched you'd kill them all. They need to drag themselves across the sand in order to help develop their flipper muscles to aid in swimming and for females eventually climbing back on land to lay eggs. They've been around since the dinosaurs and don't need our \"help\"\n Comment: Leatherback turtles have a soft shell. Leave it be, it obviously figured out life better than you have\n Comment: 🤣🤣🤣\n Comment: r/donthelpjustfilm\n Comment: As many as it wants\n Comment: Winks as good as a nod to a blind man\n Comment: And get Chipotle\n Comment: TIL!  Thanks\n Comment: Exactly. Everyone saying “hurr durr America dumb” is an idiot. America has some of the strictest regulations around sea turtles. Many local jurisdictions have separate regulations just for them, even for non-endangered species. Basically every dive shop has warnings not to touch the turtles etc\n\nThat said, yeah videos of people riding these turtles do occur (even outside the US) but people usually get arrested and fined promptly. You’re gonna see a video every few years but justice is swift.\n Comment: To my knowledge 90% of sea turtle in the nesting in the continental US occurs in Florida so that’s where the majority of the laws are. There are scattered sea turtle nesting sites in almost every state bordering the Atlantic south of Virginia but I don’t think there are any in Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana\n Comment: Fucking Florida…\n Comment: Ah my fellow Americans…what fuckwits. And of course! Florida!\n Comment: Yes, it is true. I don’t know what’s wrong with people. Everyone is far too needy for attention.\n Comment: to*\n Comment: Way to generalize an entire country.\n\nI bet you also think everyone in Israel is money obsessed and that everyone in Afghanistan has bombs strapped to their chests.\n Comment: I mean... you *are* the one to remember the changes...\n Comment: Red headed journalist\n Comment: And the orgy\n Comment: How else do you take fight selfies?\n Comment: Same. Can't read or write or press buttons properly. I keep trying over and over. Sometimes this causes me to realize that I'm Dreaming then I can actively control my dream.\n Comment: >trying to send back soup in a deli\n\nNo soup for you!\n Comment: Yeah this comment shows the difference, don't know why people are getting hung up on you over this when you're right, it's still huge (and largest recorded isn't far off to be honest) but these clips always gain more traction the more the perspective is forced because it just seems more impressive, weirdly not the first time I've seen this with other turtle videos specifically too.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ypj4ty/-/ivjpu9r\n Comment: I thought it just looked like an adult one. I see how people could be confused or ignorant on the sizes of some random animals.\n Comment: Yes, the perspective [at the begining](https://i.imgur.com/TqSUGQe.png) and [at the end](https://i.imgur.com/4QgU2FO.png) paint very different pictures.\n Comment: She.

Have fun with this shit for fucks sake.\n Comment: Not the first time it was recreated because he was also on a Tosh.O episode.\n Comment: I didn't want to like it but I loved it.\n Comment: lol his face is the same\n Comment: I think of the original video at least a few times a week\n Comment: Does anyone else think that someone in marketing suggested they drop the poster in the background at the last second so people like me would go into the comments to point out the falling poster and drive their engagement up?\n Comment: Is that really the same guy?\n Comment: Good to see this guy has a sense of humor about it, unlike the Star Wars kid.\n Comment: How did they even track that dude down?\n Comment: Haha legend\n Comment: Wow, this was one of my favorite memes back in the day. Awesome that they got him back for this, something it perfectly fits for.\n Comment: This makes me want to see the film\n Comment: As a 37 year old man, TMNT is one of the few things I never grew out if.

Dude finally got his payday.\n Comment: since the studios can't use actors they have to get a little more creative than usual for their marketing. I hope some weird and funny things will come from that!\n Comment: I hope they paid him well for this, this is great.\n Comment: Personally thought this was kinda pandery. I can see some marketing execs sitting around clapping each other on the back for taking a funny moment from life that became a meme and making it more literal to advertise their Summer blockbuster release. Nauseating\n Comment: Best part of the movie\n Comment: Idk man - crossing the picket lines there\n Comment: Now that's fucking marketing💪💪💪💪💪🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢\n Comment: Kinda cringe actually\n Comment: Is this because this guy is not part of SAG, so studios can hire him to promote the movie?\n Comment: They should have used Darby Allin.\n Comment: No idea what this is\n Comment: god this is the Steve Buscemi meme \"hey fellow kids\"\n\nhate when large corporations try to appeal to younger people\n Comment: Feel like this was a missed opportunity to subvert expectations and have him go into a long winded review of the movie.\n Comment: Not satisfied with remaking every old movie any more, Hollywood is now starting to remake tired old memes.\n Comment: How much does Paramount pay to make shitty reddit posts?\n Comment: A+ to the marketers\n Comment: Guess my adblocker isn't working\n Comment: Ahh I got third degree cringe from that.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Cringe.

I can't be the only one that realizes it.\n Comment: This coulda been fun instead just a poor execution.\n Comment: so... do we actually need to watch this movie to know it sucks ?\n Comment: Wait that’s not Darby Allin?\n Comment: Zombie scabs now, huh?\n\nEdit: lol lotta mad people downvoting this. Maybe dude doesn’t care because he’s not an actor or influencer or doesn’t work in the film industry, but he’s still promoting a movie when there’s 2 unions on strike. Which makes him a scab. Unless this was filmed before the strike, but there’s no way to know unless they say it.\n Comment: Probably sounded like a really good idea on paper…\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Mega cringe\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: It was dumb then and it's dumb now.\n Comment: Nice catch!\n Comment: She kicks ass in Shredder's Revenge\n Comment: Too bad the new movie didn’t do that as well.\n Comment: I hope he got a FAT check\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: The money is in the memes nowadays!

That's why there's an awkward pause right at the end.\n Comment: 😂\n Comment: He fused with Sting\n Comment: I appreciate this reference\n Comment: So glad I stumbled upon this comment\n Comment: Thank you\n Comment: It's not. Just did some internet sleuthing and the original reporter was Nancy Francis with Portland's KGW News. Nancy left the news biz back in 2009, she's now a professor (as Nancy Copic) at the University of Portland. They either didn't ask her or she turned them down, maybe because she's not in news anymore.\n Comment: If it isn't, I'm rioting\n Comment: No thats April\n Comment: This sub really needs post approval\n Comment: I think theres a word for this\n Comment: Eh, their account isn't as bad as I expected. It looks more like someone who just happens to read a lot of Deadline and THR. And, in fact, they engage in a lot of discussions about entertainment as an industry.\n\nCould they have been tapped by a marketing team to post this? Sure.\n\nBut their top post of all time is an article calling for an end to the entertainment industry's grueling hours. I'd hardly call that shilling.\n Comment: This is cool though so ok\n Comment: Does anyone here even want to watch this TMNT movie?\n Comment: He may not have even realized that. I certainly didn't think about it.\n Comment: Unless they filmed ahead of the strike\n Comment: I have a feeling the April dressed reporter is more likely the aspiring actress of the two.\n Comment: You don’t know when this was filmed either. Could’ve been before the strike.\n Comment: Can't blame the guy for getting that bag.\n Comment: We don’t know *when* this was filmed. Promotional material is often created months prior to a film opening.\n Comment: Keep an eye on your favorite Youtubers. I guarantee they're going to be courted for promos right now, and Youtubers are perfect prey because they've got no union and are notorious for having few work boundaries. And plenty are desperate.\n Comment: Oh shut up\n Comment: He's not an actor so he's not a scab.\n Comment: What is a scab in this context\n Comment: He isn't a scab, because he didn't cross the line or take anyone's job.\n Comment: my first thought tbh, \"soooo when was this filmed?\"\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I thought the strike allowed promo work for stuff that they were already in contract for before the strike.  \nIt would be kind of dumb for everyone to throw a ton of work they already did into the garbage.\n Comment: Oh gfy\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Bruh fuck that, this dude is probably working a 9-5 making middle income like the rest of us. Studio probably paid him equivalent of a year’s salary for this, I’m taking that money in a fucking heartbeat. Mark Ruffalo isn’t paying my damn mortgage.\n Comment: Which applies to most commercial actors since ads are usually non union work. \n\nSo basically any commercial that comes out ever is scab work tbh\n Comment: https://youtu.be/PcGwkyzmPmA\n Comment: Scabs will never be allowed to join SAG. I hope he did have acting inspirations, because he’s blacklisted from union work forever.\n Comment: This entire community is scabbing. I'm honestly pretty disappointed that the mods have no solidarity with the striking writers and actors - we're still getting 'first picture of film x' and 'exclusive image' posts all the time. Every single one of those is promotion for struck work - paid or not I'd really like to see the mods here take a stand on this sort of content while the strike is going on.\n\nThis sub should be supporting the writers and actors, not the studios looking to hold onto their pay checks and replace them with AI models.\n Comment: Ehhhh wouldn't be have to be part of the union for it to matter?\n\nThink about the nonsense of that logic.\n\nAh Joe, we've got a big movie role for you and...\n\nWait.... John did you do a tv news interview at a movie during the strike 20 years ago? Your career is over.\n Comment: I was hoping someone else remembered this, didn’t that show have a viral meme redemption kind of thing? I remember they brought this kid on, painted his face like a turtle, and gave him a chance to say what he really wanted to say on national television, only for him to say, “I like zombies”\n Comment: I can’t hear the word “turtle” without thinking of it\n Comment: I read somewhere that he was not pleased and embarrassed with the overall result of the segment.\n Comment: [\"and yes, it is, in fact, the same Jonathan\"](https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-found-zombie-turtle-kid-best-viral-marketing-ever)\n Comment: That’s a him.\n Comment: He really does look like Darby Allin\n Comment: Jesus christ\n Comment: >him or her\n\nThem is also a word that exists\n Comment: Him or her?\n Comment: You are allowed to say \"him\" lmao. Jesus christ, reddit.\n Comment: Part of what makes memes so memorable and timeless are the ability of the subject involved being spontaneously awkward and unbeknownst at that moment of fame. While it’s nice for someone to embrace their meme in the time after, them acting the very same meme that got them famous doesn’t hit hard the second time around.\n\nSimpsons already did this trope with Bart and ‘do whatever you feel.’\n Comment: Hmm. Wonder why it doesn’t hit the same note? In theory it should hit the exact same note\n Comment: That chicks got a dick sir\n Comment: This “him or her” “inclusivity” bullshit is retarded\n Comment: Why are you assuming they are binary?\n Comment: Maybe he's a her now\n Comment: I thought the same, but then I rewatched it and the poster falling last second was the chef's kiss 😙👌\n Comment: Well he is a great zombie 🧟‍♂️\n Comment: His acting could have been a tad better\n Comment: Screw SAG thinking they can boss anyone around, especially youtube personalities…It’s laughable.\n Comment: Internet viral video from (16 years ago).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CMNry4PE93Y\n\nLocal fair. Kid dressed as a zombie. Asked how he likes the fair. Responds simply \"i like turtles.\"\n\nInternet loves it and it goes viral.\n Comment: Ad creators aren't *that* creative. Also average audience wouldn't get it.\n Comment: This isn’t the The Last Jedi so we’re good\n Comment: You’re talking out your ass and regurgitating the same ol arguments that has been debunked so many times.\n Comment: How would one invest both time and energy in ‘meme culture’?\n Comment: I like turtles\n Comment: Like you wouldn’t get that bag if offered\n Comment: That's usually how most things work. Experience it and make that decision for yourself.\n\nBut if you believe early reviews are in and it's being well received.\n Comment: Do you think he honestly knows? Do you think he cares?\n\nIt could have been filmed before strike, and even if it wasn’t, I doubt the dude gives a fuck or knows.\n\nJust like I wouldn’t give a fuck if I was offered a big pay check for a role.\n\nJust like YOU would become this scab if offered the right price.\n\nThis whole thread of scab talk is hilarious.\n Comment: A kid movie with kid advertisement with a fun concept and light hearted attempt to make something idk…fun? Is corny huh? Ok.\n Comment: I’ve never played that with someone and that person *didn’t* have a blast. A loving tribute to brawling games!\n Comment: It's free on the Netflix app! Crazy way to save $25\n Comment: I mean, the new April still has the signature yellow coat, so the outfits are pretty close.\n Comment: You know she was originally not even a reporter, right? She was actually Baxter Stockman's lab assistant. Her original outfit wasn't the yellow jumpsuit it was a blue 80s style leather jacket with a big red scarf.\n\nSince you CARE SO MUCH about staying true to the original I figure I should at least let you know what the original was.\n Comment: Probably not.\n Comment: I’d be blown away if he got more than a grand for this\n Comment: Why did I read this as, “I hope he got a FAT chick”?\n Comment: $200 for his likeness in perpetuity /s\n Comment: Doubt\n Comment: Lol they bought him in because of the SAG AFTRA strike preventing actors from promoting. So this meme sucks\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Classic Demetri.\n Comment: Its bad enough saying you like one of them, so why did you like 5?\n Comment: *R Kelly frown intensifies*\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: 🗿\n Comment: It was really weird when Rick wakes up from the coma and there are already quite decomposing zombies around (like the bicycle girl) and then the show goes on for years and somehow the zombies keep keeping fresh enough.\n Comment: I don’t think it’s an accident as it also happens in the original video. Everything is recreated pretty perfectly right down to the outfits of the people in the background.\n Comment: How you know?\n Comment: He fused with ~~Sting~~ Mr. Stink\n Comment: Okay now where's Bin Laden?\n Comment: The reporter is Jamie Stelter of NY1 news.  Not actually a news lady, but a gadfly who natters incessantly during the morning show on NY1\n Comment: This was so informative, I thought for sure it was going to end with Mankind flying through a table.\n Comment: Eagle eye over here\n Comment: If this was in Portland Oregon, now it makes all the sense in the world.\n Comment: Cheers Nancy\n Comment: I am familiar with the production designer on this through other work they do; they are a member of SAG and have been picketing. Likely this either was shot and filmed prior to the strike, or it does not apply.\n Comment: Why would he. He’s got bills to pay and probably works a median income job. Why should he give a shit if some writers and actors with $200k+ median incomes are fighting with their bosses, the actors and writers don’t think about him. They aren’t paying his mortgage. I wouldn’t lose a wink of sleep over crossing the picket line. This promo probably earned him some real money, maybe $10-40k, could provide some real financial security. The average American has no savings.\n Comment: Doubt it\n Comment: I like money\n Comment: Yes you can. Scabs are scabs no matter how much they get paid, fuck this dude.\n Comment: Still a scab but it won't affect him.\n\nIf UPS drivers went on strike and I, an aerospace technician, went and did a few deliveries for UPS as just a one-off thing then I'd still be a scab.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Scab is a derogatory term for someone who is hired to fill in for striking workers\n Comment: scab refers to someone taking a job opening when the people that otherwise would have held that job are on strike.\n\nwhich is completely fucking stupid in this context because it implies that they where going to hire some rando to say these 3 words but then that guy went on strike so instead they sought out the guy who the entire video is centered around and is literally the sole reason for them to bother making this reference and that guy, I guess, stole food off the table of the *other* nameless face that should have instead stood there and said \"I like turtles\".\n Comment: A “scab” is someone who crosses a picket line, literally or figuratively, to do work striking workers won’t do. \n\nSo because SAG actors are striking and not promoting any productions they’ve done, anyone who does that is a scab.\n Comment: Him doing this weakens (even though very slightly) the position of the actors and writers on strike.\n Comment: Someone who supports unions and doesn’t like the idea of production studios getting non-union members to fill in for the actors during a strike?\n Comment: Lol I doubt he made anything more than a few hundred dollars for this.\n Comment: Yeah, I'm pretty confused by this myself.\n[SAG-AFTRA is already pretty hard to get into](https://www.sagaftra.org/membership-benefits/steps-join) because it requires pretty strict pre-reqs. As you mentioned, most commercials are done by non-union already and many people do non union commercial work because the union won't let them in. So this is like saying the union that won't let you in is going to punish you for the work they already weren't allowed to do (i.e., a non-union gig). If it was supposed to be a union gig, and he filled the union role because they were on strike, obviously a different story, but it was a commercial and it was the kids character, so I doubt it.\n Comment: Yeah the Web Redemptions were hilarious.\n Comment: Neat.\n Comment: Mario!\n Comment: I feel ONE MILLION years old.\n Comment: Darby only half likes turtles.\n Comment: These people are unhinged\n Comment: https://youtu.be/Zt5qJC1xQ8A\n\nHe... OR SHE\n Comment: Yesterday we said hello to one of our neighbors and when we got inside my 5yo says “I couldn’t tell if that was a boy or a girl.” And I was like “that’s called androgynous, you can just say they or them if you’re not sure.” And my kid was like “oh ok !” \n\nIt’s really that simple lol just defer to they/them if you’re not sure of someone’s pronouns\n\nEdit: I think it’s very funny that someone reported this comment to the Reddit personal crisis team. The only crisis here is the hatefulness that folks carry towards people just being themselves.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Op’s comment was grammatically sound, and you still felt the need to say this\n Comment: I agree with you,  him and her,  and it\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Downvoting me doesn’t make me wrong assholes.\n Comment: I'm not sure how you got that from my basic post. I haven't got the sense that SAG has been bullying youtubers. I *have* heard that some Twitch streamers backed out of streams sponsored by films because streamers were SAG members.\n\nTo elaborate, because SAG is on strike and its actor members cannot promote their films, studios are turning to more interesting (and non-union) ways to promote their films. Like Paramount finding the \"I Like Turtles\" guy to promote a Ninja Turtles movie.\n Comment: Lol what\n Comment: What exactly has been “debunked”? Because this guy is stating a 100% fact. Most movies are remakes or sequels\n Comment: \"DeBuNkEd!!\"\n\nWhat the fuck are you even saying?\n Comment: Lack of personality, hobbies or ability to go outside\n Comment: This entire thread is AstroTurf\n Comment:  Often, but not always, the people that are very vocal about those small differences are upset about *other* changes but don't want to be say so in public so they instead harp on tiny details that no one cares about.\n Comment: I was more referencing the fact that she never used to be a chunky weirdo.\n Comment: While she wasn't black, she didn't exactly look white either. Seemed more latina than anything.\n\nAll that to say the April character has undergone changes as the story had been retold.\n Comment: I always get a chuckle when people try to force their erroneous point with all caps. Thanks for that haha\n Comment: Well I hope he got a FAT WAD OF CASH instead\n Comment: I hope he got a mutually agreed upon fee that all parties were happy with.\n Comment: Why not? I'm sure they paid him well for this\n Comment: Why $1000?\n Comment: Your subconscious is telling you what you truly desire.\n Comment: \"Fat bottom checks..they make the rockin' world go round.\"\n Comment: why not both?\n Comment: Projection is not usually intentional\n Comment: Because you wish the best for people.\n Comment: Holy shit, I did too and was highly confused.\n Comment: Zombie Turtle Kid Expanded Universe\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: A stone cold classic\n Comment: That's a pretty entertaining comment. Thanks 256!\n Comment: 😂\n Comment: I like how the zombies wait silently behind trees for inconsequential characters to get too close\n Comment: that one in particular got attacked by a a whole herd so her state makes sense, later in atlanta you see a bunch of zombies and they aren’t too decomposed. tho arguably they should be since its set in georgia in the summer\n Comment: It always bugged me how there's always giant hordes of them for years and years. If every person kills an average of 20 zombies a year (mind you, it's closer to 20 per episode), you're going to run out real fast\n Comment: What? You thought every walker was from the beginning of the apocalypse? Any human that dies comes back as a walker. People die all the time, dude.\n Comment: I'm glad someone's pointing out the scientific inaccuracies in a show about the undead.\n Comment: What are you talking about? The original video doesn't even have a wall.\n Comment: are you sure about that? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y\n Comment: Oh it's in the original, too? I stand corrected.\n Comment: Leedle keed\n Comment: Sleeping with the fishes.\n Comment: The production designer isn’t SAG unless they are an actor as well. IATSE, which embodies all the crew unions, is not on strike. Maybe they are picketing in solidarity but writers and actors are the film people currently on strike.\n Comment: That's because you're a scab though.\n\nI thought that way when I was 13 and didn't understand how systems actually work to keep all workers desperate and struggling and that the only way to defeat those systems is to work together and not undercut each other to help billionaires make more millions each year, continually destroying the middle class or quality of life in America, just so that you can pay off your car 6 months sooner. \n\nMaybe you'll grow out of it too.\n Comment: Downvoted, but you're right -- if they filmed ahead of the strike, it likely would have been with some of the acting talent. This is similar to what some of the companies did during comic-con. Promote themselves and movies with non-actors because of the same reasons.\n\nThis type of marketing does really feel like \"we don't have actors, someone google turtle meme and see if we can do something\"\n Comment: Do you think he's aware of what's going on? It's almost certainly they reached out to him and he was like \"cool\" and gave it no more thought than that. Not everything is some huge deal we need to be furious about.\n Comment: How is he a scab? Who were they going to hire to play the role of “turtle-loving zombie kid” if not the actual guy from the original video? Daniel Day-Lewis?\n Comment: You're such a fuckin idiot, it was probably filmed weeks or months ago\n Comment: This is a \"why are you booing me? I'm right\" moment lol\n Comment: You would\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Your massive overreaction to this is going to have the opposite effect of what you intend.\n Comment: Or maybe it's allowed?\n Comment: Can’t believe you’re being downvoted. The state of class consciousness in the us is really fucking depressing\n Comment: Scabs do not deserve respect nor human decency\n Comment: If he's not really trying to be an actor though, does it still count?\n Comment: The purpose of any strike is to figuratively bleed the company dry so they meet demands of the union. If you go work for the company you’re a scab. Let them bleed!!!!\n\n*Edit* We are talking about the definition of a ‘scab’. This is not a comment about the validity of scabs.\n Comment: lol, derogatory, okay corpo bootlickers\n\nEDIT: what is 'derogatory' about it? They're literally the ones stopping other artists from making more money\n Comment: Someone who goes against the hivemind\n Comment: How dare you\n\nDaniel Day Lewis lived as an eight year old for seventeen months to prepare himself for this role before the strike\n Comment: I don't think it's stupid in this context.\n\nIt doesn't matter if they came up with a new sketch specifically for \"zombie kid\", it's still a studio hiring non union actors to appear in a sketch that very likely was not part of the marketing plan before the strike.\n Comment: No, the actors are supposed to be promoting their movie, but they can't because they're on strike, and not promoting the movie will likely lose the studio money. If the Turtle kid had already recorded his lines before the strike, then it's fine, but if they hired him to promote the movie while the strike is going on so that they can market their movie without using the actors, then that guy is technically a scab.\n Comment: He's not promoting a production he has done.\n Comment: Nah. \n\nIt would be weakened of they used the original without the dudes input.\n Comment: Defaulting to \"them\" for anyone whose gender/pronouns I don't already know has actually been such a relief. Especially at work if emailing with someone in another country who has a name I've never heard of before. I hear coworkers struggle with the gender game, asking other people who have also never met this person, \"Do you know if Bao is a man or a woman?!\" \n\n\"Who cares? *They* botched that report either way.\"\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Ong\n Comment: The 100% fact is that that dude likes turtles\n Comment: Talking out your ass, there’s plenty of new stuff out there you simply don’t watch it. \nBetween the ungodly amount of streaming platforms “Hollywood” isn’t the only source of films and entertainment. \n\nTubi alone has a crap ton of unique films.\n Comment: Reading comprehension not the best huh?\n Comment: Oh, I know, I'm just waiting for them to go mask-off and say it with their full chest instead of just tiptoeing around it\n\nedit: [lol, there we go](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/15cmdjd/i_like_turtles_zombie_kid_is_brought_back_from/ju0hw1t?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)\n Comment: April was originally black/Hispanic looking in the first comics.

It's hard to get into it when nearly every zombie death is so easily preventable. Like a guy just standing on an open road shooting at a horde of zombies coming from one direction and he drops his ammo and stumbles around on the floor trying to pick it up for like a minute as the horde slowly crawls to him and they end up biting him. It's 100% like this scene from Austin Powers. https://youtu.be/l4UFQWKjy_I\n Comment: The only thing that would make it work is that there are other little communities here and there and suddenly they collapse and they all turn.\n Comment: price toothbrush squeeze intelligent whole gullible simplistic pet placid rainstorm\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n Comment: Of over 300 million?! Yeah, you’ll run out of ammo real fast\n Comment: Who the fuck is mowing the grass?!!\n Comment: Its not scientific innacuarcy that is the problem, its an internal logical consistency complaint.\n\nOne of the very first things they established about the zombies was that they are dead and still rotting. Rick wasnt in a coma very long and we see some pretty decayed zombies, yet none of them have decayed further in the literal decades of time progression\n\nStories without logical consistency are just clusterfucks\n Comment: Mandela effect\n Comment: People just be making shit up\n Comment: No need to stand, it wasn't in the original\n Comment: Working for Meester Stink\n Comment: Crazy to think he could even TAKE a trip to sea world given his infamy...\n Comment: “Hey, I thought you said he was dead!”, “No, I said bin Laden sleeps with the fishes”\n Comment: They are, I did say they were a member of SAG, didn't I?\n Comment: He said “other work they do.” Production designers are in local 600 - but you know that people can have more than one job, right?\n Comment: Such a shallow, thoughtless take: “So you can pay off your car 6 months sooner”\n\nPeople have rent and food to take care of. Your statement implies you have never had to worry about where your next meal comes from. So either you’re the teenager, or you’re an upperclass, soapbox socialist. All theory and no experience. \n\nIn either case, vilifying members of the working class because they can’t afford to not work is so out-of-touch with reality. The systems of control have become complex enough that participation in certain collective actions cannot be undertaken without some amount of privilege. That privilege can and should be used for good (I agree that SAG should strike), but it’s not a ruler to measure your dick as a real socialist. It just makes you look like an asshat.\n Comment: No, you’re not understanding how union solidarity works. It has to be reciprocal. SAG is only supporting its own in Hollywood. They aren’t part of the international brotherhood or any other broader labor organizations. They don’t give a shit about average people. They will never strike in solidarity with teamsters or railroad workers (see: what happened earlier this year) or any other union. So why should we sacrifice for them?\n\nI’m not rooting for the Hollywood bosses, but these guys aren’t a real union. It’s s private club that is only looking out for itself and doesn’t give a damn about any other union or labor interests.\n Comment: Why wouldn't they use a recognizable internet meme about turtles to promote a movie about turtles?\n Comment: *Not everything is some huge deal we need to be furious about.*\n\nDo you know where you are?\n Comment: Is it still \"being a scab\" if you have nothing to do with sag but do a commercial or other acting gig? I don't know the rules of such things\n Comment: They shouldn't have the luxury of hiring anyone. Anyone who promotes films or works on a production during a full strike is a scab.\n Comment: he crossed a picket line to work that is the definition of a scab\n Comment: Your boos mean nothing to me, I've seen what makes you cheer!\n Comment: Nope.\n Comment: I literally do not care about Reddit internet points.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: If he’s not trying to be an actor it still counts, but it probably won’t have a major impact on his life.\n\nIf he WAS trying to be an actor then this could bar him from that future.\n Comment: Yes, it counts. Scabbing is when anyone comes in and does striked work. If all the servers in the country went on strike, and cooks started serving, that would be scabbing.\n Comment: If he's being paid to do anything the union would normally do and is refusing to do, then yes.  Basically, is he making life easier for management during a strike, and getting paid for it?  That's a scab.\n Comment: It does not count. People just have no idea what they are talking about. It would only count if he did acting. Just as character performers at disney are not considered to be scabs when disney has them show up to premiers.\n Comment: He is being hired to fulfill a role that is being denied to the studio by the striking workers (i.e. promoting a film), so yes it does count.\n Comment: Why should this guy, an average dude likely making middle income somewhere around $60k/ye, give up anything for some actors and writers making $200k+ when those actors and writers do not give a damn about him? If you’re in a union that is striking in solidarity with another union, sure - but that comes with the assumption of reciprocity. The factory mechanics strike in solidarity with the line workers even if they’re in different unions, and vice versa. SAG has never struck in solidarity with any real labor union, they care only for their own and the other Hollywood types. Otherwise they look down their noses at the rest of us and would spit on us if they had the chance.\n\nNow, I’m not rooting for the Hollywood bosses either. But there’s no heroes here and I would not give up a shinny penny for their cause if given the chance. This guy is likely getting paid a live altering amount of money (probably mid-5-figures), and this is his one chance to make a buck. Why should he pass that up for people who don’t think about him at all?\n Comment: It is derogatory. No one says \"scab\" with a positive connotation.\n Comment: And he's also not an actor\n Comment: Yes, that's the whole point of a scab.\n Comment: Is this a new thing to most people? I learned about this in English class when I was 12, and I've never stepped foot in an English speaking country.\n Comment: But Hollywood is what the guy you downvoted is talking about. So, apparently, you’re the only talking out of your ass\n Comment: God damn. \n\nI think I speak for us all when I say,\n\n[You make my high come down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC9opZHx0Nw)\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I have it on good authority that he likes turtles.\n Comment: I mean, that's just about every job ever, ESPECIALLY jobs that are artistic in nature or otherwise have people working there because they love the work. Employers when they see that their employees love their jobs get dollar signs in their eyes knowing the abuse they can heap on them and still keep them around.\n Comment: This is social media marketing which has very big budgets now. If he had any sort of representation at all, he could have made 25k, 50k, or more.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I did a commercial for AAA last year for a model friend that needed someone to do it with her. They paid me $600 and I was on set for maybe 45 minutes. Wouldn’t be surprised if he made $1K or more, especially since they were paying for his likeness and not getting some random person to do it.\n Comment: Hypothetical situation here. Paramount pays you $500 for an hour of your time at your local theater. You show up, get a quick makeup job, stand there for 10 seconds, recite the meme you're famous for, and go home. You wouldn't take it?\n\nObviously I have no clue how much he was paid or what agreement they had, but that sounds like easy money to me.\n Comment: I assume he also got a flight/hotel unless he is local to where they did it.\n Comment: What about the FIVE-HOUR makeup?\n Comment: But that's not how anything works.\n\nYou have to factor is the fact that this guy probably has a family now, that he would have needed to travel and potentially stay overnight somewhere for the filming, take time off work, away from family, and that he might not really want to be famous or have his face shown everywhere.\n\nYou also have to factor in the budget for the campaign, how important having the same guy involved is to the marketing team etc\n\nDistilling it down to 'an hours work' is missing a lot of context.\n\nSo yeah, he probably got closer to 5-10k.\n Comment: Inconceivable!\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Go ahead and stop fear now. Legit some of the worst seasons of tv I’ve ever seen are later. \n\nTerrible writing only gets worse.\n Comment: I got about as far as you before I sort of lost interest. I actually do want to go back to it though.\n\nI was trying to get back into the original when I got to an episode where they’re leading a bunch of zombies with trucks or something. They stop to have a conversation in a forest and as soon as they’re done a zombie pops out like a ninja and takes some guy out. It was like a huge grove of spruce trees or something, the kind of forest you can see a long way in every direction\n Comment: It's hard to get into it? You're two seasons in!\n Comment: I always loved how they immediately get out and run the rest of the way.\n Comment: Something like that would also allow for the writer to have the main characters visit said community, then later see fresh zombie that they recognize. You could even have an arc of the story where they just don't see any zombies for a while besides ones stuck on the ground deteriorating. Then the focus can be on rebuilding, only for a fresh hoard to catch them unprepared. \n\nI get that the main role of zombies is as a stand-in for societal critique, but I do wish the mechanics of said zombies got some focus more often. The story often tends to start after the fall, or right as everything cascades out of control. A more slow-burn situation where the outbreak starts in Washington DC and New York which massively destabilizes the country (or any country you choose), but there's still some semblance of normalcy elsewhere could be interesting. Maybe have a group that outright denies the outbreak is happening? Might be too on-the-nose.\n Comment: there's more guns in america than there are people, i'm a thousand percent sure you'd never run out of ammo lol\n Comment: Zombies switched to vegetarianism to survive.\n Comment: Walking dead is a soap opera with extra makeup on\n Comment: exactly, if the zombies just ***didn't*** decay, and all looked like perfectly preserved people forever. OK, makes internal sense, one you become a zombie you never rot.\n\nand if they decayed into slop on the ground and slowly fell apart over time. OK, makes internal sense, decay still happens at ***some*** sort of consistent rate.\n\nbut to decay until \"enough rot to look scary\" and then stopping, that doesn't even make internal sense.\n\nand internal sense is the lowest bar I can stomach before it turns into stupid or a cartoon.\n Comment: I'm sorry, you're going to have to explain to me how literally all zombie movies/shows work differently than TWD. \n\nI'm not sure an argument of him being in a coma for a month is a good one for quick decomposition of zombies. This is Atlanta Georgia, which if you're not familiar with the climate, gets fairly hot. By a month, corpses in real life have begun to liquefy.\n\n>none of them have decayed further in the literal decades of time progression\n\nIn other words, you're arguing about the scientific inaccuracies of a show about the undead. What is inconsistent about it? Unless you can show me where zombies quickly decay beyond the ability to support their bodies, the show is pretty consistent that the bodies decay quickly in a cosmetic sense, but never lose function.\n Comment: Nowadays you don’t need to do that, just get a Logitech controller and metal cylinder and call it a day!\n Comment: He likes fish sticks.\n Comment: Friend is a location scout : they’re in their own union with directors, producers, designers etc…they are not on strike (but effectively out of work due to the strikes), but are in a totally different union then the writers and actors.\n Comment: Sounds like something a scab would say\n Comment: Tell me you don’t understand striking without saying you don’t understand striking\n Comment: They could! I work in ent journalism and this is just a pattern that I'm seeing, so it's a hunch I have.\n Comment: On Reddit where the average age demographic is 14 years old?\n Comment: Scabs don't tend to be in the relevant union, because the relevant union is on strike. Scabs are just workers who come in and fill the job while other workers are trying to strike. In this case, it's quite possible he was not aware that he was being used as a scab (assuming this was filmed after the strike began), but that doesn't stop him from being a scab.\n\n\"Scab workers\" aren't always necessarily jerks as individuals, but a company who hires scab workers is defying the demands of workers for better conditions. So, even if we don't hold this individual personally responsible, we can still call out the use of scab labor as harmful.\n Comment: Yes, scabs can be non-union people brought in to do jobs where a union member is typically used \n\nIn this case, if he has a speaking role and he's doing it in front of a screen, he's doing SAG work and he is scabbing\n Comment: You should care about being wrong. This wasn't even filmed after the strike began.\n Comment: >Studios Allegedly Won’t End Strike Till Writers “Start Losing Their Apartments”\n\nNo human decency for scabs.\n Comment: From SAG-AFTRA, the strike includes promoting releases from struck production companies\n\nFrom what I gather, it would be scabbing, though what really matters is if the guy is doing this knowing that or if he was tricked by Paramount.\n Comment: Well if they filmed this during the strike. Then yes. But if this was filmed before the strike. Then, I'm sure it won't have any impact on him or anybody else involved either.\n Comment: Isnt he a teenager? You're telling me the union is so fucked that they'll turn down someone for making a mistake as a teen?\n Comment: Actors dont hire other actors, if anything you are more likely to be hired by the producer if they know you wont whine and strike about pay. This is what has happened in all other strikes.\n Comment: Who is he replacing? Were they going to get an actor to play a meme kid from 16 years ago.\n Comment: Typed all this to look dumb as fuck, nice\n Comment: Bro, we were talking about the definition of “scab”. What are you on?\n Comment: Please tell me that you don't actually think the average is 200k lmao you are absolutely clueless... go read how less than 10% of them clear 30k a year. Do some research before you write a paragraph in ignorance.\n Comment: is there a possible positive connotation?\n\nEDIT: shit is shit. scabs are scabs.\n Comment: A scab in context would be doing the work a striking person isn’t doing. If construction workers are striking, anyone working at that site is a scab. If teamsters are striking, anyone driving the trucks is a scab. The definition of a scab is literally a person brought in to replace striking workers. They do not need to from the same profession/union.\n Comment: You are missing the main point here.  It's not about technicalities.  It's about how he is taking the job of someone who is on strike, which weakens the positions of the strikers looking for better pay.  \n\nDo you really not understand that?\n\n(also wtf are you talking about, he is an actor, because in this clip, he is playing a character...his child self.  For pay (probably).  AKA acting.  The fact that this is not his actual occupation is irrelevant.  This is not the sincere reaction he would naturally have had if someone asked him about the turtles movie).\n Comment: It's a nuance of English, at least in America. \n\nIf you have no idea of a person's identity, it's far more common to refer to them as they. If you know their name or they are part of your network in some capacity, there seems to be a colloquial insistence on getting their gender accurate. Like if you say, \"Myung finished their task,\" there seems to be a disconnect for most Americans. \n\nYou already know their name. Why wouldn't you know their gender? \n\nIt's not a law of the language or anything, just something I've noticed when paying attention in office life.\n Comment: In the US, I was taught as a kid that they was plural and not to use it as singular. Some of us did anyway e.g. if we didn’t know an author’s gender, but the teacher wanted us to use he or she.\n\nIt’s definitely changed now, though\n Comment: You’re still talking out your ass, plenty of new main stream or “Hollywood” movies out there along with shows but you just don’t watch them. \n\nYou people really don’t get it which is why unique shows don’t survive and movies don’t get made because you don’t watch them. \n\nYou like to be force fed and get mad when it starts tasting the same, can’t help you.\n Comment: Well it’s not really a myth that people think she looks that way, which is what I said.  One creator said he intended her to be mixed race.  The other said he didn’t really think about it and just thought she was white.  The cartoon kind of came out shortly after and then she was definitively white.  \n\nIt’s more like there wasn’t a lot of thought about her because she was a side character.  They’ve come out and said pretty much that.\n Comment: Man, it almost seems like we should regulate businesses so that they don't abuse and destroy the working class.\n Comment: One of the great gems of wisdom from Malcolm in the Middle when Malcolm gets a housesitting job and asks his mom how much they'll pay him and she says \"the same thing every job will: not as much as you're worth, but just enough to keep you crawling back\"\n Comment: Talmbout 13 hour days working in fast food for 13.75 an hour\n Comment: 1. The vast majority of Hollywood actors aren't multi-millionaires.\n\n2. No one *has* to have any job.\n\n3. By not siding with the strikers, you're effectively \"feeling bad\" for the multi-billion dollar corporations. They're more than capable of paying people enough to make a living, so why shouldn't they?\n Comment: This comment confuses me. Your friend is female but they're paying for HIS likeness? Can't parse this.\n Comment: $500 seems more than reasonable as well. That’s why I said more than $1000 would blow me away.\n Comment: If I was the studio I’d just do it local to wherever the guy lives. This isn’t a tough shoot.\n Comment: You think that makeup took 5 hours?\n Comment: Or they shot in his hometown and hired a local actress, makeup artist, and camera guy for $2500 to shoot the whole bit for under $5000 because this shoot is literally just recreating a news spot.\n\nAlso, since this guy is a meme, I’m not sure having the exact same guy is actually important. The whole ad could be about how people love the movie and love the meme.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: TWD franchise died with Carl imo\n Comment: GRAAAAAIIINNS\n Comment: Pretty much how I think about it and if I remember correctly the book *World War Z* got into how climate affected zombies. How in the areas with a cold climate the zombies almost went dormant/became very slow/almost a non issue in the winter and made it easy to try to clear as many away as possible before the warm months. And in the warm/humid places they'd be pretty active but decay very quickly.\n Comment: >This is Atlanta Georgia, which if you're not familiar with the climate, gets fairly hot. By a month, corpses in real life have begun to liquefy.\n\nIn The Walking Dead corpses don't come back to life if they weren't infected before they died. If you have a decayed moving zombie it was infected before it died and then decayed. Do you not remember the bicycle girl which is the first walker that Rick killed cuz she was half a body crawling around that the rest of had decayed. In the month of rick's coma a zombie decayed so much it's fucking legs fell off\n\nI'm arguing about internal consistency because there was a period in which zombies decayed for and then suddenly that all stops despite decades passing and never is mentioned or dealt with again\n\nYour whole point about the Cosmetic Decay only happening is literally refuted by the first episode which is what my point is, again the first undead Rick deals with is pretty fucking decayed past just cosmetic issues but they throw that out the window later because they realized the show was going to last\n Comment: And the person I am talking about is also an actor\n Comment: Generally speaking, designers are local 600, directors are DGA, producers are PGA/non-union/non-affiliate.\n Comment: Nah you right man, people should go hungry. Sorry to have misunderstood\n Comment: As a journalist you sure are using a *lot* of non-objective words like hunch, feel like, likely, etc etc.\n Comment: Yes, this EXACTLY. Sucks you're being downvoted.\n\nFor example, when I was 20 and worked at an outsourced call center for Verizon during the CWA strike, I was a scab. Did I know I was a scab? No. Did I really understand the full context of the strike, or what the unions were trying to achieve? No. I just needed to pay my fucking rent, and didn't have a union. I was working as a scab before the strike, and continued to be one after the strike too.\n\nThankfully with a decade + of learning and growing I've done, I realized that it doesn't MATTER if you know it or not. A scab is a scab. They aren't necessarily bad people (although some are), but ultimately they are hurting workers' collective ability to demand better wages and working conditions, and rather than helping to break strikes they should join the union and demand better from their employers.\n Comment: Fuck them saggy buttholes\n Comment: Seeing as how SAG started striking just a couple weeks ago, it's most likely that they shot this ahead of time, especially since the reporter seems to be an actress. Hard to believe that the studios didn't plan for the strike and just decided to shoot promo on the fly, particularly one as detailed as this.\n Comment: From what other people are saying it’s just that it was filmed before the strike, which makes sense, marketing usually create their commercials well in advice for approval.\n Comment: No he's a fully grown man.\n Comment: The original newsclip is sixteen years old. He's in his mid-twenties, and hasn't had any acting roles from what I can gather. His public presence is pretty much just about the meme.\n Comment: Only the Union deal in absolutes.\n Comment: people see a few millionaires and assume acting is a highly paid profession. sag has 100,000 members...ask someone to name even 200 actors and theyd struggle\n Comment: No. So if someone is calling someone a scab, they're not doing so because they're on one side of the picket line or the other.\n Comment: They don't even need to be paid, not that I don't see anyone volunteering to do construction work.\n Comment: Huh. That's gotta be an American exclusive quirk of the language IMO. Singular \"they\" is a totally normal thing in British English, heck it might be the formally correct thing in some circumstances.\n Comment: They as a singular has existed longer than \"you\" has existed.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: The \"he\" in the third sentence is the \"I like turtles\" kid.\n Comment: The second part of my comment was referring to the guy in OP’s video.\n Comment: As someone who has worked on commercials as talent and knows what payscale is $1000 for a day is easily the rate here. I made $700 for a half day with 3 lines two weeks ago. And that was a non union small budget set\n Comment: Y'know, my reading comprehension skills suck today. I thought you said he should have gotten more than $1k. Color me stupid today.\n Comment: But then that implies you wouldn't be blown away by anything between $0-999\n Comment: Yes, maybe more\n Comment: It has to be the same guy or it doesn't really make any sense - the first thing people are going to assume and/or ask is 'is that the same kid all grown up?'. \n\nThe idea is that he just really loves turtles, even 16 years later. Regardless, I would expect the guy to get far more than $1000 from Paramount. I mean, he has the bargaining power in the situation. He's the star of the ad.\n Comment: His death was equally stupid and he found out right after he bought a house. Showrunner is keeps killing stuff. Still don’t know how he has a job.\n Comment: once the prison saga was over and i realized how much of the show was just characters shooting at each other behind cover and accidentally getting bit by avoidable zombies i lost all interest. \n\ni even liked the comics too lol\n Comment: Then the zombies run past humans and start tearing into some grains ruthlessly\n Comment: >In The Walking Dead corpses don't come back to life if they weren't infected before they died.\n\nWhat made you jump to this conclusion w/o watching the show and knowing it isn't true? Every living human is infected. You die, you become a walker. Everyone. All of them. Every human. This was revealed at the end of Season 1.\n Comment: Well you edited your comment. Originally it just said they’re a producer…\n\nLove getting downvotes by people that have no clue what is right and wrong\n Comment: lol I'm a published non-fiction author and I write like an idiot on reddit\n Comment: Well yeah I'm not reporting anything haha -- this isn't a story I've looked into\n Comment: Usually I can tell what angle my downvotes are coming from, but I'm a little baffled at this one. I didn't think I said anything false or controversial. So it goes!\n Comment: Unions are the reason people in the USA aren't working 16 hour days, 7 days a week\n\nIf you don't support collective action like this, you care more about how big a yacht a billionaire can afford than you do about the welfare of the people who are just trying to make ends meet doing a job they're good at. Most actors are not wealthy.\n Comment: The post I replied to was just so completely stupid that I had to say something. The complete cluelessness to \"average\" salaries, the tangent about how sag isn't a real union and doesn't strike with other workers. I am shocked that they wrote so much despite being so wrong.\n\n\"A live alterting amount\" was rich too.\n Comment: What’s ‘funny’ is to keep the business operating scabs are often paid more then the union workers, which shows the companies could have probably met union demands but refused to.\n Comment: The global economy would certainly give a shit. And once the ripple effects of a multi-billion dollar industry collapsing start affecting you, I bet you would give a shit.\n Comment: That begs the question, \"What color is a stupid color and why is it chartreuse?\"\n Comment: Oh the actor bought a house. I thought you meant the character bought a house. Zombie apocalypse, and still got a mortgage\n Comment: fuck scott gimple. told chandler riggs he wasnt going to kill off carl anytime soon and that he was a part of the future of the show. so he bought a house close to the set and postponed college to then just be killed off anyways...\n Comment: What part of the original comment didn't have SAG in it? My original comment says they're a member of SAG, to which the reply stated no, because they're production. I said they're in SAG, what does that immediately imply?\n Comment: Listen you can talk like a dummy about whatever you want but people should use a bit more tact when throwing accusations around of scabbing toward a large group of individuals\n Comment: Yeah I get it, you're just walking around saying groups of people are probably scabs with no proof\n Comment: A lot of people on this site like to suck corporate boot\n Comment: >Unions are the reason people in the USA aren’t working 16 hour days, 7 days a week\n\nWhat about everyone that’s a non-union worker non working like that.  I’m pro union but I also don’t care.  Biased I guess as I’m a non-union worker\n Comment: That is almost certainly always the case (business owners exploit the labor of their employees and usually keep a fair chunk of profit, and if not then reinvesting that value back into the business in the hopes of keepijng an even larger chunk in the future), although from their perspective, they view it as a justified expense to keep the business afloat before the strikers get desperate enough to come back to job, at a lower pay than the scabs, ultimately resulting in paying less in wages overall, over time.  (One also imagines they they're probably hiring skeleton crews of scabs anyway)\n Comment: he was an incredibly terrible actor though. like, it felt painful to watch any scene with him\n Comment: I think I’m replying in the wrong thread idk mobile is weird. I thought someone said a production designer is part of the SAG union. Not a specific person who is a production designer who is also in SAG.\n\nMy b, I’ll bring the down votes on\n Comment: It's interesting to wonder whether this was the strategy due to the strike, I don't really care about the specific turtle guy and his personal thoughts on the strike. Doesn't seem like he's in the industry, this whole name calling of \"scab\" likely means nothing to him. Just a guy gettin to do something fun for a gig.\n\nThe real question is - will we see more of this kind of marketing?\n Comment: You're exhausting to talk to -- god forbid people talk about what they think on the internet.\n Comment: There are labor laws in place as well as standard labor practices that make it so you can't work somebody 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can thank unions and labor activists for creating that reality, even if you don't currently work a union job.\n Comment: Unions are the ones that made that happen for everyone, even if you're not in a union",

Along many railroads, is a sanctuary for animals without humans, trees and open water draining canals makes it perfect for a diverse nature to thrive, it's crazy how many animals and rare plants live there.\n Comment: Imagine being the turtles when a huge locomotive passes over you.\n Comment: Derailing a train????\n Comment: Derailing a train wdf, was that a ninja turtle\n Comment: They derail trains\nWhat\n Comment: Derailing trains....?\nColour me intrigued\n Comment: Who taught them how to use the tunnels?\n Comment: Wow, i didnt realize that was even a problem. I guess i just never thought of it!\n Comment: A simple solution. Now if we could have deer pedestrian overpasses….\n Comment: Imagine being the turtle that dismantles a train, literally trains 500 years and now there is nothing left to do as an immortal demigod\n Comment: Rich people shit fr\n Comment: We have 'frog tunnels' under a busy road that has forrest on one side and marsh on the other.\nIt's a migratory route for breeding for them and you don't see any dead frogs on the road thanks to it.\n Comment: I love this. This beautiful turtles can live Yesssss.\n Comment: It's ooze time\n Comment: His homie is coming to help him. I'm seen turtles actually so that before, plus he's in the way he could just get pushed anyway\n Comment: Came here to ask about this. How did that one happen???\n Comment: Too blurry to tell imo, could just be a colorful shell\n Comment: once we figure out how to respect our turtle overlords\n Comment: I apologize about the straw thing. That was my cousin, Reggie. He’s got a bit of a coke problem.\n Comment: Turtles all the way down.\n Comment: Don’t forget about the plastic rings from our drinks!\n Comment: They were derailing trains, those cunin turtles.\n Comment: Since never. For the train it would be no different than running over a marshmallow.\n Comment: So I looked it up!\n\n“Despite being small and adorable, the little turtles sometimes get caught in the switch rail mechanism—which switches the direction of the tracks—and they get crushed. When that happens, not only are the turtles killed but the rails don't fully switch and have to be serviced before trains can safely pass. According to The Japan Times, this has happened *13 times* between 2002 and 2014. “\n\nSo their corpses mess with the switch rail mechanism and cause absolute chaos. \n\nAbsolute mad lads, literally kamikaze-ing the Japanese rail system to demand roads for safe turtle travel.\n\nSort of badass.\n\nETA: [apparently they don’t derail trains!](https://reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/s/6ZQPdvNqGz) because there are people doing their jobs!\n Comment: Trains can crush huge rocks and not even budge from the rails, this is bullshit\n Comment: The damn koopas strike again\n Comment: In Denmark it relatively normal for the trains to be delayed due the leaves or snow on the track. So I would surprise me to hear that.\n Comment: Turtle shells are strong enough to derail a train\n Comment: But is a turtle smart enough to look for the tunnel?\n Comment: Where you think they got the inspiration for the Blue Shell in Mario Kart? It's because of all those trains who never made it to the station.\n Comment: It's a cable shaft. Look on the right it just ends. The turtles fell in and can't get out. But they just slap a different title on it and \"Japan\" and boom its wholesome\n Comment: Japerth\n Comment: It's a cable shaft. Look on the right it just ends. The turtles fell in and can't get out. But they just slap a different title on it and \"Japan\" and boom its wholesome\n Comment: When they get really, really mad… don’t upset the turtles!!!\n Comment: Not for the people on the train.\n Comment: Plopped off the side maybe.  Fighting the Foot is my second guess.\n Comment: Awesomely radical dude!\n Comment: SHAT ON A TURTLE!\n Comment: The Stay Puft Man is a marshmallow, and he could derail a train.\n\nSo the math checks out.\n Comment: Apparently their corpses get stuck in the switch rail mechanism, which causes the rail to be unable to fully engage and that derails the train!\n Comment: You definitely never heard of a super turtle\n Comment: This guy did the research and proved the reddit smartasses wrong lmaoi\n Comment:  Learning something new everyday\n Comment: So turtles are just going to *know* to use the underground?\n Comment: Apparently their corpses get stuck in the switch rail mechanism, causing the mechanism to not fully engage and they can delay trains that way!\n Comment: All according to Bowser's plan\n Comment: they look for the path of least resistance so they will go along the rail for quite a way before they attempt to climb it so if you space them often enough they will quite literally just fall into it.\n Comment: Too much pizza.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: It has never happened. What did happen however was a turtle getting crushed by a rail switch which prompted railway workers to go investigate why the switch didn't engage properly and that caused a train to not be able to depart from the station in time.\n\nEdit: Not saying that it can't theoretically happen because there's always a chance of gross negligence and human error. But there are sensors that alert about these sort of things long before any train is in any real danger of derailing because of it.\n Comment: They have habits and most animals would rather do the easy thing lol\n Comment: Makes sense. Thanks.\n Comment: Oooooh, I assumed there was at least a minor derailment — but *of course* Japan has people to check that things are properly engaged and then also has people to actually go check on those things and probably someone to call all that in \n\nThey’re not *Ohio*.",

I'm not a sewer guy though so I may be wrong, but it's probably possible to find places where there's more of just rainwater, wastewater, with only an occasional dookie, versus full on brown stream. \n\nLike, say, downstream from some steel mill plant. I've read that those use a TON of water for their operations, and only some places force them to clean it and return it, I'm guessing in other places it's just slightly filtered and dumped.\n Comment: I think they live in the storm sewers.\n Comment: I remember the rise episode where they treated the sewers like a water park. The brown water really grosses me out.\n Comment: 2012 TMNT had them live in an abandoned train station from what I remember, so I doubt they were as effective\n Comment: Happy Cake Day\n Comment: This is pretty different from your usual style 😆\n Comment: This is golden material.

I remember when April had to move in with them and water got splashed on her and one of the turtles don't worry it's river water.\n Comment: Well, there is sewers for waste, and storm sewers.  I wouldn't exactly call the storm sewer water clean, though.\n Comment: Storm sewer and sanitary sewer are two entirely different pipe systems so yes, they would be in the storm sewer.\n Comment: There are 2 kinds of sewers.\n\nGrey water sewers: storm drains, process water, basically just dirty water being disposed of. Most grey water requires minimal processing and just flows to wgerever it can be dumped. Not that I'd want to go for a swim, but if i had to pick i'd happily jump in a grey water sewer over a...\n\nBrown water sewer: this is where the shit flows. This is what your house is connected to. This requires extensive wastewater processing to be safe to dump into a river because of the sheer amount of waste in the water.\n\nIn some places these systems are combined and those are the places where you get sewage flooding out over the steets when the storm drains get overloaded.\n Comment: Storm sewers (rainwater) and sanitary sewers (poop) are totally different things. Hopefully the turtles live in a storm sewer. Though sanitary sewers are still mostly \"water\", at least visually. \n\nOn a side note, like you said, some factories have private systems. The absolute worst smelling sewer I've worked with was a private system for a chicken processing plant. I don't know *exactly* what was in that water, but all the manholes were full of feathers and the smell was intense. One of the only times I almost puked.\n Comment: thats where they moved to in the second movie after the foot clan attacked their hideout in the sewers in the first movie. the 2012 series basically mixed the OG series the OG movies and the 2003 series together\n Comment: To go outside when it has to go obviously. Why is it so hard for my fish to just get out of their comfort zone and pee in the grass for once?\n Comment: Thats the [life in the sea](https://youtu.be/Ys9UT7X5iCY?si=S0Dh5JZz9mN68lzI)\n Comment: Poop over the edge.\n Comment: Work From Home?\n Comment: If you’re right then the entirety of my childhood was spent in ignorance of the elephant in the room. I just knew they were rad and was disappointed when my turtle did not, in fact, have the metabolism to process pizza. \n Comment: No I don’t think they got abandoned, there was some mutation thing and the newly bought turtles got dropped in the middle of the street iirc\n Comment: They are in new york right? Hudson river water aint so hot either. Wouldn't want to get splashed with that.\n Comment: River water? In New York?\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n Comment: True, true, but as far as cartoon logic goes I guess they live, like, upstream of most sewer stuff. If there's even such a thing.\n Comment: Yooo thanks that's really cool actually. We don't do the sewer system justice it deserves, honestly. Taking all the societies' bonuses for granted, while these are incredible, really. And often are feats of engineering, too!\n Comment: I knew what this was before I clicked it but I’m still delighted.\nI love that show.\n Comment: Yup. Stop going all the way into the bathroom and just hunch down right there at your desk. \n\nBonus points if you do it during a teams meeting and just maintain eye contact with everyone else on the call.\n Comment: Correct. Kid carrying turtles saved an old man from an accident. Turtles fell and got washed into the sewer. When the truck crashed it spilled mutigen as well, which is what caused them to change.\n\nI think in the cartoons that was changed slightly to the kid just dropping it, and the turtles finding their way to a broken canister. But the original was meant to be a homage/parody of Daredevil's origin.\n Comment: Runoff water too\n Comment: My first hamster had a burial at sea in the Hudson. RiP Zelda. 🙏\n Comment: \"Hudson River pollution. Thick, rich, and creamy.\"\n Comment: Yes the Hudson River is right by New York\n\nCertainly not pleasant though\n Comment: Yup. It's because they're sp well engineered most of us don't *have* to think about them very often.\n Comment: I know the Hudson is there. That was my point😅\n Comment: And thank GOD for that... I had to mind the load in our old cottage house as it had some really old wiring and we couldn't like use the water boiler and microwave at the same time and it was kinda exhausting to constantly mind the load balancing. My friend's got gas in a tank outside and he has to constantly check the valves and make sure it's running fine and check for leaks and that's also not cool. \n\nHaving to re-check everything, double-check for gas leaks all the time, make sure that you won't get electrocuted is so old school I don't like it one bit\n Comment: Ahhh your comment sounded more like one of doubt to me tbh\n\nMy bad lol\n Comment: No worries!",
