We're comming for you Barry B Benson!!\n Comment: Imagine living next to someone who is this dumb\n Comment: Bees? on MY property?! stealing pollen that is MY BIRTHRIGHT?!?!?!?!1?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnbeelievable.\n Comment: Counter Suit: The neighbor is creating an attractive nuisance leaving colorful flowers in plain view of bees, children and little old ladies. Neighbor refuses to pay for labor of pollination by bees of said flowers which leads to a net gain for said neighbor of vegetables and seeds.\n Comment: Problem always seems to be those local urban bees. Never those bees from the countryside. Crime is crime don’t bee discriminatory.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: \"Bees keep my world alive, and my neighbor and their bees do all the work! How can I sue them?\" Asshole needs the Wicker Man treatment.\n Comment: Bee prepared for a battle, would be my best advice. Legal fees aren’t cheap, and they might sting a little. But stick to you guns. Try to stir up a little buzz in the press. If it does go to court don’t stumble and bumble over your words. Be polite of course, you catch more flies with honey, but let them know you mean beesiness.\n Comment: Irish lawyer here - in ancient Ireland (under a system called the Brehon law) there was actually a system for exactly this situation!\n\n- a neighbour with a nice garden would get a a portion of the honey made by his neighbour's bees.\n\nThe OP is just living a few hundred years too late...\n Comment: I mean yea you can sue anyone, doesn’t mean it’ll end good for you\n Comment: I don’t see what all the buzz is about\n Comment: It’s funny cuz in my town they passed a ruling banning “agricultural activity in residential areas” specifically because my dad (who’s a beekeeper) had a beehive by the side of the garage and the neighbors behind us complained always getting attacked and stung\n\nIt’s even funnier when my dad studied his beehive’s behavior for a couple of days to find out all the bees were flying towards a completely other direction, and that the bees the neighbors complained about were in fact wasps because apparently a lot of people can’t tell the difference\n Comment: Legally speaking I think the main obstacle would be proving these are neighbors bees and not wild bees...\n Comment: One of my favorite lawyer YouTube pages, Legal Eagle, did a video on this!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3kfGIz3u0RA\n\nAnswer: lol nah, but interesting legal question\n Comment: We had 3 hives. Someone put some sort of poison either in some water or near our yard. All 3 hives died. Maybe this person is our neighbor.\n Comment: Besides this insane persons reasons, if I had a beekeeper neighbour and an unnatural amount of times I had bees flying in my house and shit I'd also have an issue with that, that said I'm confident we could talk it out and fix it like normal people\n Comment: I think those bees should be cited for criminal trespassing and burglary. Let them tell their sob story to the bee judge. Don't go easy on them. Sentence them to bee prison.\n Comment: Yes! You can absolutely sue. It's the best thing about the United States of America. You must first identify and document each culprit (bee). This information must include the following: A) distinguishing markings on each culprit for proper identification. B) the amount of pollen stolen. C) the duration of time to commit said theft. More than likely RICO will be enacted. Good luck jerkface!\n Comment: I feel like everyone is missing the point. These bees are molesting these flowers. Groping and climbing all over the flowers then moving onto the next partner like that flower meant nothing. Disgusting\n Comment: *Plucks bee in the abdomen* WHERE DID YOU PUT THE REST OF YOUR POLLEN\n\nHoney Bee: *cough cough* Get Fucked\n Comment: Sue the queen. She’s the bitch allowing them to go wherever they want stealing pollen all over the place.\n Comment: Bees?\n Comment: This is parody, right?\n Comment: O laughed 😅 I've sadly met ppl like that.  Wtf 🤣\n Comment: Just bee carfeul on how you approach this\n Comment: Just put up a fence to keep them out.    Simple as that.  Ha ha\n Comment: BEES?\n Comment: How old were you when you suffered your head injury?\n Comment: … actual question, can a person sue if bees attack that person? That seems more plausible\n Comment: This person doesnt know how to neighbor. They will never get honey from them, or atleast I hope they never get any\n Comment: Who died and made her queen bee?\n Comment: i’m sure she was gonna use that pollen\n Comment: There is a lawyer who would take this case. That lawyer needs to be disbarred.\n Comment: The Karen behavior on Nextdoor is just amazing.\n Comment: I know Quora bait when I see it…\n Comment: Maybe the neighbor should charge them for polinating the plants\n Comment: Karen sued for not paying beekeeper for pollination services\n Comment: You can pay them for their bees making your garden amazing!\n Comment: Karen bee-ing wild.\n Comment: Fight the power!!! It’s just Big Honey trying to perpetuate SOCIALISM!!!!!!\n Comment: Seems like a really waspy area\n Comment: This isn’t a felhoney\n Comment: These people walk among us...... let that sink in\n Comment: Just put down an anti air installation and shoot down everything that enters your airspace\n Comment: So basically they don’t want their plants having sex.\n Comment: The mf acts like he had a plan to use the pollen for something. What? You gonna make honey like the bees?\n Comment: Yes, sue him. Lose all your money on your lawyer, lose the case. Pay for the neigbours lawyer and learn from it.\n Comment: I think this person is missing the bigger issue here, which is that the bees are ASSAULTING his flowers! A criminal complaint must be filed!\n Comment: Bee's \"stealing\" pollen or nectar has got to be the most entitled American thing I've seen in the last 20 seconds.\n Comment: Holy fuck this is dumb.\n Comment: This is the type of person that winds up burning their neighbors hives, further endangering an already endangered species that is key to our continued survival.\n Comment: I think we have crossed over into Karen type territory here...\nI wonder how much time is being spent standing at the window watching the bees and getting angrier and angrier...\nWow.\nJust approach the neighbor and say jokingly that the bees spend a lot of time in your yard and see how they respond...\nA lawsuit over this??? Wow!\n Comment: Reminds me of a neighbor moaning there too many birds in her garden...\n\nBecause people were leaving nuts out for them \n\nThe audacity of them lol\n Comment: My family suffers with money and we had an opportunity to house a bee farm and our neighbor complained and said he’s sue if we did. Some neighbors on the opposite side of us now have a bee farm.\n Comment: What size are these bees to be able to steal a flower? Do they carry knives with them to cut the stems?\n Comment: When I did real estate photography I had a shoot at a house with a bee farm in the backyard — while it seemed like a nice thing to have, most of the neighbors were a little annoyed apparently because of the requirements needed to maintain the bee farm.\n\nFrom what I recall, none of the neighboring houses within a 50 yard radius could use pesticides/lawn treatment on *their* yards due to it being a potential hazard to the bee’s wellbeing — which, while not using pesticides isn’t technically a bad thing, it was an environment that gets VERY buggy in the summer.\n Comment: This is a problem in America we don’t punish people for taking happiness away from their neighbors by taking advantage of a social understanding.\n Comment: Are we talking like a few hundred bees or hundreds of thousands?\n Comment: If this person succeeds , then I hope this person gets sued by Monsanto for making money off of seeds that they own the patent for.\n Comment: They sound like a real wheeze at parties\n Comment: Somebody failed science class....\n Comment: >I was stung once when I was a child\n\nmeanwhile my dad: catches poor bees and makes them sting his back because it helps with the back pain\n Comment: Her neighbor makes honey but she makes jealy! 😜\n Comment: Joja employee\n Comment: Un-Bee-Lee-able\n Comment: You don’t own the air space over your property. \nBees 1 - Karen 0\n Comment: The stupid is strong on this one LOL.\n Comment: Can you imagine being bothered by something like this\n Comment: You can't sue the beekeeper but you can in fact sue the individual bees who are trespassing. The first thing you need to do is look for identifying marks on the offending bees so when they appear in court you can point them out to the judge.\n Comment: Yeah so this is a sample \"case\" used for legal studies when studying tort law.\n\nfunny.. but made up\n Comment: \"I was stung once as a child, i know how dangerous they can be. \"\n\nWhat a badass.\n Comment: The epitome of stupid fucking humans thinking we own the planet.\n Comment: Bees gunna buzz bitches.\n Comment: People’s pettiness is amazing!\n Comment: I would love to see a line of bees flying one large flower each, single file, out of this person's yard.\n Comment: Sounds like a lovely neighbor to have.\n Comment: Sounds like a bee-otch\n Comment: JFC… go to school or something… get a life and help the bees at the same time. Go buy a jar of honey to help your neighbor continue to keep bees and pollinate.\n Comment: You all laugh, but people in Texas get upset about the pecans. I get when they come on the lawn.  But sometimes they shout at people picking them up from the sidewalk.   It is a whole thing on the subs, facebook, next door etc.\n Comment: Ohhh beehiaveeee!\n Comment: You have to wonder how exactly the person who wrote this planned on using the flower nectar these bees were allegedly stealing...\n Comment: To bee or not to bee.🤷🏽‍♂️\n Comment: Maybe it wasnt meant to Bee.\n Comment: I can see why your neighbor has never shared honey with you. We always share with our neighbors because they aren’t entitled nightmares.\n Comment: I'm so confused by the dog analogy.  It would maybe be like if the dog stole the neighbors tool and the dog owner used it to make honey?\n Comment: 100% deranged, 100% American\n Comment: Bee Lawyer here AMA. \n\nThis is a common question. What most folks don’t understand is you have to follow up by pursuing litigation with every individual bee for a fraction of the damages. It is a lot of paperwork.\n Comment: They should sue the sun for stealing sunlight from the plants\n Comment: They should thank their neighbor…without bees, we all die.\n Comment: Stealing pollen from my flowers….I just…\n Comment: People like this make my head hurt.\n Comment: If they had a clue, they would know that bees POLLINATE the flowers, that in turn, produces MORE flowers. They should be grateful, not vindictive.\n Comment: I just want the entire court case televised.\n Comment: Well this thread has been a real buzz for the punsters…however, some are just droning on thinking they’re the bees-knees as they wax lyrical. And all beecause the neighbour is behaving appolenly!\n Comment: You should beeeee careful …..\n Comment: “They flying in your meadows\nsnatchin’ yo pollen up…”\n Comment: He has a bee hive and is a beekeeper. They work hard to get the honey. You didn’t do anything but move next door. Now he can charge you for pollenating your flowers probably and the judge will probably go with this as a counter suit against another fucking self entitled Karen who wants to complain\n Comment: You can sue for the theft of pollen after you settle with me your content stealing of my trees air.\n Comment: Bruh he never got a jar of honey from his beekeeper neighbour… That is pretty sad. I wonder why?\n Comment: The neighbor needs to head them off at the pass and present them with a bill for pollination services. Their bees have been doing the work of ensuring their flowers continue to propagate without issue (saving them from pesky trips to the garden center for new perennials) for free in exchange for nectar, but their work is far more valuable so if they want to engage in frivolous lawsuits without understanding how they’re already benefiting two can play that game…. Now how to calculate the unpaid wages for 100+ workers…. 🤔\n Comment: Don’t people pay beekeepers to have their bees pollinate their crops? I think you might get a bill instead of bills\n Comment: Pollen stealing whores\n Comment: He should sue you for pollinating your garden lol\n Comment: I would pay to see that trial televised.  I would gladly accept jury duty for this. I want to tell my children one day\n Comment: Going to have to document everything that was stolen\n Comment: Some people are un bee lievable. 🐝\n Comment: The plants will be sending you an invoice for all that oxygen you have been breathing\n Comment: When the flowers are pollinated by bees and make new flowers, the flowers become MINE. \n\nSame logic.\n Comment: This guy needs to beehave.\n Comment: Ahh capitalism.\n Comment: She should be thanking the beekeeper bc those bees are taking care of the flowers\n Comment: I'm 100% sure they are Americans\n Comment: I bet whoever wrote this nonsense is Karen. No more no less\n Comment: You can’t 🐝 serious….\n Comment: Bees only want one thing, and it's disgusting.\n Comment: Sir please identify which bees you recognize from your neighbor’s yard that stole your flower powder?\n Comment: Now we know why he does not get any honey lol\n Comment: Pretty sure Monsanto did something similar. Modified their crop, where it spread, via the wind, to a neighbouring farm. The neighbouring farmer ended up getting in shit because they were in possession of Monsanto's product.\n Comment: Imagine this clown as head of the HOA…\n Comment: ![gif](giphy|p3p8bpBtFVNhS|downsized)\n Comment: You should sue yourself\n Comment: They are fucking pollinating they can’t be told not too\n Comment: The school system is a clear failure in this instance. Maybe sue the school board instead.\n Comment: I can excuse ignorance, but I can't excuse an ignorant asshole.\n Comment: This is hilarious\n Comment: I’m with you on this one. We had termites wreck our front porch, and I followed several of them to my neighbor’s wood shop.  Well, those SOB termites were so filled with wood shavings that they could barely walk!  Which means they were ruining my porch just to piss me off. So I dragged their asses into court and the judge ruled in my favor because the defendants were dining on his gavel.\n Comment: I’m not sure this person understands how garden’s work…\n Comment: \ndo yourself a favor - please reach out to a good therapist. Serious\n Comment: Meanwhile the flower: can I sue my landlord for cockblocking and being a complete idiot.\n Comment: This sub is comedy gold\n Comment: his bees are keeping your flowers alive idiot\n Comment: I really wish this person would take this to court and all major News networks cover it\n Comment: This is some logic you can only get after mainlining a near lethal dose of American capitalistic entitlement your whole life shoot shit\n Comment: This person makes me glad I'm not on Next Door.\n Comment: I don't think that people can get any more petty than this lol\n Comment: R/fuckyoukaren\n Comment: Here’s the short answer no and here’s the short reason, bees are gonna do what they do naturally you cannot claim ownership of your flowers from nature you absolute buffoon. Your neighbor doesn’t owe you a thing. For what? The way I see it she’s keeping up the bees she’s got the equipment for beekeeping and the bees are just being bees. She herself is not trespassing on your property so what are the cops going to do write a citation to the bees.\n\nAlso if the bees didn’t pollinate your flowers you wouldn’t have flowers you absolute dip shit.\n Comment: OMG.  The poster of this is such a jerk.  What a horrible person.\n Comment: I am a bee lawyer.  She has a case.\n\nAnd you may ask “how do you know it’s a woman?”\n\nI know\n Comment: [Trespassing bees?](https://gfycat.com/jealousfixedasianwaterbuffalo)\n Comment: People are dumb. Can we please restart the drinking bleach trend?\n Comment: This is what ChatGPT has to say:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's unlikely that you would have a valid legal claim against a beekeeper whose bees collect pollen from your plants. In fact, bees are an essential part of the pollination process and are necessary for many plants to reproduce. Therefore, it's generally not considered a harmful act for bees to collect pollen from your plants.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, if the beekeeper's bees are causing damage to your property, such as by destroying your crops or causing harm to your person or animals, you may have a legal claim. You should consult with a local attorney who can advise you on the specific laws in your area and help you determine if you have a viable case.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also worth noting that many jurisdictions have laws and regulations in place to protect bees and beekeeping. As such, it's important to understand the local laws and regulations before taking any legal action against a beekeeper.\n Comment: I'm gonna go with NTA in this. The least the neighbors could do was give them some honey every once in a while.\n Comment: To be fair, a free jar of honey would have been a nice gesture\n Comment: Unpopular opinion perhaps,but unless this poster is a complete jerk (which may be the case)a jar of honey from the bee keeper would be a great gift to their neighbors.That’s what my brother’s bee keeping neighbor did.\n Comment: Lawyer up\n Comment: Get the Monsanto lawyers on the case and you’ll own his house and bee operation before you know it\n Comment: Note: i am not a lawyer so take everything i said with a grain of salt \n\nSome legal grounds that he might be able to stand on, if he were to sue his neighbor consist of mybe these three?\n\n\"The bees pose a danger to the garden\"\nIf you managed to ague that bees are pets(tough luck my guy). You can file a civil lawsuits stating that the bees are destroying his gardens? This is highly unlikely to ever go through since one google search shows flowers need bees to survive. Im just putting this here incase the owner might have done something to bees that makes them destructive.\n\n\"The bees pose a danger to me/whoever tf lives with you\"\nAn average adult can withstand 1000 bees sting!! and a child can withstand 500 bees sting!!! Before it becomes fatal (Jeez yea that alot lol). You probably gonna need to provides videos evidence to show that it infact possible to be stung 1000 at once by a bunch bees and the video evidence most likely need to be like 5 hours long atleast. In an average bee hive there on average 60k-80k bees quite alot i would say but not all if them leaves the bee hive. Since i couldnt find the exact number of work bees( the one who usually leave the hive) let go with 30 percent. Let go with the high note and says there 80k in his neighbor bee hive, there would be 24k work bees!. Wait theres another catch! Not all work bees start leaving as soon as there born! But im to lazy to do the math so were gonna say 50% and call it a day(fuck you if you dont like that). Workers bees can travel as far as 12 kilo (8 miles) from the hives but they usually only travel 3 kilo within the hives and average American gardens is 96 square feet. Let do some bullshit math realy quick! So there usually 2 bees in a feet lol!! Yea that aint much. Since we know that an average American gardens is 96 square feet let do some more math!! Done the math so there be around 384 bees in his gardens might be annoying but not fatals. \n\nThis still might work is you gir deadly bees allergies \n\nAnd no if you tried to sue for money because the bees stole the pollens that not gonna work. Since bees are wild animals and the beekeeper cant control to the point of dont go there or there.\n Comment: Very made up, but touching on how dumb some are.\n Comment: That’s why I keep a pistil for home defense.\n Comment: Jesus, the human race is just fucking terrible.\n Comment: Is this person for real? Bitch probably wouldn't have her precious flowers every year without those bees. What a fricken moron.\n Comment: ![img](emote|t5_2r5rp|8484)\n Comment: Just ask for a jar of honey you Scroogefuck.\n Comment: Maybe she’s allergic and they’re giving her hives?\n Comment: Their beekeeping neighbour should sue them for the value of the pollination services. And for being a fucking dick.\n Comment: Is no one going to mention the money this person owes the beekeeper for pollination services?  Tremendous exposure here for a countersuit.\n Comment: Tell me you’re from the USA without telling me you’re from the USA.\n Comment: The stupid is deep and wide in this one.  Once again, the great American educational system at work.\n Comment: What a wack job.\n Comment: I was hoping this guy was joking but I think he's serious.\n Comment: Last stage capitalism.\n Comment: This is the Most American thing ive read today\n Comment: Must be an American\n Comment: Not that I have any issue with bees, but for arguments sake..\n\nLet's say a person enjoys the presence of flies and maggots in his yard and leaves out rotting garbage purposely to attract them causing them to fly all around his surrounding neighbors property too.\n\nShould he be treated any differently?  \n\nSurely flies are important to the fabric of our ecosystem.\n Comment: If you get stung by one of those bees you can sue.\n Comment: He should share one jar though for using her flowers and for hazard of living next to bees\n Comment: Libertarians in a nutshell\n Comment: You can kill the bees until your neighbor complains.  Then negotiate.\n Comment: Kill your self now\n Comment: Well I can see where they are upset about this. The neighbors bees are getting nectar and pollen from the flowers that they don't own and then they are selling the honey for profit and then the person who made the post gets nothing out of it. \nBut then again...\n*they're bees*\n\nEdit:spelling\n Comment: This is old, and just as dumb now as when I first heard/read it.\n Comment: I would love to see how the Republican’s on the Supreme Court would handle this case.\n Comment: I mean, logically there is a tiny bit of a point. \n\nBut also, stop being so American. Geezus\n Comment: If they had their own bees then yeah they could probably sue successfully. If not then no.\n\nOr if they're allergic to bees and lived there prior to the neighbor starting bee keeping, then being told about the situation and didn't do anything about it. The it could maybe kinda be some for of assault or negligence.\n\nOther than that I don't see anything they can do legally.\n\nPS. bees are actually harmful to the ecosystem. They kill other pollinators that are more efficient and don't take all the nectar of a flower. At least 2 species of pollinators have been eradicated in some areas of the US due to the careless introduction of bees to the area. So bees dying off is ironically a good thing for the environment. It's just bad for the honey industries.\n Comment: Have to tried killing the bees? Perhaps using a flame thrower?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: We have come for your nectar.\n Comment: Wow, they are losing millions of dollars. Someone stop those bees!\n Comment: No\n Comment: The bee movie 2: electric boogaloo\n Comment: Maybe Charlie is an expert in bee law as well as bird law?\n Comment: Didnt know Satan was interested in sueing us mortals\n Comment: Conversely I’m going to sue you for stealing my air to inflate that worthless melon on top of your head\n Comment: Bee movie 2\n Comment: Got love Merica!\n Comment: How can they distinguish between freelance freeloader bees and neighbor “owned” bees?\n Comment: I mean when I have 100 bees on my chicken feed I consider asking my beekeeper neighbor to put out his own… my chickens need that dang it.\n Comment: Next door is just as bad a Facebook but in a more condensed and local way.\n Comment: He better not 😡\n Comment: Well Karen, May I call you Karen…\n Comment: Without those bees, you'd fall to your knees. Leave them bee. They are a vital part of our survival.\n Comment: In CA, yes you can take that capitalist to court!\n Comment: The great pollen caper of '21. Never forget.\n Comment: What’re they going to do when the neighbor invoices them for pollination service in their garden lmao wtf is wrong with people 🤯🤯🤯\n Comment: Now if they had mentioned guns/school shootings in there,it could of been the most American thing on the internet today.\n Comment: They about to sue the bees for trespassing?\n Comment: How would you put a monetary value on pollen?\n Comment: \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us 'cause we're the little guys. And what I'm hoping is that after this is all over, you'll see how by taking our honey, you're not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are.\"\n Comment: \"stealing the pollen or nectar from my flowers\" that's..... that's the point\n Comment: This is the kind of person I would hate even before I spoke to them.\n Comment: Burn the flower bed, lay concrete in it's place, problem solved. /s\n\nPoor bees just doing their thing 🐝\n Comment: What a tired azz repost 🙄\n Comment: given that there is a WORLD shortage of bees... and you are creating drama but wanting to sue... seems like something an American would due... altho a nice gesture would be to receive a jar of honey as a major contributor for the bees .\n\nBut what if this bee keeper was a a block away or half a k/m away... would you think everyone with in flying distance of these bees be entitled as well?\n Comment: I would put a hornets nest up by my flowers 😈\n Comment: That's a classic case of GTP or Grand Theft Pollen.\n Comment: Whatta beetch.\n Comment: You say the bees are stealing pollen from flowers you planted after someone \"stole\" them from the earth and now the bees are getting compensation\n Comment: American (USA) jurisprudence has long established that the beekeeper is not held liable for the actions of the bees.\n Comment: My dad, who lives in a rural part of Spokane,  has a neighbor who raises bees and once the neighbor came to visit and my Dad mentioned that his bees loved his new water feature. He showed him the dozens of bees hanging out drinking from his pond. The neighbor immediately said, \"oh this fantastic, thank you. I owe you some honey.\" He left and came back with a big jar of honey and another with some honeycomb in it. The neighbor told him to let him know when he's out and he'll refill it. This was years ago  My Dad jokes that the amount of free honey he's gotten from his neighbor has probably saved him more money than the water feature cost.\n Comment: Man - these responses are gonna sting.\n Comment: The worst part is with the right Karen ass Judge, they could win the case too.\n Comment: Homey bees rarely sting , relax\n Comment: The hardest part would be proving ownership of the bees.\n Comment: Then one night, all the bees swarm around the whiner and begin carrying the whiner to a dock where the beekeeper and the queen bee on the keepers shoulder is waiting and aid the bees in strapping weights and rope on the whiner before pushing whiner in the water...\n Comment: Sounds like they need a wall!\n Comment: Your an idiot\n Comment: #suethebees\n Comment: A fair settlement is the fact that you and everyone else on earth get to LIVE!\n Comment: Compare this to Monsanto’s takeover of family owned farms…\n Comment: She should just get up earlier each morning than the bees do, and gather all the pollen herself. That’d sure show ‘em.\n Comment: I hope someone suggests a screen patio over their entire backyard, I think they might just do it.\n Comment: This can’t bee real\n Comment: Those Bees be trespassin.\n Comment: 😆 The only problem here is the way you see it. Go ahead and take him to court. Just watch out when I bring in that 3rd-grade teacher to explain to you again how the pollination process works.\n Comment: Bees?!\n\nBeads.\n\nBEADS?!\n Comment: That has to be a 47y/o caucasian North American woman\n Comment: How about you give them some of your harvest as they lilely improved your yeild.\n Comment: 😂 The bees are stealing the pollen\n Comment: New idea for dog training...\n Comment: It's a wasp in disguise\n Comment: Best be careful with this because the beekeeping neighborhood might start charging this person for the pollinating effort his bees are doing…I mean, it’s free labor.\n Comment: I would personally sue, or attempt to sue because those bees would make me fear for my life. But I have an issue and I aim to avoid them at all costs... before that I would heavily invest in raid and kill any that come close to me. Neighbor complains I tell Jim keep the hive contained I'm allergic. I have a phobia not allergy, but I may as well.\n Comment: I mean, it must suck to have a ton of bees in your backyard to the point you don't want to go out there, but everything else? Nah, shut up\n Comment: The bees are trespassing…?!?! 🤣🤣🤣 I can’t breathe!!!\n Comment: The real solution is to start raising WASPS. Yeah you'll get stung regularly, and yeah you won't be able to go out and enjoy your flowers ever, but they'll kill off the bees and then your neighborhood won't get to enjoy their yard or flowers or honey or profit anymore\n Comment: Next door is a cesspool no matter the location 🤦‍♂️\n Comment: You could sue, but a judge with a sense of humor might order that you accept payment in honey. While you are at it, you might be able to answer a question that has troubled me for years. Do bee farts really smell like honey, or is that just an old wives tale? Asking for a friend\n Comment: \"I was stung once as a child so I know how dangerous bees are\" yeah and I was stung more than twelve times before I was even ten years old and even I know that this is ridiculous.  Also lmao the dog analogy is absolute garbage, if those bees were stealing from anyone it would be the flowers, like no you didn't make that pollen, the flowers did and they like the bees.\n Comment: Stop the world, I want to get off!\n Comment: What a fucknut.\n Comment: Your Honor, his bees are clearly infringing on my property in exhibits A-F! He has no right to MY pollen!\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Ok serious answer my city has a rule that if you want to do this, you must ask your neighbors if they are OK with it. I was not cuz My whole family was allergic . But if at least 80 percent were ok and signed, they could. They did now where they live the bee house was closer to my house than  there's  .when I went to the city mad as hell they told them to move it closer to there own home, they don't have bees anymore 🙂\n Comment: Oh man. Just when I think humans can’t get any dumber…….\n Comment: Is this real???  If so, worst neighbor (person) ever.\n Comment: Come on, this can’t be real\n Comment: Bee movie 2\n Comment: Bee Movie 2: How Flowers Work\n Comment: Legal Eagle covered this. The answer is probably not. I mean, you can sue, but the law is against you.\n Comment: This has got to be trolling.\n Comment: Sometimes people just need a firm punch in the face to get their brain working again, like a hard reset lol!\n Comment: Are you serious?\nThis has got to be the dumbest post on Redditt\n Comment: Reddit, where brain cells go to die.\n Comment: What has this world comb to?\n Comment: Go fall in a well..\n Comment: Release the bees! https://youtu.be/6jnecnhS-Z4\n Comment: I really wish people would leave the names and locations of these posts. I would live to look it up and see the comments.\n Comment: Absurd rant about the bee’s stealing her pollen.\n Comment: this can't be real or this guy takes the cake...or the mud pie.\n Comment: You could just mow down all your lovely  flowers and show the neighbors and the bees that they can’t take advantage of you!\n Comment: ![gif](giphy|R9yLfikwYAF32)\n Comment: At first i thought this was just a shitpost but now i know they really are just that stupid\n Comment: Wouldn't have happened if the flowers had guns.\n Comment: This answer cracked me up. Very well written!\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: “Enter your airspace” 😂🤣🐝\nThis is good!\n Comment: Actually, airspace falls under the jurisdiction of the FAA. So OP would need to file a complaint alleging unpermitted commercial activity in controlled airspace, as well as operating a self powered commercial aviation vehicle without proper collision avoidance transfers. The bees will definitely lose their pilot's license.\n\nSource: I too smoke rocks Joe Rogan\n Comment: Also we need proof that each bee is from this specific hive. What if there are other bees, or the occasional wasp? Can’t bee too careful in your evidence collection.\n Comment: One problem you may face is a countersue when the neighbor will attempt to say that their bees help your flowers.  Keep in mind these flowers are not giving verbal or written consent to have their pollen spread to who knows where.  Also make sure to tag the bees from other neighbors so you have more luck with a class action lawsuit against the neighborhood.\n Comment: Your honor the value of pollination should not be subtracted from the damages. Them \"pollinating\" the flowers is no difference than a burglar cleaning your dishes.\n Comment: Don't forget to chemically tag the polin and buy a jar of the neighbors honey (leave it sealed) so you can prove that it was your polin being used in the honey.\n Comment: Please share the video of you serving the queen.\n Comment: Or take the easy route, set up a sweet nectar feeder for \"birds,\" and then make sure to set it so only bees 🐝  can enter! You then set up a camera, do all the calculations, and nail those stealing bastards!!  \n  Just make sure you only record nectar taken by the bees with your neighbors name on them!!! (Beekeepers definitely mark all their bees as not to pick up strays or lose their amazing bee honey workers!)\n Comment: “Good luck, Honey…”\n Comment: My wife keeps bees. Thanks for that reply, she was dying laughing!\n Comment: I like you already!\n Comment: More to the point maybe he should take into consideration what his flowers want.  Or maybe his neighbor could charge him a maintenance and delivery fee for all the work his bees are doing for his flowers.\n Comment: It's like the guy watched Bee Movie and thought it was a documentary.\n Comment: He also can’t prove it’s the neighbors bee’s.  Bees forage approximately a 640 acre territory, so it may bee that his neighbors bees aren’t the bees foraging off his flowers.  Good luck with that one schmuck!  Long live the new keeper! 👏\n Comment: Bee movie 2: Gardener’s Revenge\n Comment: I feel like the \"bees make honey from pollen\" thing is the belief of close to half of the population.

How much would it cost the unpleasant neighbor to hire a human to manually pollinate all the veggies and fruits in the yard?\n Comment: This is the right answer\n Comment: I'm probably going to be downvoted.\n\nBut I got to say I actually get the OP in the screenshot. I don't think a lot of gardens are natural. They usually are maintained, and flowers are planted. So the so-called pollination does nothing here for the garden owner.\n\nOn the contrary, bees need flowers to produce honey.  There is a practice called migratory beekeeping that travels to get flowers in different periods of the year. \n\nIf the garden owner spends effort in maintaining a garden all year round, it's not exactly that unreasonable to ask for compensation. Petty? Maybe. But not exactly ridiculous.\n Comment: Bee Hives Matter!\n Comment: He would fail from the start for not being able to state a reason for the case.\n Comment: Oh oh no not the bees! Not the bees! Oh they’re in my eyes! My eyyyyes!!! Agghhhhhh!! Agggrgggrgggghhh!!!\n Comment: Thread’s over. All the puns have been used.\n Comment: Its ok his grandfather was from Ireland\n Comment: I was thinking something like this. It does seem like the beekeeper is benefiting directly from the efforts of the gardener. The gardener does receive some benefit in pollinated plants, but it's unlikely to be a direct economic one.\n Comment: That would sound like something a good neighbor would do. Just like the bees and flowers need each other, friends and allies in a community are important too.\n Comment: Thank you!\nThis is was resolved in legal documents in Europe.\n\nHas this issue been explored in the US courts? Is the European precedent sufficient to rule on cases in the US courts.\n Comment: In most places in the U.S. you can't sue for this reason.\n\nSource: Beekeeper.\n Comment: A man of the bee law, I see. I know the best avian lawyer, should you desire to collaborate on a winged animal case and cross-pollinate ideas, if you will.\n Comment: Thanks for sharing the video! This is actually really interesting. Also, it partly solved my confusion in this case through the conversion theory. \n\nAlthough, it makes me wonder about the example of a guy's girlfriend \"borrowed\" money to gamble, and returned the same amount to him after a big win. Both cases here don't damage the ownership but make profit without the owner's consent. \n\nNot saying the guy in the bee story should be making a lawsuit. But I do find it very weird if you summarize the situation as above.\n Comment: Love Legal Eagle!\n Comment: Fuck that person - may their liver rot, may their brain turn to jelly, may they get lock-jaw so they starve and die - bastards!\n Comment: Well i mean bees are bees, there isn’t much the bee keeper could do except move the hives, though most beekeepers agree to give you free honey and stuff in exchange.\n Comment: Bee prison - just like human prisons. Rip them from their warm hive, and dish out:\n\nLife sentence.\n\nForced unpaid labor\n\nRestricted movement. Good work and behavior allows for further travel to collect more nectar.\n\nWork or die.\n\nFellow inmates are also the guards.\n\nOh. Silly me.

They do compete with native bees for resources and it's species of native bees that are endangered.\n Comment: I'd be more worried about people with bee allergies. If you're bees kill somebody are you responsible for that? If your dog kills somebody you're responsible for that so I don't see why your bees would be any different.\n Comment: or they are a beenius.\n Comment: Her name is Karen.\n Comment: Given that they are writing a post like this I would imagine there might be good reason that they aren't getting any gifts from their beekeeper neighbor...\n Comment: This person would accept a jar of honey as a settlement\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: This is a truly under appreciated comment.

Thank you for that laugh!\n Comment: Yeah everyone knows Bee Movie is actually a propaganda piece made by bees to convince us that they’re necessary to our eco-system\n Comment: It’s more likely a Karen than a guy.\n Comment: I was in this half of the population until roughly nine seconds ago.\n Comment: To be fair on this, a lot of people don’t know how many things work because they don’t need to. Someone that knows how a jet engine works may not know how bees make honey or the other way around. Many get the basics of honey, bees and pollen are connected and everything in between is just wizardry.\n Comment: It's close enough that it doesn't matter really. People understand that bees make honey out of something they take from flowers. They have no need to understand the difference between nectar and pollen.\n\nThese are the same people who think honey bees are essential to our food and our food security collapses without them. When in reality honey bees mostly pollinate some luxury crops rather than our food staples.\n\nIronically wild bees, many types of hunting wasps and other insects are far more important to our crops but people act like those are just pests.\n Comment: Bees make honey from necatar.  Dude this has got to be trolling or he as dumb as a turd with corn.\n Comment: What do they use the pollen for, if not for honey?\n Comment: Everyone know that the elves make honey. Bees are nasty wannabeeeees that just steel the credit.\n Comment: I think they are already escaped convicts as they are already wearing stripes.\n Comment: Steal pollen, believe it or not, jail.\n Comment: A fel-honey\n Comment: Does someone know her onlyfans?\n Comment: I thought that was an Aqua Teen Hunger Force hat for way too long.\n Comment: I was thinking it's the other way around.  Neighbor has bees, so this guy plants flowers so he has something to complain about.  He spends $200 to plant flowers, so he can be mad about $4 worth of honey he's not getting.\n Comment: Honey, I’ve combed through the posts of the hive minded people here and think that neighbor should buzz off to market, set up a stall next to his queen bee of a pollen-stealing neighbor and insist on getting in on the sweet nectar of the profits.\n Comment: As aggravated as she is, she should just leave it all beehind\n Comment: It's none of their bees-kness\n Comment: So confused… is this a pun or did you accidentally misspell “behave?”\n Comment: At least 2, maybe 3\n Comment: Migratory bee keeping is primarily for pollination of fruit trees and other crops, without which no fruits will be produced. Many vegetables need pollination to produce. Bees are trucked thousands of miles and a high price per colony is paid for this service.  Without pollination by bees no seeds will be produced by annual flowers and they will gradually disappear and need to be replaced by store bought seeds or seedlings. Many other insects and even birds take nectar too so OP must first prove that the bees are the actual thieves. \n\nThe bee that stung OP most likely died defending herself from being cruelly crushed. OP should be charged with animal cruelty and perpetuation of death of livestock even if OP was a minor at the time. There is no statute of limitations on MURDER!:)\n Comment: Yasss Queeeeeen!\n Comment: But do keep in mind that it's not like he's relying on the efforts of the gardener. If the gardener decided to remove the garden, the beekeeper would be no worse for the wear, because the bees would just go find other flowers.\n\nReframing the situation here from the beekeeper's perspective, he might wonder why he's now on the hook because someone nearby decided they wanted a garden.\n Comment: its kind of odd how this is protected but if a bird drops a tomato seed in your property and it grows, you can be sued for having a plant that is bred growing on your property\n Comment: I would but I'm concerned about the size of my hands\n Comment: Ok bees are bees which is why I specified an unnatural amount, but at some point I'd your job hobby affects my time at home chilling I have to do something about it, you wouldn't be ok if I was listening to music insanely loud would you\n Comment: I'd be cool with a jar of free honey.\n Comment: It sure seems like these assaults are sexual in nature to me! I've seen some footage of what these bees do and I would definitely call it rape! Why hasn't 911 been called?

I have probably unlearned this falsehood, half a dozen times over the course of my life, and then forgotten I'd unlearned it each time... -\\_- I was once again in the half of the population that believed it, too, until, as Wangledoodle says, \"nine seconds ago\" :P (though probably more like a minute, now, considering how slowly I type). :P\n Comment: Haha, me too. But for those err, who have no idea what you're talking about, could you explain. Not for me, of course. For those who don't know the honey-pollen connection.\n Comment: The more you know about one thing, the less you know about everything else\n Comment: That's fair, but my issue is that I feel like people learn this falsehood in their formative years from teachers who SHOULD know better.\n Comment: Pollen is food for them and their young and queen, Nectar is for the bee, and honey from nectar is a store cupboard essential after hibernation.\n\nPollen that falls off the bee whilst it’s collecting pollen pollinates the plant.\n Comment: How do we find these escabees? I have spoken to my nervous contact in Russia, it's the cagey bee.\n Comment: ![gif](giphy|26ghbWoXv3G6ypo8o)\n Comment: onlybees\n Comment: Better would be Adam Flymans OF, since his operation he has a pretty impressive pecker.\n Comment: Me too, asking for a friend...\n Comment: R34\n Comment: I have a neighbor that has bees.\n\nMy yard has a large section that can’t be mowed, so it’s just covered in wildflowers. I always had bumble bees in that area.\n\nI didn’t think much of my neighbor’s honeybees until I planted a few raspberry bushes.\n\nNow every summer I have hundreds of super chill honey bees AND bumble bees, and loads of raspberries thanks to my neighbor’s bees.\n\nHe sells his honey at a local market and I always grab a jar, it’s fun knowing the honey came partially from my own yard, and it supports my neighbor who’s hobby ensures I don’t have to buy raspberries from the store during the summer.\n\nEveryone wins.\n Comment: It would beehoove him to be less sting-y\n Comment: Bees-(k)Ne(e)s(s)\nI'm high as balls and it makes sense for now\n Comment: I’ve heard estimates of maybe even 4\n Comment: Not all agricultural crops require bees for pollination. In fact, originally, migratory beekeeping wasn't paid. Those who do are based on mutual agreement, which is clearly lacking here. \n\nSecond, the garden can't maintain the flower based on bees alone all year round. They have their season. It is quite common that the garden owner just buys seeds to replace them. \n\nFinally, what you all seem to forget is it is a mutual benefit relationship between bees and plants. It's not one way. Plants rely on bees and vice-versa. But in this scenario, if the garden owner does the replant from store-bought seed, it is not mutual benefit anymore.\n\nSo if the garden owner is maintaining everything, it does look like the bee keeper is taking advantage. Can you say for sure that the neighbor didn't start raising bees because of the garden? The honey production is good enough for sale.\n\nThe bottom line is that we don't know details like the actual scale of the garden, its maintenance, geometric location, etc. This one-side hate to gardener is hardly justified.\n Comment: But he is somewhat relying on the efforts of the gardener.  If this Gardner pulls up roots and removes his gardener the bees would have to forage further in search of pollen.  This can have multiple adverse effects to the beekeeper; Reduced output and a change in flavor profile of the honey.  There is an argument to be made that the harder net is due compensation, if not legally at least neighborly.   Their settlement request is in the rant, “not even offered a jar”.   If this was r/amianasshole my vote would be ESH\n Comment: That's a myth.\n Comment: Prove it. I keep bees, I know. There are 16 species of bee on the endangered list. Honey Bees are not one of them. Years ago the Varroa Mite was a leading cause of Colony Collapse Disorder and many thought the honey bee was in danger of becoming endangered. We have new methods of controlling the Varroa Mite now and there are currently more honey bees than during the time just before CCD became widespread.\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/09/18/why-the-honey-bee-apocalypse-is-based-on-a-lie/\n Comment: More than one kind of bee lmao\n Comment: Pollen?

I just thought it was funny everyone here immediately said “guy” when to me I think of someone saying something so stupid and ridiculous as this about flowers has to be a typical Karen.\n Comment: You have WPM of 58? That's damn impressive.\n Comment: I think the only reason I remembered it from grade school was I thought it was odd the pistil sounds much more like the male element...I didn't get any closer to normal as I got older🤷🏻‍♂️\n Comment: Bees take nectar from flowers, eat the nectar, then vomit up honey\\*.\n\nThe pollen gets stuck to the bee while she is collecting the nectar, then gets transferred to the next flower when the bee goes to collect nectar from that one.\n\n\\* More or less.\n Comment: So you’re saying that I must be a God-like genius in something? That’s good to know, but I wonder what that is.\n Comment: “Jack of all trades, master of none.” Not original to my grandmother, but one of her favorites. I get it more and more as I get older, lol\n Comment: thanks pops.\n Comment: Oh, this comment is just beeutiful!\n Comment: Maybe this is a weird question, but does the honey have a slight raspberry flavor/smell? \n\nI’ve always wondered if the actual plant that the bee gets its material from dictates the final product-honey\n Comment: Tree fitty\n Comment: my brother in christ, the mad gardener can also get bees if she wants honey. They can also put together all the effort of maintaining a colony and dealing with collecting honey from the product of her own flowers. If you want your flower's pollen all to yourself, get your own bees. Except bees can't really be owned by anyone, because they are bees. Which is the bloody point that you missed.\n Comment: was it?  did it not also happen with grass?\n\nedit, guess you were right. google shows nothing, so much nothing that the results are only a single page and they stray far away from the topic of tomatos\n Comment: I just knew bees are endangered now i looked it and  honey Bee is not but several others are.\nLearned something today, thanks.\n Comment: Honey bees aren't even native to NA, right? They are an invasive species that killed off some of the older pollinating species of insects if i remember that long ago rabbit hole correctly?\n Comment: I think I know what movie you’re quoting but I’m Not Sure.\n Comment: Jewel Akens beat them to it: Birds and the Bees (and the flowers and the trees)\n Comment: Never heard of them before, now following on SoundCloud. 🎵👍\n Comment: But what IS brawndo\n Comment: Oh. I only meant I agreed w you, lol\n Comment: meh... closer to 45 while blind typing on this keyboard...  I wasn't being precise when I said \"a minute now\", just rough estimating it \\^\\^\n Comment: Bees also deliberately collect nectar which is also stored in their combs and eaten. If you see a bee in flight in summer you can sometimes see it stuck to their back legs like balloon pants.\n Comment: Honey is basically bee puke.\n Comment: We always called honey “bee spit”🤷‍♀️. I don’t know…is it  violent Vomit?\n Comment: So what do they do with the pollen?\n Comment: You’re grandma is a smart lady!\n Comment: Contact the FBI and see if they will set up a sting operation.\n Comment: The honey won’t smell like raspberrys but the plants they collect the nectar from does indeed change the taste of honey. So honey from a forest, field with canola or flowers all are different.\n Comment: Not necessarily a raspberry taste, but honey does taste different depending on the source. Like, wildflower honey tastes different from sage honey.\n Comment: Good reference\n Comment: So you are saying any resource you are not using, anybody else can come in and just take it?\n\nAnd by your logic, any crime bosses wouldn't be criminal. They mostly asked others to do it anyway.\n\nThe beekeeper could be the only human who financially benefits from it, and the garden owner obviously doesn't like that nor bees. But somehow, the garden owner is the bad guy here.\n Comment: Look, I'm not exactly a fan or Bayer or Monsanto, but this has been greatly exaggerated and taken out of context. The lawsuits Monsanto has brought against some farmers are against those who grew their seeds without accepting the licensing agreements that come with it.\n\nThere is a shit ton of misinformation on the subject and it's a bit discouraging to have to debunk it all the time, as someone who is a beekeeper, already dealing with all sorts of misinformation about bees.\n Comment: It's Idiocracy! Basically a documentary of America today.\n Comment: They have one of the greatest Christmas songs of all time.\n Comment: It..

        "title": "Please be brutally honest about beekeeping!",
        "text": "How rewarding/frustrating is this hobby?  My wife and I are interested in getting into beekeeping as a hobby (no more than a couple hives). We are avid vegetable gardeners, who grow fruit trees, berries, herbs, and flowers as well on our 1/2 acre suburban property in the northeast.  We also do lots of food preserving and fermenting as well. Beekeeping seems like a natural fit with our interests. I’m reading books, watching videos and have joined the local beekeepers club. I’m learning about all of the diseases and pests and lost hives that seem to be pretty common as well as the initial investment. I’m a little concerned because virtually nobody around me cares for their own property, and they all seem to spray the crap out of them with chemicals.  In a nutshell, please tell me about your experience with this hobby.\n\nEDIT: I can’t believe the number of great answers I’ve gotten so far.  Thank you so much. I appreciate it. This is an amazing community.\n Comment: If you invest the time to actually learn how to bee-keep properly through a 10+ hour class, and are diligent in caring for the hive and treating for mites, you will find the hobby far more rewarding than frustrating. I find most folks who struggle are the ones who piece-meal their education and miss important bits.\n Comment: We keep bees and are urban, feel free to ask me any questions you’ve got. \n\nOur next door neighbors were fogging for mosquitos and we had to talk to them about it. It was tough to gear up to do but it went really well. We were just going to ask them to let us know when they were fogging so we could close the hives but instead, they cancelled entirely when they found out the fog was bad for bees - the company had said it was “safe“ and we had to tell them otherwise. I think a lot of the bad practices you see are ignorance, not bad intentions. \n\nWe give honey and candles made from our wax to our neighbors. We also checked with our direct neighbors before we got the bees to make sure no one had a serious allergy.\n Comment: You can make a small fortune in beekeeping. You have to start with a large fortune. But if you stick to it, it gets smaller pretty quickly.\n Comment: It's one of the most worthwhile and fulfilling experiences I have access to in modern life.\n\nIt won't make you lots of money. It won't free up more time for social life. But when you invest time and effort into honeybees it feels like you are serving a cause much greater than yourself.\n Comment: If you keep up to 5 hives, its really fun. If u keep more than that, its fun but way more tiring.\n Comment: Best hobby I've ever picked, brings me so much peace and joy.\n Comment: If you're avid gardeners I encourage you to start keeping mason, leaf cutter and bumble bees.  They require minimal maintenance, yet are very fun to watch and beneficial for produce.  Also, there are some cool DIY nesting types of domiciles you can put together if you like tinkering around. However, no honey.\n\n Honey beekeeping can be a delicate balance to keep depending on your area and climate, but very rewarding once you figure it out, sometimes it takes a few years of trial and error.\n Comment: Stressful, expensive but incredibly rewarding - not in terms of finances but knowing you’ve done well and got your bees through winter, the check after a split seeing a queen cell and then 3+ weeks later eggs showing you’ve raised a mated Queen who is laying well.\n Comment: More education, time, dollars, mechanical ability, and storage space than you can imagine.  It’s like any livestock.  Some hives will do good, some poorly, some will die.  Every year brings different challenges.   You have to be able to fail miserably and be able to put it behind you.  \n\nI’ve seen no studies but the common wisdom is that there is an 80% dropout rate after two years.   Typically a beginner starts with too few hives. The hive(s) die two winters in a row.  They’re done and out of beekeeping.  \n\nBest advice is to take a class.  One that has “hive openings” so you get some hands on experience in an apiary.\n Comment: If they are spraying of the crap of out short grass, your bees won’t have any interest in landing in that anyway. You have enough space for at least a couple of hives, and suburban properties can be great because there’s such a variety of forage blooming at all different times.\n\nDiseases and pests and lost hives mainly happen to people who don’t test or treat for mites. It’s honestly not that hard to avoid. Keep in mind you see a hugely disproportionate number of people reporting lost hives. People don’t post as much when things are going according to plan. I’m in a Facebook group for koi ponds, and half the posts are “all my fish died! Look at all their dead bodies!” But I have koi in my back yard, and they are doing great, just like my bees.\n\nIf you’re serious gardeners, you’re not strangers to some hard work and elbow grease.\n\nIf you try this for a year or two and don’t like it, you can just sell your stuff.\n\nDefinitely don’t go into it thinking you will make money, though, unless you think you might eventually want to do it on a larger scale than what your half acre can handle.\n Comment: It can be work, and costly (especially at the beginning). Most important thing is to threat for varroa. Don't fall into the treatment free echo chambers, they might be lucky for a year or two but varroa will come. Having your own honey is quite rewarding, imo.\n Comment: I am going to be honest that if I were in an urban area and all of my neighbors sprayed I wouldn’t bother with beekeeping. I have 5 hives (one died over this winter) and we are very similar in interests. We have a 2.5 acre garden every year, preserve, have fruit trees. You’re looking at $500+ to get started. We do not have close neighbors at all and lost a hive 3 years ago to the closest spraying their flowers.\n Comment: It’s an expensive hobby. Try to do some hands on practice.\n Comment: I think for me winters are the hardest part.  They are a months long test of your practices leading up to the winter and outside of a few interventions you can mostly just watch as your efforts lead to success or failure.  The more you do it the more successful you become, but for me the memories of past failures still cause me a bit of worry during the wintering period.  Zone 6B, your mileage may vary depending on zone.\n Comment: Very rewarding. More than very frustrating. The only hobby I was willing to give up on, in like, ever.\n Comment: I can tell you I was super anxious at the beginning. 3 years in and I’m finally enjoying it. If you really care about keeping them and not just having them you will have those moments. \nTake some classes. Find one that does some hands on training. \nEducate yourself. \nAll beekeepers have their own ways. Trust your gut sometimes but gather as much information as you can. \nFind a mentor who successfully keeps bees. \nIf I see a video with a beekeeper who smokes the heck out of the bees, I don’t move on.\n Comment: Brutally honest? Your first year will be an absolute shitshow. You’re gonna think you’re on top of everything only to realize you’re a month behind on everything. You’ll regroup over that winter and have a better grip (and more fun) the second. Come year 3, you’ll be in the groove. Hook up with a local club or a good mentor and they’ll be there to help keep you off the ledge. Good luck and never stop asking questions!\n Comment: I am a suburban beekeeper in the Northeast and I keep bees strictly as a hobby. I also garden, I grow mostly native plants/flowers but also a small amount of vegetables.  I really enjoy having them around, and working them is fun (for the most part!) Even just watching them is relaxing. It can be frustrating, but I've found it to be more rewarding. My first year, I started with 2 hives that expanded to 3 due to a swarm, but by winter's end, only one had survived. I purchased another nuc and split my surviving hive in the spring totaling 3 hives last summer; this spring, I have 2 hives that have survived. I plan to split both of those, and expand to 4 this summer but that's about as many as I think I can handle, and if my current trajectory stays, I'll end up with 3 next year, barring any disasters. 😊 It's important to recognize that you may have to experiment a bit or lose a little, but overall it's a really nice feeling to see honeybees on your plants, and it sounds like your garden would provide a great variety of forage for them. I have had one bad experience with pesticides, where a bunch of foragers from one of my hives died, but mostly neighbors and people in the area think it's cool. It's sort of seeped into people's minds that bees are important and most people that I talk to in my neighborhood are really interested in the hives. Plus if *they* have gardens, they'll appreciate the bees pollinating their flowers/veggies/trees! As for keeping them alive, definitely treat for mites (I'm in NY and I start in late August) and proper winter prep is key. (I like David Burns' YouTube channel - he's a master apiarist and his advice has never steered me wrong, especially with winter prep!) When purchasing bees, I've found that overwintered nucs tend to be more successful - my one hive that's been going for 2 years now was an overwintered nuc, and the other hive that survived the winter was the split I made from that hive. If you're in NY, I'd recommend Hudson Valley Bee for overwintered nucs, but the important thing is getting local bees.\nOverall, I definitely find it to be more rewarding than frustrating, and I don't even sell the honey or anything, I just give it away as gifts.\n Comment: Bees are livestock that require as much attention as any other livestock — health checks, medication for varroa mites, housing. They take work and time. They are also fun if you have the time.\n Comment: It’s more addictive than Heroin.  Sorta kidding.  It’s the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.  I’m in a unique situation and my hives are located at a community garden.  Trust me Bees are the most amazing of creatures.  The learning never stops and knowing what an important role bees take in our lives just adds to the positivity.  1 of every 3 bites of food comes from the bees 🐝. I’ve been in for 3 years.  I actually spent my entire Sunday reading a new bee book today.  Please go ahead and start your hives this spring. Bee distribution is gonna be starting in mid April- may.  Get your plans made now.\n Comment: Love it and hate it.\nHives (bees) are not cheap and there are a number of things that can take down a hive.\nVarroa, diseases, late season swarming, hard winters (rollercoaster weather).\nEquipment isn’t hugely expensive.\nTime investment isn’t huge but if you are good at routine and keeping records that will help.\nKnowing what you are going to do with all that honey will help.\nWe ended up in a spot where we needed to start selling to cover some of costs. Now people expect us to have honey which is a bit of unexpected pressure.\nThat said, knowing the bees are out pollinating our neighbours crops gives me a good feeling.\nSitting outside a hive in the morning or at sunset when there is lots of traffic is simply amazing.\n Comment: I had 10 hives at one point. It became frustrating and I couldn't keep up. I am like you, I have a vegetable garden, fruits trees and berry bushes.. So on. I've decided to only keep two hives and to do as little as possible. That does not mean no treatment, but I will only open a hive when I need to and not when I want to. It also means I invested in expensive equipment to make things easier and faster to do.\n Comment: Sometimes it’s beautiful. It can be peaceful watching your bees do all the things and my garden is very productive with the bees around. I’ve learned so much and the honey is delish! But sometimes the bees are dicks. They’re mad for no reason. I had a bee fly straight into my face and sting me above my eye when I was just walking by. It costs a fair amount to get started, too. I’m a few years in and don’t intend to give it up, so I’ve definitely found the balance weighs more heavily on the rewarding side!\n Comment: You'll never have enough equipment and even when you follow the instructions to the letter things will go wrong and you won't know why. It's fun though. Just don't ever think of bees as your pets or friends. You can't see them as individual creatures as opposed to a collective super organism.\n Comment: I did it for 4 years. It's expensive to get started. I got the bees, fed them sugar, treated them for mites, the whole nine yards. The hives looked good. I didn't take any honey so they could overwinter. All four years the hives were decimated by yellow jackets.\n Comment: Just started this year. Urban backyard keepers, started with 2 and ended up with 4. Did a lot of reading beforehand and got a lot of information from my grandfather as a kid, some of which is no longer applicable. You don't need a course, just read a lot and pay attention to what you learn. Watch YouTube videos. Paul Kelly from Guelph University has a lot of videos which are absolutely awesome, just know some won't apply depending on your climate. \n\nIt's been very rewarding and a great learning experience. I can't wait to do inspections and I'm really eager to start a new season this year. Researching new techniques and queen breeding etc etc etc. Always more to learn.\n\nJust go for it.\n Comment: We actually haven’t bought a hive or bees. My husband caught a swarming population in our garden and borrowed a beehive to catch them. None of our nearby beekeepers were missing any so hubby build an African hive and he picked up another swarm so now we have 2.\n Comment: I took a year long college course, with all but 2 classes being field study. Made wonderful friends, and community contacts. I worried all summer, fall and especially winter about my wee girls, with names and personalities. I nearly put my back out lifting a hive box full of honey and bees, more than once. My one hive first harvest of 20 pints cost me about $4,000 (start up costs). I love them and wouldn't trade the experience for the world. I can confidently say I will have bees to the end.\n Comment: I keep bees in my backyard in Southern California in a suburban area. \n\nIt is a bit of money to get started and there is a real learning curve.  You can't take all the advice on the internet directly, as so much depends on your local weather and flora. \n\nThere can be frustration when you lose a hive, the colony goes queenless, or any of the other problems you might run into. Dealing with dead/dying bees is demotivating. \n\nThat said, it is tremendously rewarding to learn a new skill and see yourself improve and to see your bees doing well.  Opening a hive to find a strong brood pattern and having a low varroa count feels great. \n\nPersonally, giving friends and family honey that our bees made and I harvested is the best feeling. Most people are in awe and understand that it is a gift you literally sweated for and is unique.  They appreciate a simple one pound bottle of honey far more than most other things you could give them.\n Comment: It’s equal parts!\n Comment: The highs for me are seeing hives grow, develop and then reaping a bumper crop of honey. The lows are aggressive bees, losing hives to mites and stings.\n Comment: Many local farm supply stores cater to the beekeeping community.  Some also offer classes.  That can also be a great place to find a mentor to ask questions after the class is done.\n\nMy wife and I started about 8 years ago.  Our first year we killed the queen when trying to install her into the package we had purchased.  Quickly replaced her and did our best to grow that hive and provided plenty of food to help them survive our rough winters ( northern Utah).  They didn't survive.\n\nKept on trying.  We've taken lots of classes. Last year we sent 44 hives to California for three almond pollination.  It is fun and rewarding but also lots of work.\n Comment: I just randomly had the inspiration to get into this as well. My family lives on about 6 acres in Central Florida, my stepdad who is a landscaper/botanist has done some amazing things with the property since living there. There is a large barn toward the rear of the property for equipment, and I currently need a hobby since leaving my job to take care of our new baby as my wife has a very successful career in advertising. \n\nI do worry about one adjacent property though, it was a residential home but a few years ago was sold and renovated as a veterinary office. Separated by a dense tree line. Perhaps they would have a problem with it.\n Comment: My husband and I have a hive3 yrs now. We have been treatment free and mostly hands off . We do inspections regularly and harvest extra honey. It’s been easy. But we also don’t have the normal stacking hives.\n Comment: It’s expensive.\n Comment: I love this hobby but keep in mind that it won’t be cheap. \n\nIt would take 2000 to get started with hives, classes, equipment etc. then you gotta buy/borrow the stuff to harvest them. \n\nAnnually, you have to buy medicine, food, wintering stuff. Etc etc. \n\nIt’s not the cheapest hobby but super fun\n Comment: I'm blunt tool of unkindly mess. Sharp in my eyesight. Steady with I stand. I recommend you cool off in river before harvesting honey. Makes you better at doing it trust.\n Comment: I love it. Probably one of the most rewarding hobbies. After years of beekeeping, still learning new things regularly and still perfecting my method and trying new things. \n\nBee products are awesome too. You can make all types of things cosmetics, foods, mead, candles etc. \n\nIt scales pretty well in the sense that you can start with 2 hives and then gradually grow your apiary. There's ways to do it on the cheap, and you can make it very expensive. I would advise you to do a beekeeping course first or in the very least get an experienced beekeeper to mentor you. I feel like anyone can learn how to keep bees, but you do have to put some time and effort in.\n Comment: Watch https://youtu.be/mR8SsncIm_0?si=7k0wNmg-HotrapBR. Gain a lot of knowledge. WARNING it is addictive. I like 8 Frame Langstroth and Use the 8-Frame Ultimate Cypress Hive Stand with West Beetle Trap & IPM Board Select Assembled from Dadant (I use diatomaceous earth in the tray) just for future note. There is nothing like your own backyard honey. I sell out just with people at work . In addition I have also a couple of videos you might like https://youtu.be/FoGCRwD5Bbc?si=gOiy5xBsM812rriT\n Comment: Got a recommended class?\n Comment: this 100%. adopt a mindset of lifelong learning, access high-quality information and be diligent in your care of the bees and you will be fine.\n Comment: Lol! \n\nWe have a hops farm and I tell everyone- the quickest way to become a millionaire growing hops is to start as a billionaire.\n Comment: Lol\n Comment: 🤣\n Comment: This is what my flight instructor told me when I was just starting on my PPL! (Aviation, not beekeeping)\n Comment: Ain't that the truth. My hobbies are veggie gardens, building classic cars, and beekeeping - I used to be pretty well off.\n Comment: The only answer. ☝️\n Comment: If it's worth anything to ya beekeepers tend to live quite a bit longer than average for some reason.\n Comment: There are three local beekeepers I'm friends with who went full time in beekeeping just this past year, a few blew up on social media and the other supplies queens. They do really well.\n Comment: I love a summer day sitting just to side of my bee-yard where the sun catches them flying in and out of the yard.  So much peace and joy.\n Comment: These solo bees actually do more pollinating than honeybees was my understanding\n Comment: I love this comment and I’m so happy to see it here.\n Comment: Yeah, *definitely* don't think it's a big money-maker. Maybe you'll squeeze out a few $s as your skills improve in later years. It's more about the hobby and Xmas presents for me, but I only have 1 hive.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I'm in 7a and lost my hive last winter when it dropped into the single digits. Going to insulate this year and am thinking about a mat heater to assist.\n Comment: I agree! I never felt more down than in fall, because there's nothing more I can do, after spending a summer getting to know these ladies, and not knowing if they'll make it through the winter.\n Comment: This is so true. Last year was my first year and... ugh. I'm more allergic to stings than the average human, which made me jumpy, which make me over smoke, which made them dicks, but EVEN STILL I sort of fell in love with them. Going into September I knew they wouldn't make it through the winter because of mite mismanagement, and I was genuinely devastated. Here I was, my first year, full of optimism, I even named my queens, got to know their personalities, and I KNEW they were going to die. I was so depressed, I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to do it again this summer. But, I signed up for sophomore beekeeping, and as time went on, I got more and more excited to try again. Anyway. Yes. Year one was a shitshow. And a heartbreak! Looking forward to year three.\n Comment: Thank you.\n Comment: Thank you. I’m on Long Island. Not sure if Hudson Valley delivers here but I will look into it.\n Comment: $4k ??? Is your hive 100 stories high with a trillion bees lol?? That’s crazy expensive.\n Comment: I doubt very much that they would take issue with it. Just go talk to them and make sure you give them some honey when you get it.  My neighbor was thrilled when I told her about the bees.\n Comment: Thank you\n Comment: University of Montana has a highly respected online series of classes: Apprentice and Journeyman. Maybe even Master.\n Comment: Try to take a class in your region. Beekeeping in dry, wet, hot, cold, tropical, etc climates is very different so you want to take a class that will teach you how to take care of your bees in your climate.\n Comment: Check with your local bee club.\n Comment: Look for a class from Cooperative Extension in your state so you can go in person. You’ll not regret it!\n Comment: .. must be all the stings to the head   :-)\n Comment: I read somewhere it's the longest lived profession per capita.\n Comment: Absolutely agree\n Comment: Plenty of money in beekeeping just not on smaller scale. It’s all about diversifying the products you sell and produce\n Comment: I haven't tried it, but I read some good stuff about it. What do you use to do it?\n Comment: Insulation is fine and works for some people, but heaters are considered a bad idea.  They will trick the hive into breaking cluster when outside temperatures don't support flying, which can result in other problems.  Insulation makes it easier for bees to retain their own heat, and done properly can aid in moisture mitigation (creating intentional cold spots for spots that won't affect clustered bees)\n Comment: Usually moisture is the problem, not the cold.\n Comment: Wow!  thanks for sharing.  I need honesty.\n Comment: Oh no, they don't deliver. You'd have to pick them up, but I'm positive that there are apiaries that sell bees on Long Island. I've never tried getting bees in the mail, but I know most \"local\" places prefer you pick up. And then you know where your bees are coming from.\n Comment: No. I'm in Canada, stuff is expensive here. That is equipment for 3 full Langstroth  hives of 2 deeps and 2 mediums each with lids, screened bottom boards, hard covers plus extra boxes and shims to be put together as needed. Full veil/suit/gloves. Tools (smoker, pellets, hive tool, frame grabber and hanger for side when working in hives). Feeder buckets-  (several as I hated the first ones I bought), queen excluders, bee brush, capping scraper and capping knife. Bee sugar and fondant for off season. Mite treatments for 2 hives for 2 seasons. 4 frame honey extractor, buckets, screens, jars, bins. 2 nucs of live bees from 2 different apiaries. Beekeeping club fees. College tuition fees. I've probably forgotten a few odds and ends. That doesn't include the wood frames I have the hives set up on because I used leftover wood I had. I only took honey from one hive the first year because they didn't all make enough for both themselves and me. Getting started with all new equipment is expensive but now that I have the base, it will be much less moving forward. Once I have drawn out frames, the bees will have much more time to make honey in the following summers.\n Comment: Thanks for the tip!\n Comment: That's great advice and I hear it everywhere but...\n\n1. That doesn't answer the question, and \n\n2. I am not getting involved with my local bee club... I'm in a rural area of Texas and every club or activity around me just so happens to take place inside a church where part of the club activities include \"spiritual fellowship\" and start with a prayer and a pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag so no... I'm also not driving an hour to get to the nearest non-church-affiliated club.\n Comment: Agreed!\n Comment: Maybe the stings, the power-lifting, the sunshine or something in the hive air.\n Comment: Yeah, good point on the scale. How many hives would you need to make $50,000/yr?  Like 200 hives? \n\n$40,000 = $200 x 200hives pollination fees/yr\n$20,000 = $100 x 200hives net honey revenue\n-$10,000 = $50 x 200hives for expenses\n----‐-------------\n$50,000 / yr\n Comment: Oh, I hadn't thought of that. No heater then! Do you do anything specific to help them?\n Comment: Going to try the quilt boards this winter and see if that helps.\n Comment: Ok. Thanks.\n Comment: I totally get this frustration. The bee folks around me are feeling this same frustration. The three big apiaries in the area are all part of devout churches and include worship as part of keeping bees, it's so ridiculous. The one's I've talked to are in the process of forming their own non-religious solution. This stuff has to be created. \n\nA lot of locals connect online.\n Comment: I’m so sorry you don’t have any community. That’s a hard place to be.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: You can make 50k from less then 200 that’s excessive.  Honey sells for like 20 bucks a kilo where I am in Australia\n Comment: In the past I have used quilt boards on 100% of hives.  This year due to expanded stock I decided to test hives with no quilt boards and have noticed only a small difference in early vigor so far.  The hives with quilt boards tend to be about 1 frame of bees larger as of end of February, although one was small enough that it needed boosted and I had a small amount of losses spread across both configurations.  \n\nSo my general conclusion so far is that quilt boards are good at smaller scale but end up being extra equipment to store if your operation expands.  I have also noticed that my hives on lower pallets tend to have some ant living in the quilt board, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  \n\nAbsolute essential winter equipment for me is a mouse guard and hives with low mites in August and good weight by October.\n Comment: I have been happy with moisture boards, but plenty of ventilation is good too.\n Comment: Thanks for the understanding, glad I'm not the only one.\n Comment: Thank you! Truly. We'd love to be involved but realistically we're kinda stuck on our own. We have a virtual relationship with a supplier over 100 miles away but that's as close as we have to a community or local support... hence looking for online classes matters to us.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: How many hives would you need in Australia to clear $50k/yr, approximately?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: How long is a piece of string? There are so many different factors I can’t answer that here without writing a novel\n Comment: EDIT: the deleted comment above was saying that my desire to enjoy beekeeping without needing to enter a church, participate in religious rituals or swear allegiance to a state was \"a strange hill to die on.\"\n\nSeems like strange things to make mandatory parts of a hobby... state loyal fascism and religious fanaticism.\n\nIf they're not fascists and fanatics, then why make it a hill that others need to die on, why not just get rid of the rituals? Because the rituals are non-negotiable.\n\nWhat kind of people refuse to negotiate? Fascists and fanatics.\n Comment: It’s not mandatory no one makes you participate. Plenty of people don’t bow during prayer.\n Comment: I hear you, and I'm simply voting with my feet. If it's a non-negotiable part of the agenda then it is, for all intents and purposes, mandatory. Just because you're not compelled to pray out loud doesn't make it any less of a nuisance to those of us who would rather not have to sit through it.\n\nIf you don't mind the church setting, the ritual prayer, and the pledge to the state, then imagine how you would feel if it took place inside a satanic temple, and the schedule included an unholy invocation and an oath to communism... because that's what it feels like to those of us who value freedom more than being silent and complicit in perpetuating this religious fanaticism and state-loyal fascism.\n\nI just asked about online courses and didn't mean to get on a soap box about it, but since the conversation went this way I'll finish by saying that I was raised in Texas and I've just become sick to my stomach of the religious and political virtue signaling thrown into every aspect of public life. So when I say I'm voting with my feet, I mean that I hope the attendance rates at organizations that put fanatical prayers and fascist pledges on their agendas for non-religious and non-political events should drop to zero... I can't allow my club dues to go towards supporting that stuff, so I boycott them and hope they go the way of the dinosaurs.",

        "text": "\n Comment: It looks like honey but it’s not. It’s nectar. The combs aren’t capped so it’s not ready yet. It’s tempting, but you’ve got to let those bees do their work before you take.\n Comment: Bees looking at him like \"What the fuck are you doing to our honeycomb?!\"\n Comment: bee: uhm, excuse me what the  actual fuck are you doing in my house-  \nedit: thanks for the updates this the biggest record of upvotes i ever gotten thank you all :D\n Comment: Would be much more satisfying if it was a little longer\n Comment: What they don’t show you is that it can destroy the comb. That stuff’s wax, it’s not rubber. It _is_ flexible, but not that much. This just creates more work for the bees, as well as potentially really damaging an already established frame. Granted, doing this once _probably_ won’t do significant damage, but this is purely for the aesthetic; real beekeepers don’t actually do this, it just needlessly fucks up a perfectly good frame\n Comment: Sigh. That’s not honey. That’s uncapped nectar. If it were honey, the bees would have capped it and the beekeeper would have had to cut off the cover with a hot knife. Then the wax would be much more rigid. Also, you can see what looks to be capped brood in the background on the same frame. \n\nSuper cool video though. Those look like sweet girls.\n Comment: (a) Wow that's not a good way of getting that out, you're just mashing the comb and leaving a bunch of \"honey\" behind, while also destroying more cell structure than necessary.\n\n(b) It's not even capped yet, so as far as I know from keeping bees, that's not proper honey yet.\n Comment: That’s not honey (yet). It’s still nectar, and too watery, since the bees haven’t capped it. Basically someone is destroying honeycomb for no reason.\n Comment: He's obviously beekeeping age.\n Comment: bees :\" Not cool bro \"\n Comment: None of the honey being scooped is capped yet, meaning that it isn’t ready. It not being ready means there is still a higher content of water in the honey mixture making the honey susceptible to molding.\n Comment: All these people screaming about the thumbnail, I don't understand. People go to nail salons to get acrylics, but somehow the natural nail is not allowed to grow out?\n Comment: Barry B.

Nectar will spoil, honey will not.\n Comment: Mmmm bee vomit.\n Comment: A horror movie for bees.\n Comment: Just a smackerel of honey.\n Comment: Those where the days, helping with collecting honey. Sticky everywhere, but we felt so rich when you have buckets of honey. Also it's a fun thing to do. Not to mention the taste. \n\nThere are a lot of satisfying jobs in beekeeping. I'm really allergic, so the day to day stuff is not my cup of tea. But the other jobs are fun!\n Comment: That's not actually honey yet. Just nectar\n Comment: I see this come up every now and again and always downvote. \n\nThis isn't honey, this is uncapped nectar and nowhere nearly as delicious or good. So scooping this is pointless. \n\nBut there is more, you are basically destroying a lot of comb which the bees will need to restore and is stupid in addition to pointless. \n\nIf you want to eat honey, wait until the frame is capped, take it out of the hive, uncap the honey and harvest it in a spinner. Afterwards, put the frame back in the hive and let the Bees do what they do best.\n Comment: Fresh bee barf is soooo good.\n Comment: It’s said they carved that themselves, from a bigger spoon\n Comment: Get outta here with your Gandalf spoon you silly wizard\n Comment: Do bees just not care that we take their honey?\n Comment: Bee: \"dude...

Or are they permanently damaged until the bees rebuild the comb? Im genuinely curious, ive seen people squeeze the whole honey comb or do similar like this with a spoon and press into it, but ive never seen what happens afterwards! Lol. I wanna know does it bounce back?\n Comment: Not much of a beekeeper.  Collecting uncapped honey.

I know some will attack if the hive is disturbed, but as far as the honey goes, do they protect it just the same?\n Comment: I love you, Bees, but I hate the aesthetics of your honeycomb design. It looks beautiful and is very clean and symmetrical but I hate your pattern of choice.\n Comment: Now I want some honey.\n Comment: Can anyone tell me if this break the honeycomb or does it just literally squeeze it out while still keeping its shape?\n Comment: r/oddlystressful\n\nEdit: oh it's a real subreddit\n Comment: Not honey. Honey is found in capped cells. That's just nectar or syrup.\n Comment: Not honey. Just nectar.\n Comment: The bees like \"Yes, Titan of the Hive.

Why do they waste such time and resources on massive surpluses?\n Comment: Beeznutz\n Comment: Hey ! Let them bee !\n Comment: Bee keeper would never do that. \n(Exept to film this)\n Comment: This is unfinished honey, it could be unpocessed nectar but there are no bees working on it, so it's probably just honey that's not evaporated enough. While still very tasty you can't store honey like this because microbes could still multiply in it and it can ferment. That's why you wait for bees to cap the honeycomb, that means it's fully processed and has an acceptable moisture level.\n Comment: That’s a stupid way to get views on TikTok or the gram. Leave it alone and harvest the whole thing after it’s capped. This is a waste.\n Comment: I still to this day don't understand how honey never became a form of currency.\n\nIt never rots or goes rancid, beekeeping is fundamental to most agriculture.\n\nFor fucks sake Tulips we're basically a form of currency in Europe for awhile.\n Comment: Good ole bee vomit/poo\n Comment: cut yo fingernails pls\n Comment: No mi casa tioooooooo\n Comment: I've always wanted to be a beekeeper just because I know how important and beneficial they are to the world.\n Comment: I wanted to see the damage to hive\n Comment: THEY HAVE NO CAPS, THEY HAVE NO CAPS\n Comment: Imagine making all this food and some fucker with a spoon just comes in\n Comment: Those bees are suprisingly calm\n Comment: Im wondering if can slip my finger in and taste it hmmmm\n Comment: Translate from Bees:\"Ayo it took me a literal year to build that shit you dickhead\"\n Comment: I heard from a totally reputable source they actually put bees in a centrifuge and make them puke it up (/silly)\n Comment: That’s not honey!\n Comment: You mean bee vomit\n Comment: That spoon is awesome.\n Comment: disgusting nails\n Comment: Can’t have shit in Detroit\n Comment: “Hey…..

You know, so the bees can use it again?\n Comment: ruining a comb for a tiktok, nice\n Comment: This is just for views, uncapped honey is never harvested due to its too high humidity level which make it to fermentate.

Or does it bounce back up like a silicone mold.\n Comment: Nothing satisfying about exploiting bees and stealing from them while native pollinators struggle.\n Comment: Can you eat it in this state, and if so, how would it taste? It still looks delicious\n Comment: I wish your comment was closer to the top. Amazing how far down I had to scroll before finding this answer.\n Comment: I like to imagine them shouting obscenities with varying accents.\n Comment: Knowing nothing about beekeeping, I’ve always wondered about the honey.

Oce of nature's wondrous masrerpieces, and he wrecks it like that. So what happens to that now? Will the bees all band together and put their expert repair-drones on the job, or it that just going to remain an indelible blight on the neighborhood, the proof of an old story about the time one of the Gods got angry?\n Comment: Strangely it’s never bothered me to eat meat but I always feel morally wrong ruining all their hard work to make honey.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: **Collecting Taxes**\n Comment: Just saw this post on r/OddlyTerrifying in the Bee reddit\n Comment: Yeah on the serious side there are other ways to get the honey without destroying their house.\n\nDoing this video stuff makes your next batch of honey come later.\n Comment: That's what she said.\n Comment: r/gifsthatendtoosoon\n Comment: I really needed to see the comb bounce back... Do they do that?\n Comment: welcome to this sub\n Comment: I wanted to know how much damage they're doing to it. Does it spring back to shape? I wanna know!\n Comment: Right in the fucking middle too. At least do it from the edge instead of like a barbarian. Not of this is satisfying and all the bee facts in the comments make me dislike the video even more. I can slide a spoon through peanut butter and it'll be more satisfying than this.\n Comment: Considering majority of the caps are already removed from the comb my guess is that this comb was going in for processing. This specific comb will likely be thrown away or cut so that it's just a peice of comb left in the frame for bees to build off.\n\nEdit: the \"dark\" honey you see is brood comb (really this whole thing is brood). It's heavy traffic area of the comb. Higher up where you see the caps is likely where you will have bee cocoons (if they look like they're rounded) else it's probably honey. The reason they're dark is due to bee poop getting stuck to the comb and not able to be cleaned out well because of how bee silk works when they're cocooned in the cell. Idk why this person is damaging a brood comb for a video but I'm sure they know what they're doing. All of the honey (dark and light) is harvestable honey. It's just the light stuff is what we're all use to.\n Comment: They look synthetic, artificial honeycombs are apparently a thing now.\n Comment: Yeah, it seems like this is just a video for internet attention. It's interesting, but i can't help but think it's a waste. I love eating honeycomb, and that is going to be pretty dang smashed up now.\n Comment: Came here for that, did some beekeeping and this is basically only for Tiktok and aesthetic, but the person is just destroying a perfectly fine frame for that...\n\nBees are using a lot of time and energy to build those combs.\n Comment: Thank you - my gf and father in law are bee keepers and neither would do this to their bees.\n Comment: No way really?\n Comment: May I ask how nectar turns to honey?\n Comment: Is the nectar like that edible, and would it taste decent?\n Comment: Good on you spotting the brood.  That egg pattern looks like that is a bad queen to me.  A healthy queen would have a much more solid pattern (every hole is filled).  This gif is a mystery.  idk what they heck they are doing.  \nSource: am beekeeper.\n Comment: Why do bees make so much honey and not give a damn about people taking it? Is it food and they just are too docile to care about their food store decreasing? Do they actually get pissed but beekeepers don't care?\n Comment: #SIGH\n Comment: Thanks fellow apiarist.  I was disappointed and looking for this comment.\n Comment: Came here looking for this comment. Looking at it and thinking, that isn't capped, so would that even be honey considering the girls haven't gotten the water content just right?\n Comment: Wow I find this much more interesting. The fact you can tell visually nectar being prepared and actual honey being made in the same frame is so cool.\n Comment: Why would he be laying it down like this?  Other side likely has uncapped nectar dripping out while this films (maybe that's intentionally done and it's going into a bucket?)\n Comment: Sigh\n Comment: Huh. I thought the comb was a pre-made one. Like a silicone one that makes the bee's job easier.\n Comment: This guy beekeepers\n Comment: Scrolled to find this comment!\n Comment: Was looking for this comment\n Comment: Pretty sure those are synthetic honeycombs. the spoon isn’t destroying anything\n Comment: Internet karma is no reason?\n Comment: Summer, I wanna fuck your dad.\n Comment: Oh *thumbnail*.

Especially when I’m teaching bc it keeps the little ones giggling and engaged.\n Comment: Look behind the spoon.\n Comment: YES. It's sweet and strong and rich.\n Comment: They really don’t. Bees naturally create an excess of honey, so as long as you are careful and aren’t being a dick to them, they’ll let you take some honey.\n Comment: Um they can be defensive because you've opened the hive. They don't really care about you taking the frames or box away as much. However, you will probably use a clearing board to empty the bees from the box. With that it's just a case of taking the box off and walking away. The issue with this though is if you do it in the day you can create a robbing frenzy where bees go nuts and are attracted to the box you're trying to move. Most beekeepers will do this in the evening due to this.\n Comment: It could be synthetic, in which case it could bounce back, but if it is natural no it will break.\n Comment: old comb can have bacteria or mold or dead bees in it.  I think you can reuse it but its better to have the bees start over to avoid causing issues with the hive.  My uncle is a beekeeper, but its been about 20 years since I helped him with extracting so my memory is really fuzzy.\n Comment: this video is more like “fuck you, bees”\n Comment: What does the comb taste like?\n Comment: OMG YES. My uncle and aunt have kept bees and bottled/sold honey for probably 45 years. My first paid job was in the extractor house when I was 16. There is truly nothing in the world like fresh pure honey.\n Comment: Nah, looks more they \"don't make the overlord mad, he'll smoke us all because of your stupidity\"\n Comment: Me. 👋\n Comment: This isn't exactly how it's done, but the idea is similar.\n Comment: It's a super frame so it's never going to be laid in.\n Comment: It would probably taste good like honey but the problem with uncapped combs is it contains too much water which makes it easy to grow mold or ferment if you’re storing it in jars. You can eat some of it but in this video they’re taking too much for a one time use so it’s not really sustainable. That’s why when you buy a jar (or bear ha) of honey, it doesn’t mold or have a yeasty/beer smell to it because they allowed the bees to finish the job first. \n\nIf the bees can’t cap their combs on their own it’s due to a moisture problem where the bees can’t get rid of excess water, which is a whole different issue. \n\nI digress so anyway, after this vid of them harvesting it too soon, they could put it back near the bees for them to eat since they eat it themselves already, or you could freeze it in portions for one time use then. But really, if you just wait a little longer for the bees to cap their combs you won’t have to worry about mold and you’ll get a better tasting, and safer way of enjoying honey vs not-yet honey.\n Comment: Agreed! I wanna try the not honey!\n Comment: SAMIR YOU ARE BREAKING THE COMB\n Comment: I like to imagine a mass destruction event. \n\nLarva just playing enjoying life with Mama Bee and a big shadow envelopes them in darkness before the screaming starts.\n Comment: One of them is for sure talking like a big bearded arab man with a deep voice\n Comment: I just imagine all stereotypical New Yorker accents\n Comment: Their epithets get increasingly colorful but all we hear is loud buzzing\n Comment: I learned from futurama that bees communicate by dancing.\n\nAlso Fry's spleen came from a guy who rode motorcycles.\n Comment: I think bees would be scarier if they all had Birmingham accents\n Comment: \"HEY, I'M BUZZIN' HERE!\"\n Comment: I'm hearing them screaming in a thick scottish brogue.\n\nI now need a Scots bee cartoon.\n Comment: These are Brooklyn bees for sure\n Comment: I FART IN YOUR GENERAL DIRECTION!\n Comment: I FART IN YOUR GENERAL DIRECTION\n Comment: Bees communicate by dancing, so maybe they are.\n Comment: >Knowing nothing about beekeeping, I’ve always wondered about the honey. Do the bees just make way more than they need?\n\nYes. The honey is their food. During the summer, they collect pollen, make honey, and store it up.  Once winter hits, they have a big stockpile of food.\n\nThe bees make extra honey because they don't know how the weather will be over the winter.\n\nBeekeepers can take the extra honey, and the bees are fine. However, the beekeeper needs to pay attention. If the winter is particularly bad, the bees won't have enough honey (because it was taken from them!)\n\nSo, sometimes, a beekeeper will need to supplement feeding with sugar water. Basically, replacing the honey they took.\n Comment: They need enough to get through the winter and poor weather. I'm sure they could also be fed sugar water if needed. Well kept bees shouldn't mind. There's no reason to make them build new honeycomb like this person's doing though. Just cut off the caps and run it through a centrifuge.\n Comment: Someone else posted. This is not honey. It's nectar. The honey is in the capped cells in the back.\n Comment: They can make more than they need when the conditions are favourable. Bees create a stockpile for the winter when there isn't a lot of food or sometimes its just a bad season. In Australia (where I used to keep bees) eucalyptus trees are an important source of food but they do not flower every year. Some years theres lots of honey, others not so much\n\nAs others have noted, you often have to supplement their honey reserves with sugar water. Almost all commercial beekeepers do this since they want to maximize the honey they can take\n\nAs a hobbyist I didnt have to feed often as I only took what I needed for my own use and to give a few kilos away to family and friends\n\nIts also important to harvest honey when they have a surplus as they will swarm more often if they have lots of honey\n Comment: Yes, as long as pollen is available they will keep making honey. There is no planning on a specific amount of honey they need, they just make as much as they can.\n Comment: honey bees make much more than they need, most bees don't make more than they need or sometimes not even more than the babies need plus one or two rainy days.  this is why we don't raise say say bumblebees for honey instead :)\n Comment: They make as much as they can so that they have a stockpile for bad weather. In the wild, they'd probably find an equilibrium as they scrounge around for good flowers all the time. In farms, the humans give them way more access to tons of flowers and the humans keep the flowers healthier and more productive than they'd be in the wild. The bees can effectively produce honey on overdrive at all times without actually ever consuming as much honey as they produce.\n\nChickens and eggs are somewhat similar. A chicken will only lay an egg if it has an abundance of food. Since humans can throw endless corn at them, farm chickens produce eggs nonstop, while a wild chicken won't lay nearly as many eggs as quickly, except for rare scenarios where there's a ton of food available all at once\n Comment: The beekeepers give the bees sugar water for substitute and the bees are fine with it. They're entirely capable of packing up and taking the whole colony if they're feeling threatened, but they tolerate the beekeepers because ultimately those hives a lot safer than any in the wild.\n Comment:  Do stores even sell 100% honey anymore?\n Comment: Nope, beekeeping involves bees making their own honeycomb and filling it with honey. It's beeswax for sure, the beekeepers just provide empty wooden frames for the bees to fill with honeycomb.\n Comment: What are you talking about? Are you just pulling this from your ass?\n Comment: I wondered because it looks kind of like silicone and the other honeycombs I’ve seen look waxy\n Comment: # \"Taxes are fucking BEE.S.\"\n\n\\- 🐝\n Comment: Holy shit that is a hilarious way to look at this!

Healthy bees overproduce, especially when they've got a bear-repelling demigod carting them between farms, and they store honey in separate areas from the eggs or general living areas. Plus, that wax isn't hard to make, it just kina comes free when you eat honey and pollen.\n Comment: We call that an alley-oop, kids.\n Comment: I tried\n Comment: **OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**OOOoooooooo!! ..... Gottem\n Comment: No they do not bounce back. Its wax, not rubber\n Comment: Nah there's nothing left but a path of destruction in it's wake\n Comment: Nope, the spoon destroyed the comb. When bees fill honey comb, they cap it with wax. In normal harvesting, the wax cap is cut off and the comb is spun to remove the honey, leaving the comb mostly intact so the bees don't have to waste resources rebuilding it. It would never be scooped out like that.\n Comment: This comb looks synthetic to me, like it's silicone or something. Idk if that's a real thing they do, but I was expecting to see it bounce back as well.\n\nNormally they're just wax. You can buy some and eat it. Goes great with cheese plates.\n Comment: Not a beekeeper, but I don't think so. I'm pretty sure they get destroyed when you harvest honey.\n Comment: What’s even funnier is that the last thing you want to do is to encourage the bees to build comb in anything but exactly the nice pattern proved by the frame, or anywhere else besides the frame. My bro’s a beekeeper, and having worked on the hive a few times, I can tell you few things are more annoying than having to deal with their bullshit selves basically gluing different parts of the hive together because they decided to build a bridge of honeycomb across multiple sections\n Comment: eh its fine, yeah the comb will be damaged but bees build that stuff so damn fast it doesnt really make a difference. \n\nit's still less work for them as if you gave them empty or [fresh frames](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56e4ca0540261d39b90e4b18/1506479044251-M7L39V6NQP3MLEHXQ1HB/20170915-P9157167.jpg)\n\nthe consistency and the fact that most of the cells are not capped yet tells me the honey in there is probably too high water content for harvest, you *can* harvest it at this stage, but it may go bad relatively quickly, whereas honey with the optimal water content for storage will last literally forever. \n\nbees are cool, this vid is not too bad\n Comment: Kind of like taking a hit from the edge of the bowl so your homie can also get a green hit.\n Comment: > Right in the fucking middle too. \n\nDefinitely wasn't close to the middle lol\n Comment: I'd say that the bees haven't built the caps yet. I don't know about all the methods for uncovering the caps but I've never seen one that leaves the cells qs undestroyed as they are. Plus the cells that are left covered seems to be larvae but it's hard to tell from this angle on a phone.\n Comment: Don't know about that, check the bottom row of cells. They have way too many errors to be artificial\n Comment: \"These honeycombs look fake, they're too perfect.\"\n\nBee: *blushes*\n Comment: Apparently the bees air-dry it.\n\n>They convert the nectar to honey because honey can’t go bad but nectar can. To make the honey they use their wings to make air flow over the stored nectar and dehydrate it. Once it’s at around 18% water content (or a bit less) they cap the honey cells.\n\nhttps://backyardbeekeeping.iamcountryside.com/ask-the-expert/why-is-there-uncapped-honey-in-my-super/\n Comment: Nector is just watery honey\n Comment: In my experience, yes, you can eat it, although when we bottled a bit back when we were starting IIRC it fermented pretty quick, probably due to the excess water content.  Our fully ready honey doesn't really do that, though it does crystalize eventually.\n Comment: It tastes a lot more like sugar water than typical honey, but it’s not a bad taste. \n\nHoney will taste like whatever pollen is collected by bees to make the honey and thus have a richer, more complex taste. \n\nHoney made during different seasons while different plants are blooming and in regions with different biome will have vastly different flavor profiles.\n Comment: Definitely edible and usually tastes great. Its just a little more runny than honey\n Comment: It tastes like watery honey\n Comment: Bee's are one of the few creatures that find and create more food than they could ever use.  They work so dang hard and don't know when to quit!  They very much do \"give a damn\" when a beekeeper messes with their hive.  It is not the honey as much as bees want to defend the queen and the babies (larva).  They will defends their home with their life.  However, There are many things a beekeeper can do to make it not so painful. lol. \n\nBeekeepers have a smoker that they can use to blow smoke in the hive.  It really helps keep the bees from stinging you till you die.  The smoke does 2 things: \n\n1. Blocks their pheromone receptors.  So even if other bees will start spraying alarm pheromones knowing that there is an intruder, the smoke helps keep the other bees from smelling it.   \n2. When bees smell smoke they think \"omg, the forest (and soon our home) is on fire\"  So, knowing they might need to go a long time before their next meal, they pop some (wax) caps and gorge themselves on honey.  This makes them docile like and lazy, like me a few hours after thanksgiving dinner.  \n\nBees natural sworn enemy is the bear.  Because of this bees hate dark colored moving objects, so beekeeper suits are white.  Bees can sense the CO2 from your mouth (thinking its a bear's snout) and want to sting the crap out of your face, so beekeepers wear masks.  Bears make blumbering, bashing, prying attacks on the hive to get the honey, so beekeepers are slow, calm, and make gentle movements.\n Comment: Beekeepers apply smoke to bees to calm them down, if that answers the \"pissed off\" question. As for the honey, I was always under the impression that bees simply make a surplus that we can extract\n Comment: Ackchyually…\n Comment: I'm a beekeeper and this gif is so dumb.  It is either an influencer idiot or new beekeeper idiot.  \nYou can eat nectar, but it goes bad super fast.  \nWhat makes this gif worse is that wax honeycomb takes bees 2x as much energy to make than honey.  Smashing the wax like that is just cruel.\n Comment: Bees are weird. Sometimes they only fill one side. Honestly, I’ve only ever seen a frame full of nectar during our tulip poplar nectar flow; and thst was by accident.\n Comment: Kinda, the pre made wax has the final shape of the comb, like a blueprint, and the bees build on top of that forming the frame you can see in the video\n Comment: If you look at the left edge of the spoon you can see the comb ripping apart from the undisturbed stuff.\n Comment: Not how any of that works. The spoon is destroying the comb, you can see it if you look closely. It maybe being \"synthetic\" is irrelevant. It's still wax that the bees will have to rebuild eitherway.\nAnd it's definitely not honey either. Like the other guy said, it's uncapped. And therefore kind off a dumb thing to do.\n Comment: Do you really think someone would do that? Just go on the Internet and tell lies?\n Comment: You're right, a bad reason is still a reason.\n Comment: Oh really?!\n Comment: He has 1000 gallons?????\n Comment: Thank you I literally never thought of the material and consistency till I saw this vid lol\n Comment: beekeeping isn’t bad for bees.\n Comment: It's a bit waxy, but not in a gross way. Sometimes it has a slight crunch to it as well. Most of the flavor comes from the actual honey though, not the comb. it's really nice.\n Comment: Wax with a hint of honey/flowers.\n Comment: Ayyeee no way!? My first job was in the extractor house as well at 14  lol small world! You know what's up than, it's like liquid gold, I miss it.\n Comment: Ah that all makes sense, thank you for the info!\nWhat do you mean it’s too much for one-time-use? It looks like the spoon is barely bigger than their thumb, so it’s just like a spoonful; not too much to be like a mouthful or in a tea or on yogurt or w/e?\n Comment: I learn something new every day on Reddit.

Nope, sugar water.\n\n\"Yo this is bunk, who took my shit!?\"\n Comment: I used to be a bee keeper and we did feed them plenty of corn syrup to get them through the winter, but there's more to it than just taking too much from them.  \nAt least in Canadian winters it was better for us to take the honey away and give the corn syrup at times, because our bees would often collect canola honey, which gets very hard over time (especially in winter) and can be too difficult for the bees to extract in winter.  \nBut we would also keep a bunch of honey over winter (boxes we would pull during the honey flow and not extract), so that at around this time of year/early March we would go check on the hives to make sure they had food reserves.  If they were out of honey we would give them a frame or two so that they could survive until early spring flowers.  \nMany bee keepers just give the sugar water solution at this time, but we found if a hive is too weak they can't collect it properly and starve out anyways.  But by putting a frame of honey next to the cluster of bees they would often be able to extract it and live.\n Comment: Thanks for the reply\n Comment: Actually in real life most bee keepers don't leave any honey to the bees. They take it all and replace it with water and sugar.\n Comment: So after running through the centrifuge, you can just give the comb back to the hive and they’ll reuse it?\n\nWhat if it’s a comb from another hive, do they care?\n Comment: Can i ask why would they swarm more if they have more honey?

You can see the trashed comb behind where the spoon is as he drags it.\n Comment: That's literally what it is, the bees form a little relationship with their keeper, in exchange for having a mountain sized invincible behemoth (atleast that's what we are to them) who protects them and gived them anything they need, they have to give him a bit of honey every once in a while.\n Comment: To bee >!I will not apologize!< fair, this is more like somebody knocking out the shelves in your pantry while taking all your canned soup. They can just glue the shelves back together.\n Comment: COME AND TAKE OUR STINGERS FROM OUR COLD DEA- hey wait a minute guys\n Comment: Right oop my alley\n Comment: Be better.\n Comment: I thought so too. Then I looked closer and I was wrong.\n\nYou can see the trashed comb behind where the spoon is as he drags it.\n Comment: Went to visit a apiary/distillery in January, and during the tour the owner showed us that when they harvest honey from the tray, they only slice a few milometers of the honeycomb, which is enough to slice away the \"plugs\" while leaving the honeycomb structure intact. That way, the colony can re-use the same honeycomb without having to rebuild/rework it first.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: # \"Wax on, wax pissed off\"\n\n\\- 🧽 🐝 🥋\n Comment: That remind me in a party some dudes start trying to do that with a honeycomb they found in nature it fall i ended with at least 5 bee stings because all the bees start attacking the people at the party\n Comment: Bees don't particularly care because they repair things on equal opportunity.  Unlike humans, they do not distinguish whether communities are at the margin, underfunded, ignored, or completely disregarded.  So edges, centers, somewhere in between... it doesn't matter.  They will repair with the same vigor regardless of the location.\n Comment: They used to have to destroy the entire hive to get honey.\n Comment: Bro why is this so hilarious to me 😂 bees are amazing\n Comment: Scoop scoop pass\n Comment: Took two seconds to look into it. The dark looking honey is called Brood Comb and it hosts the larve. Imagine the capped ones that are visible are likely where larvae are currently cocooned and developing into bees (just looked it up says the larvae actually make silk cocoons after they've been capped so cool) \n\nRemoving caps for home usually involves cutting a thin layer off the comb with a knife or some sharp blade. This one I know from my family's bee keeping.\n Comment: Also, look at the leading edge of the spoon. It's gathering material. If this was silicon or something they wouldn't be breaking off and traveling with the spoon.\n Comment: I think bee facts have blown my mind more times than any other subject. How do they sense the water content??\n Comment: This is the most interesting thing I’ve seen all week.\n Comment: 1. It’s more like taking from the big sisters.\n\n2. It’s less stealing and more collecting rent.\n Comment: Both humans and bees freeze dry and seal their food to prolong it. Amazing.\n Comment: That’s it. Honey is just Nectar Jerky.\n Comment: /subscribe to daily bee facts\n Comment: And a little bee spit\n Comment: fermented like mead or fermented like grodiness?\n Comment: A girlfriend of mine has two hives inside a massive, two house plot-sized English garden. \n\nThe honey from her bees literally tastes like magic. You can taste dandelion and roses, lilies and even pines, her cut comb costs about 15$ for a square twice as big as a deck of cards and I HOARDE that shit all winter. It can cure SAD I fucking swear you can even taste grass.\n Comment: Oh that's really interesting - I learnt a few new things today! Thanks for taking the time to write this out!\n Comment: You don't always need smoke though, I've watched many videos with bees being totally fine with the keeper removing a comb with zero smoke used, and they say it's better for the bees to not smoke them.\n Comment: That's what I was wondering. What happens to all this honey, if it's not taken away by a beekeeper? Why do they produce so much, or is this more of an unnatural phenomenon not happening \"in the wild\"?\n Comment: You don't always have to smoke bees. They're truly super docile if you move calmly with purpose and don't make any loud bang or noises they stay calm and busy. Unless they are africanized or a rough hybrid, bees usually don't directly attack. Also don't wear black or brown. When you get stung you are also being marked by the bee that stung you it says \"look out danger\" and more bees will come to sting you.  Bees make honey until they run out of space then the hive could swarm without enough room. Beekeepers add room (supers they are usually called) to keep the bees producing honey. They will also add a queen separator to make sure there is no brood in the honey and keep the queen in the lower deep super. I've been keeping bees on and off for 20 years. I love them and it's worth keeping them. I don't need to use smoke with my current hives and I only wear a veil because getting stung in the face is the worst.\n Comment: I used to keep bees (until learning I'm allergic to their stings) and agree that this is dumb and a waste of good honeycomb and nectar.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Yeah no problem! Bees are cool little fuckers, and so are their hives.\n Comment: Ah yes that was actually my mistake. After I replied to you I realized it wasn’t all that much. I’ve just seen a lot of honey harvesting posts where they destroy an entire uncapped honeycomb assuming it’s ready when it’s not. \n\nBut in this case it looks like they were just showing off how it looks. It does look better without caps to scrape the honey off when it doesn’t have caps (even though caps are edible). So that’s probably why they posted it that way. The caps I’m taking about is bees wax, and it helps give the honey the necessary environment for eliminating contaminants. The bees will replace what has been destroyed to the best of their ability if they have time. \n\nRegardless, it ferments quickly so you’ve got to eat it straight away. The flavor and texture will also be different, because the nectar hasn’t gone through the entire transformation process.\n\nI quickly searched for something that explains more, hopefully this helps: \n\nhttps://busybeekeeping.com/can-you-eat-uncapped-honey/\n Comment: Sorry I just noticed your comment. I’m happy to reply as I’m an amateur bee nerd, but there may be others who know more. \n\nWhat I know about what happens to bees when they sting is that they can’t retract their stinger. When they sting, the venom pumps through the stinger and into what they are attacking. After that, it’s like an amputation and it kills them. So the reason they only sting once is because their stinger gets trapped or falls off and they die afterwards.\n\nYou might have heard the phrase “hive mind” before. It’s exactly like what it sounds and named after how bees behave. They work as one unit, with their ultimate goal being gathering nectar, pollinating, and defending the queen and hive. So they’re like soldiers. \n\nSo as far as aggression overall goes, honeybees are generally non-violent unless they feel threatened and that’s why they sting. If it feels threatened, it’s sting also releases a hormone to warn the hive of the threat. They’ll otherwise have no necessary reason to attack out of nowhere.\n\nSide interesting fact is that only females sting. They’re infertile worker bees that do all of the work with defense and making honey. So if you were ever stung by a bee, it’s a fact that it was female. Also all honey you’ve eaten was created by female honeybees.\n\nMales have an unflattering title of “drone.” Their only responsibility is to fertilize the queen (only fertile bee in the hive) should she so desire. She releases hormones to the males in order to signal when she is ready and willing. Males aren’t capable of stinging. \n\nQueen bees only attack other queens when fighting over dominance of a hive. So if you see a honeybee and freak out and swap at it, it’s unnecessary. If you leave it alone its unlikely to harm you, even if it lands on you. \n\nWasps and bumblebees are very different. They can sting more than once and for other reasons. With honeybees, they are essentially entirely driven by hormones and are a fascinating creature that communicates in hormonal codes in ways that other species do not.\n Comment: SAMIR... WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN\n Comment: For the uninitiated: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9-voINFkCg\n Comment: HONEY, YOU DROPPED YOUR COMB.\n Comment: BEESA**\n Comment: Golden comment, right here.\n Comment: It's more like: ^^\"Shaddup\"\n Comment: Mmmmmmm internet coins are the only sustenance I need, oh random internet friend\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: The numbers just don't add up\n Comment: I dunno, maybe they appreciate the change of pace after eating honey all year.\n\n\"DAMN, is this straight sugar water? MMMM, that's good shit!\"\n Comment: To a bee sugar water is basically identical to nectar. They’d probably be like, “Fresh ingredients? Awesome! We don’t have to spend the rest of the winter suckling on this old ass honey”\n Comment: haha it's like kids replacing their da's liquor with water\n Comment: Egger yer skin's hangin off\n Comment: Hi! I've always wanted to talk to a beekeeper about bees! I find bees extremely fascinating. Can i ask you the most random question i have? \n\nIf you're eating honeycomb, is there ALWAYS a chance there's eggs or larvae in it? Is there any \"don't lay your babies here\" area of the hive? Or is it all one big operation, everyone's his doing the same?\n Comment: Yes, they'll refill the comb and cap them shut. I doubt they'd mind which hive it came from but don't know for a fact.\n Comment: Bees swarm when the hive they occupy is too crowded. About half of them all get together, get fairly aggressive and go off to try to found a new hive. If a hive is too full of cells capped for honey, they will recognize the current hive doesn't have enough room for them to make more honey or to lay brood and thus may be more likely to swarm.\n Comment: I use foundation-less frames for all my hives because I don’t like the idea of plastics coming into contact with my food. Also pesticides tend to build up in the plastic foundation over time. I know most of the beekeepers in my association have switched away from foundation for this reason.\n Comment: Oh how cool! A lil starter honeycomb.\n Comment: At least beekeepers acknowledge bees have needs and meets them. I want to be a bee, it seems fun.\n Comment: Lmao i have nothing against beekeeping but that's slavery with extra steps.\n Comment: Pull out game catching mad hang time\n Comment: 🐝 better\n Comment: Mhm, they can take out the whole frame (essentially slices of comb as seen in the video), uncap it by running a flat knife along it, and then spin it out in a drum to get it all out. Then you can just put them back!\n Comment: It IS a good advertisement for honey, though.\n Comment: You got most of it right. Only thing is that it's not darker honey in the middle it's the wax that has gotten darker from hatching more larvae then the other more lightly colored cells. Also if you use a knife to uncover you will still gett jagged edges on the cells, some leftover wax in the cells and won't leave any random cells covered as in the clip. \n\nSource: I am an amateur bee keeper\n Comment: Judging by the rest of the comb and how free flowing this honey was, this honey wasn't even ready yet.  Bees don't cap honey until the majority of water has evaporated.  That's what's even more infuriating about this video, they destroyed the comb cells to make a video for ~~watered down honey~~ sugar water.\n Comment: I don’t know but to also blow your mind; bees have sense of time!\n Comment: They taste it and know that its not ready yet.\n Comment: How do they make perfect hexagons without any measuring tools?\n Comment: [You will appreciate this then.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplodiploidy)Their cooperation and altruism evolved because of how interrelated the members of the hive are. While, unless we have an identical twin or are the product of in-breeding, are max related to another person by 50% because we have two copies of every chromosome, one from each parent. Those two chromosomes are a mixture of the two chromosomes our parents got from our grandparents. Bees, and hymenopterans in general, are more complex. The females have two copies of each chromosome, but the males have only one since they are the product of asexual reproduction—that is all unfertilized eggs actually hatch and are all male. While female bees have a father and a mother, male bees only a mother. That means there’s only three sets of chromosomes to blend together when making females and as a result they are related to each other by 75%. So, if most of the females spend their time working to make sure the queen can reproduce while not reproducing themselves, that’s ok because they’ll still have a large share of their genes passed down by their sister. \n\nI love bees and ants.\n Comment: But rent is basically stealing from the poor.\n Comment: So stealing\n Comment: Ehhhh… I’ve had actual mead once, and I don’t think it was that.  So maybe grodiness.\n Comment: I have hives around my garden and the honey tastes like candied apricots. It's absolutely divine.\n Comment: I'm guessing its a combination of things like not having to worry about predators or scarcity. Not as much pollen in the winter months so you stock up, except beekeepers give them sugar water or pollen when the flowers aren't in bloom and keep away predators. The bees still get ready though, just in case.\n\nIf they stuff the hive so much there's no room for brood the colony can actually split, sending off a queen and a ball of bees to find a new place.\n Comment: Uneducated guess : Honey can last decades without going bad as long as it's sealed,  so maybe they have the instinct to cache as much of it as they can. Better too much than too little and all that.\n Comment: include gaping profit dinosaurs unite tap voiceless paint ludicrous outgoing\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n Comment: Wild! At one time I saw a guy who has a crop pollination business (takes bees to almond fields etc) giving away 50 gallon drums of honey because he had so much lol.\n Comment: Ah super interesting, thank you!!\n\nAnd no worries, i had to look at it a bunch of times before figuring out how big the spoon was (first glance - huge spoon, 5th glance - ~2 tablespoons, 7th glance - oh that’s actually p small!). I feel like the style and maybe the camera angle makes it look bigger\n Comment: There's more than one queen in a hive?

The only food that doesn't rot or \" go bad\" old or not honey is delicious.\n Comment: SUGAR.....in.....WATER!\n Comment: Only the queen will lay eggs and she mostly goes where she wants.  \nBut often you will run a queen excluder which has small slits in it that she can't fit through but normal bees can.  So she will lay in the bottom of the hive while the workers store the honey in the higher boxes.  \nBut when you look at the honey comb you can see if it has larva or honey or pollen in it.  They all look very different.\n Comment: Amateur bee keeper here ✋\n\nBees aren’t picky about the comb being built specifically by their hive- in fact many hives come with artificial comb. \n\nIt’s best however to uncap the honey and use a centrifuge to remove the honey and leave the comb intact. Bees use precious time, energy, and resources to build comb that could otherwise be used for building up their honey stores. \n\nIf a really rough winter wipes your hive out and you have to purchase a new package of bees, they will settle in just fine in the hive with the old hive’s comb.\n Comment: Though sharing comb is a good way to spread disease if done regularly.\n Comment: Isn't the foundation commonly made of wax, not plastic?\n Comment: Slavery involves them being forced to live in beekeeper hives. If they want to leave and make their own, they can. If the beekeeper is bad at beekeeping, they do. \n\nBees stay with beekeepers because the honey tax imposed upon them is worth the protection from predation, disasters, and disease beekeepers provide.\n Comment: Government, with tax collection and military?\n Comment: The bees are free to leave at any time. They stay because it's the best option for them.\n Comment: I mean they can literally leave whenever they want and the keeper would be unable to stop them. Why should they tho when they have it all figured out\n Comment: More like an offering to a god.\n Comment: How though? They are permanently protected by the most powerful beings on earth, get free healthcare, amazing insurance, an infinite source of food, amazing conditions, all for like 25% of their harvest\n Comment: I tried. xD\n Comment: Tom Lum's explanation on how we found that out is absolutely amazing https://youtu.be/xlGuBT5GT10\n Comment: Thank you for subscribing to Bee Facts!

Bubbles in a drink also seem to make perfect hexagons.\n Comment: They call cousin Randy, he could eyeball a teaspoon through a fork I tell ya hwat\n Comment: https://youtu.be/QFj-hF8XDQ0\n Comment: Practice\n Comment: They use their body as a guide, and all the bees are the same size with the exact same behavior. So they all make the same sized cell.\n Comment: No basically about it\n Comment: It really depends on how many you want and what kind of effort you want to put into it. Our bees are caught swarms not bought so that's much cheaper than 2-300 a hive package. Are you going to build or buy your supers and frames...depending on that is the difference in a few 100. Time is about 2 hours a week except for harvest season which is a bit more depending on how many hives. Fall and spring mite treatment is a few extra hours on the average. Then you have splits and health checks which is the average 2hrs a week(depending on how many you have). Winter time you have 1 to 1 sugar water making or fondant making with wintergreen mint to cut the possibility of trachea mites in spring. \n\nTo start is alot especially on the money side. I think we figured our initial set up for the bees we have now at a little over 500 and we built everything ourselves without kits. I recommend checking out barnyard bees on YouTube. He's got a lot of good advice and great time break downs. Bees are a commitment, if you fear them at all or don't want bees in your buisness after a rain or on a pollen filled day I don't recommend it. Bees just like chickens have a multiple math to them. Each year you will get more or somehow end up with too many swarms. We try to keep it at 3 hives but have been upto 15 and as low as 1. Also always start with 2 because it is more than likely you will lose one by fall.\n\nEdit also find some information before you plunge in. Many people don't know what they are getting into with bees until they have 2 hives in their car or truck. My husband loved beekeeping for dummies. It's explained pretty simply\n Comment: # \"Really guy?... unfucking beelievable\"\n\n\\-  🐝\n Comment: Left! Left!!! LEFT!!!\n Comment: Happy cake day to you!\n Comment: Shxih qoqiebl, yeobvctd!

That comparison would be apt if you were eating steak every day and all of a sudden were offered dog food and you just decide to chow down on those sweet meaty biscuits.\n Comment: Do you add the milk to the steak before or after you cook it?\n Comment: See I’ve only ever had Labradors, the idea of a dog not going near their own food is a completely foreign concept to me. \n\nGenerally speaking it’s lucky if it actually hits the bottom of the bowl.\n\nWonderful dogs but you do need to keep a tight lease on their diet.\n Comment: I cook my dog some food every time I'm cooking mine. And so if I ever eat out and leave him dry food, he won't touch it. \n\nSo I've started saving him some food in the freezer for these occasions. He's very spoiled. But he's a good boy and he deserves the best food.\n Comment: I CAN KEEP STINGING!\n Comment: it doesn’t go bad because its mostly sugar, which sucks all the water out of microbes and kills them\n Comment: It can definitely get a little weird when it's old, even if it's not crystallized up and fermented, but it's still safe to eat.\n Comment: Maybe. I know several people who make fruit preserves. Their preserves are both delicious and last a long time. But nothing compares to the taste of fresh fruit.\n Comment: > they will settle in just fine in the hive with the old hive’s comb.\n\n\"Fancy that! Someone came along and built all these little chambers, just the right size and shape that we need them in!\"\n\nSo for bees, this is more like moving into an apartment complex, and less like moving into a haunted house.\n Comment: Usually plastic with a light layer of wax “painted” on. Not always but usually. Wax is fragile and transporting it would be difficult.\n Comment: *knock knock*\n\n“It’s the BRS, we need honey”\n Comment: Sorry sir but that's actually wrong. They can't leave because the queen is usually trapped in a very small plastic container Inside the hive, and bees will always follow the queen. And yea we basically  enslave them but we need food and it Is what is it.\n Comment: And because bee keepers usually clip the queen's wings to prevent them from leaving.\n Comment: Tbf, the govt usually don't throw smoke bombs into your house to sedate you while they run in and break the walls down for that sweet sweet cash.\n\n* *Usually*.

Just looked it up, looks like it's 3.9. Yeah, that's very acidic!\n Comment: Can I fill a bathtub with honey and get in it and let it suck all the water out of me?\n Comment: Just an FYI for anyone who doesn't already know, If it crystalises you can just warm it (gently, i.e. in a bath of warm water rather than a pan or microwave) to return it to its formerly clear state. See [here](https://justbeehoney.co.uk/blogs/just-bee-honey-blog/why-does-honey-crystallize) for details.\n Comment: I love the crystallized, I use it like a spread; it’s the best!\n Comment: While true, you would traditionally have preserves during times when fruit wasn't available. Between nothing and sweet fruit jams, I take the jam every time.\n Comment: Oh absolutely. Although I would liken it more to a penthouse. Hives kept by humans generally have what is called a Queen Excluder. The Queen and her attendants occupy the lower boxes called Deeps and fill the cells with brood, eggs, etc. \n\nThe excluder has holes that are much too tiny for the Queen to fit through, ensuring the honey in the top deeps are free from eggs and larvae. When these frames are removed, you can be rest assured there are no baby bee parts in your honey. \n\nAs always, the top floor is a little more exclusive. Thus- penthouse.\n Comment: They are even paying rent\n Comment: I only ever bought wax foundations and never had a big issue with them breaking. Sure a few broke but most could be salvaged and used. Using plastic just seemed wrong to me but I was a hobbyist and not a commercial beekeeper\n Comment: It's the *H*RS, the Hive Revenue Service!\n Comment: I thought the queen is free to roam just isnt allowed to go to the upper frames to keep the brood in lower frames where its safer. \n\nIf shes in a plastic box she cant really lay eggs properly, no?\n Comment: That's not a really good idea tho.. Usually we just place her in a plastic container Inside the beehive.\n Comment: Have you heard of these things called cops?\n Comment: They would if you didn't pay taxes\n Comment: Empirical evidence says otherwise.\n Comment: Not unless you're black\n Comment: Thanks for the recommendation!\n Comment: Its slightly entertaining how close her name is to Carolina reaper\n Comment: Thank you for upgrading to Bee Facts Premium! Your card will be charged $9.99 monthly. \n\nThe queen bee lives for about 2-3 years.

I believe I've read about that before.\n\nWhat else would cause a swarm to abandon a hive? Disease?\n Comment: Is this plastic container constructed in a way that prevents the queen from easily leaving?\n Comment: Is there a platinum version\n Comment: [Indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY)!\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: The pH Scale ranges from 0 to 14, 0-1 being the strongest acid, and 13-14 the strongest base, with water basically being mostly neutral at 7, so yeah, it's acidic, by that scale.  Also, it's logarithmic I think.\n Comment: Well hopefully I’ll be a dead ass mummy for whomever eventually finds me.\n Comment: Disease or pests(most often Varroa Mites or Wax Moths) can cause a hive to swarm, but likely it’ll will take the hive out before the hive actually swarms and leaves. \n\nSometimes the reason for a swarm is tough to pin down but in my experience bees will most often swarm when they run out of space to expand their hive. It’s important that beekeepers do frequent hove inspections and add boxes accordingly as their hives grow so bees have room to expand their stores.\n Comment: Yes, is a very small cilinder with holes, and they are pretty cheap.",

        "title": "I've heard from some people \"beekeeping is expensive\"",
        "text": "is this true? What about it is expensive if it is?\n Comment: I’m a new beekeeper as of this year and have been tracking my spending closely. \n\nI started with 2 purchased packages of bees and have since done a split and caught a swarm. I’m 4 hives in with all the tools, a nuc, a bunch of in use equipment, some extra equipment, and overall have spent $1089.64\n\nI should also add, I have gotten a lot of equipment for free as well. I’d estimate I received another $1000 worth of hive boxes, frames, and foundations completely free from my mentor. \n\nIt’s expensive to get going. And when they’re doing well, they surprise you with more costs! Suddenly you need another deep box with frames and foundations.\n Comment: This is just me but I built a top bar hive out of scrap wood and caught a swarm last summer.\nThe only thing I've spent money on is my clothing and tools which weren't alot.\nI've just harvested my first bit of honey 👌\n Comment: The traditional methods of entry to this hobby are expensive.  If cost is a barrier there are cost cutting measures that you can take.  Beekeeping is a rewarding hobby so if you are interested it is worth it.\n\n* If you have some skills and tools you can make your own hives.  If you have access to scrap lumber you can make hive parts for even less.  We have posters on this sub who have made it all for free. If you buy the supplies, bee boxes will cost about $6 to $11 each to make depending on where you buy your lumber.  A bottom board will cost about $15 to make, and a hive top about $20 to make.  \n\n* You can get bees by catching a swarm.  There are no guarantees that you will catch bees this year.  If you don't catch a swarm then a nuc colony will run you $160 to $200, depending on where you are.\n\n* You don't need a bee suit.  A jacket and veil and heavy denim jeans is sufficient.  Be advised, stings make the hobby un-fun, so a good jacket and veil is worth it.  You're looking at an unavoidable $70 expense.  \n\n* You can save money on purchasing foundation by going foundationless.  Foundation will run you about $75 for a starter hive.  \n\n* Frames are hard to make and inexpensive to buy but if that is a barrier then frames are small parts that can be made from scraps for free.  Langstroth hive frames are $1.60 each to purchase.  You're looking at an unavoidable $50 expense if you buy frames.  I don't recommend trying to make frames, even if you have plans, without first purchasing frames to have as an example.  So even if you make frames, you're looking at that first box, $16.00\n\n* You don't have to use a frame hive.  Top bar hives don't use frames. \n\n* A Kenyan Top Bar hive is designed to be inexpensive and easy to make and easy to operate.  It is a foundationless hive.  If you have the skills to make one from scrap wood, its a free hive.  If you buy the lumber its about $125 to make.  Its $350 to $400 to buy one.\n\n* A Warré hive uses top bars but it can also use frames.  If you are in the USA then 42 states require movable comb and Warré comb won't be movable without at least a half frame. A Warré is a foundationless hive so it has almost no cost to operate. \n\n* A Warré hive (r/warre)  is inexpensive and easy to make.  Warré hives were  designed to be a peoples hive, cheap to make and cheap to operate.  But online Warré sellers think they have a boutique product  so if you buy one online they are really expensive.  I made my first Warré for $6 for a complete hive.  I recycled a water bed frame to make it; $6 was the cost of the rattle can spray I used to finish it.  You can make Warré boxes from a 2x10.  If movable comb is required in your state you will need at least a table saw to make the half frames or full frames.  If you have to buy Warré frames they are expensive as hell, you'll pay $240 for frames just to get started. \n\n* One of the under $20 dollar smokers on Amazon will last you five years until the bellows break if you take care of it.  If you stay with the hobby you will eventually need to replace it with a better smoker, but they are a good starter.  \n\n* You need a hive tool.  It's an unavoidable $10.  Don't try and do it with a putty knife.\n\n* You do not need an extractor.   You can use crush and strain to harvest.  \n\n* Because bees are so expensive learning how to manage varroa mites is a must if you are on a shoestring budget and you can't afford to start over.  Treating for mites with oxalic acid is 5¢, but the vaporizer can run you $150 to over $500.  If you do an oxalic acid dribble you can use a $20 scale and a $5 bottle, but a dribble can only be used once per year. Treatments such as Apivar and Formic Pro run about $25 per application.  You'll treat two to three times a year.  This isn't optional if you want to keep healthy bees.  You'll probably read online about chemical free mite management methods.  Those methods are beyond the skills of a new beekeeper.  The beekeepers that are doing it have decades of experience and large enough apiaries to absorb losses.  If that's our goal then you can work towards it, but you will not be successful as a beginner.  If you are beekeeping on a shoestring it is a lesson you cannot afford to learn the hard way.\n Comment: I've been pretty cheap, but it takes a lot of extra work, time, energy, luck, and connections. \nI got a free nuc from a friend. \nBaited and trapped a swarm within a week.\nBuilt all of my hive boxes out of free/scrap/donated wood.\nHad my own tools. \nSo I've bought paint, screws, a tool kit for $50 on Amazon (cowl, gloves, smoker, etc), a separate hive tool on Amazon for $17, and put in SO MUCH TIME building everything.. so far I've spent under $300 and I'll have 2 hives by next weekend.\nBut, it has taken so much extra time and energy, it's like I'm working a second job without the pay.\n Comment: Figure $750 per full hive.  Bees $200 per hive. Bees die another $200 per hive. Tools, suit, extractor $400 (easy). Not cheap.  Buying honey at $7 per jar is cheaper.\n Comment: I have about $450 invested in my first hive,\n\nFlow hive on offer up $100\n\nJacket w/ gloves amazon $40\n\nTool kit w/smoker amazon $40\n\nSecond deep brood box ebay $50\n\n2 gallon top box feeder ebay $30\n\n4 frame nuc $150\n\nPackage of apivar $45\n\nNot including the metric shit ton of sugar ive feed them thus far\n Comment: Its true. It’s an expensive hobby. My first year, I spent well over 2k in supplies just to get started. Then more as I expanded. I’ve not come close to even breaking even selling honey or wax…yet. Maybe one day, but probably not lol.\n Comment: I tell those that want to get into beekeeping to expect to spend ~$1000 the first year to set up at least 2 hives and buy necessary supplies and equipment.\n\nIf that sounds expensive ask yourself how much you would spend on some other hobby such as boating or motorcycles.\n Comment: I am in the third year. Invested 1k so far. This spring is my first harvest. My honey frames are full. Probably 60-80kg honey. I sell it in 250g glasses for 5€ to locals. So 250 - 300 glasses. If everything is sold I have my investment back. And can reinvest in more nucs and hardware. I don't want to make money. It's for the bees and a nice hobby.\n Comment: Plus treatment costs. \nMost hobbies have a cost and this is one I am ready to shell out for\n Comment: Yes. Definitely have spent at least $2K on supplies, treatments, nucs, electric fence...it's always something!\n Comment: I've currently got 14 hives. I've spent ~$14k on woodenware. But my wood is enough for when I double to around 30 hives.\n Comment: It sure can bee. I have built all but the first hive from free scrap wood (20-8 frame hives in total, including all the frames). I have spent $500 plus on top feeders and waxed / un-waxed foundations. I caught a swarm last August, and they made it through winter (luck)! Took that swarm and made walkway splits now have five hives full of bees. Now, I'm getting into queen, rearing a few more $ for supplies. Sugar is $15 for a 25-pound bag, and the 5 hives can go through that in a week. It all ads up, and I'm not planning to harvest any honey until fall 2024.\n Comment: Yes it’s expensive and not guaranteed to pay out\n Comment: My bees refuse to wear Target brand clothes so I’ve had to buy 40,000 pairs of Good American jeans. :( it adds up. \n\nKidding, but in my first year I’ve purchased two suits, the initial brood box (gifted), then a super, another brood box, different handling equipment, smoker, etc. it’s been several hundred. I split it up over the course of several months, after I made the decision to make the leap. But I had to be intentional about setting money aside to buy their supplies so I’d be prepared once they got here, and then still had a few purchases that I didn’t think I’d need in the first couple months.\n Comment: Yup.\n Comment: Well here’s what you do. Don’t make honey, make bees. I got my first hive and made 4 more hives out of it. The next year I split some of those hives. Unless you’re hive is filling 2 supers don’t take their honey. And even then just take like half of one super. They are literally making their winter food supply. When you take all their honey and feed them pollen pattie’s and other crap over the winter no wonder they die.\n Comment: Tools and starter set (Deep, 10 frames, covers and baseboard) $149\n\nHive kit (1 deep, 4 medium, baseboard, covers) $114\n\nOil to weatherproof the wood $20\n\nFrames (full plastic, heavily waxed, 10 deep, 20 medium) ~$100\n\nPackage bees $149\n Comment: You can certainly cut corners if you are handy, and able to make your own equipment. But even then, you will need to buy foundation for frames, your gear, tools, bees, bee feeders, etc. If you plan on harvesting honey from your hives, that is another few hundred dollars in expenses as well.\n\nMy first year I had 1 hive, and did not harvest any honey and I spent just under $1000\n Comment: I’m about $1400 in. That’s for 2 hives with 4 medium boxes each.   All the tools, 2 bee suits, 2 packages of bees and a queen bee for $50 when my first queen escaped on install\n Comment: Can be true but isn’t necessary to spend a lot. I made my own swarm traps (free bees). Made my hives for $50-$75 each. Made all my own frames. Did crush and strain method when harvesting the first couple years so there was no extractor expense until the bees paid for it. \n\nCan’t recall what I spent on suit, smoker, hive tool but I’m thinking it was around $100-$150 for all three.\n Comment: I started this year and did 3 hives. I purchased my hives on sale at a local scratch and dent store, so this saved me a bit! Here is my breakdown so far\n\n3 x $100 on sale 2 deep 1 super 8 frame set\n3 x $145 for 3 lb bee package\n3 x $17 8 frame top feeder\n2 x $12 1 lb bees wax (for painting the plastic frames)\n1 x $125 vented bee suit\n1 x $20 bee smoker\n1 x $10 hive tool\n1 x $6 marking pen\n1 × $10 queen clips\n1 x $6 bee brush\n1 x $55 wood and screws for hive stand and crushed rock\n1 x $57 10 pack for formic pro mite treatment \nTotal $1099.00\n\nThis was a bare minimum. I have also purchased a\n$14 bee club membership \n$12 bee calander from my local bee club\n$10 apairy state registration \nAnd I did not take a bee class, but I wish I had! Just to have that experience and, more importantly, a mentor I could call. That could be avoided by joining a bee club months before getting bees and getting local connections , but it was a last-minute decision for me this year.\n\nSo my hives on sale helped me keep my cost down, and 3 help me lower my cost per hive, but I will probably need more supers and do not forget to wax plastic foundations!!!!! That mistake cost me another $75 when I had to pay a local beekeeping store to come out and help figure out why all of my hives were making a big mess. Also, climate depend for you, but here in Maine, I need to wrap my hives and have no clue about cost. \n\nLastly, I have no wax melting stuff or honey harvesting tools or supplies yet because I am banking on not needing them this year.\n Comment: 10yrs in and I make more selling honey than my expenses, but I tend to put the extra $ back into the hobby. Upgrade to the extractor, better uncaper, and the like. It’s a hobby and I enjoy it as such. My spouse travels a couple times a year to run marathons… my hobby is less expensive than theirs :). Expensive, yes it can be. But bees are fascinating, and I really enjoy building the gear to support the hobby… self-built extractor, automatic mite wash swirl table, printable mite-wash tools, and plenty on the to-do list. It’s a hobby and done because I enjoy it.\n Comment: Expenses are just one part of it.  It also takes:\n\nMore storage space than you can imagine.  \n\nPremium time.   You don’t inspect bees in bad weather or fit them in after work.  It’s mid day inspections on days you’d rather be with family, fishing, at the beach, etc\n\nMore time.  Assembling boxes, painting.  Driving to suppliers to pick up packages, NUCs, replacement queens, selling honey.   Driving to out yards.  \n\nRealizing Varroa wasn’t as bad as it’s made out to be.  It’s worse.  \n\nContinuing education.   Steep learning curve.   \n\nThe big lie:  “sure you can do it with one or two hives”.   Yes and you’ll burn out on that after two years of failure.  It’s agricultural and prone to failure.  You need to run a handful of colonies to use them to support each other \n\nEvery comment is dead on about money.   I did everything I could to save money.   Just two years in I’d exceed $2,500.    I stopped claims to my wife that her large garden was as expensive. \n\nI love the hobby but there is no way I could have done it years ago with a young family and a demanding job.\n Comment: I could trade my bees for a boat and save lots of money! \n\nIt would probably take you about $600 to $800 to set up two hives, bees, and equipment. Then there's other stuff. Pest treatments, supplements for feeding, extra woodware and frames, odd tools, and accessories.  Then let's talk about extracting equipment!  After you buy the stuff to start out with, it mostly comes in dribs and drabs, and never when you expected it. \n\nAlso, take into account how far the nearest bee supply is.\n Comment: It is as expensive as you want it to be. If you have the desire and know how, you can become a bee keeper for the cost of some scrap wood and your time. \nIf you have the money to spend, you can go and buy a fancy Flow hive and a nuk and everything else, and spend $800-$1500.  \nIt is a hobby where you can spend what you want depending on the level of convenience you desire. \n\nFree or $thousands, he only ‘wrong’ way is to not do your research and take care of the bees and by extension, other bee colonies around you.\n Comment: I started with one hive with 2 deep and 2 supers and a nuc for roughly 450 usd 190 for nuc and about 250 for the hive\nAnd I got a cheap kit on Amazon for about 70 that came with just about everything I needed except a suit. a cheap one is probably like 40 usd but I recommend getting a better one or at least a good  jacket \nAlso, I don't mess with the leather gloves often. Get some decent boxed rubber gloves it's cheaper, and it is, in my opinion, easier to work the hive.\n Comment: Bee keeping is as cheap or as expensive as you make it. You can build a hive, if you have the tools, for well under $100, or you can buy a \"premium\" option like a flow hive for just over $1,000. Really the most expensive part are the bees alone if you do not catch a swarm. They are going to be minimum $150 USD for just a package. You can get started for well under $500 and build from there.\n Comment: I purchased a nuc for $265, there were swarms cells in it (to my excitement and surprise) so I split right away. For a suit, tools, boxes, tops, bottoms, frames, food and treatment…. I was in well over $1000 and that’s Canadian.\n Comment: When you can burn $100 and laugh, you're a beekeeper.\n Comment: Most of the expense is getting started. I wouldn't consider it very expensive. After that it's mostly little additions but it also depends on how many hives you want to have.\n Comment: 150€ for 3  langstroh and 1 super with frames + 1 colony + 2 anarchic colonies i had to get straight. 90€ for a full suit, 15€ smoker, 5€ hive tool. I then bought another langstroh broodbox + super + frames for 50€ and an electric thingy to heat the wires to get foundation on for 10€. Around 20€ worth of wax foundation.\n\nAll the broodboxes had frame feeders. I replaced them since by top feeders for 10€/ unit so 40€. \n\n1 apivar pack for 23€ last August. \n\nSome sugar to make sirup, about 20€/year. \n\n1 decantation bucket + sieve, 15€. \n\nSo far, about 430€ for 4 colonies in good health with good Gear. I'll have to buy 2 more supers next year, and an extractor, so i'd say around 700€ total to be totally equipped with 4 production hives\n Comment: I have always done beekeeping g commercially, but Idk aht they're talking about being expensive, you can get up and running for a few hundred pounds here in the UK. By the way, it's a hobby that yields valuable honey in return so in theory it should be a net positive. \n\nThere's also an enormous amount of unused material from previous beekeepers that can be gotten for free or almost free\n Comment: Insurance costs me about $450 per year. I would recommend anyone keeping bees get insurance unless you literally live in the middle of nowhere and nobody eats your honey but you. Find out if where you live requires a business license or other rule following before you can sell honey (mine does, hilariously it’s the same rules for people selling baked goods out of their kitchen).\n Comment: Cheaper than a dog or cat. They don't give honey.\n Comment: Once you get past year 3 you start to recoup quickly. First couple of years will cost 2-3 grand. But in year 3 you'll probably earn maybe 2k. I look to earn 500-750 per hive per year. If they don't earn that, it's a shake down and new bees next year from a good colony. It's brutal but the only way if you want to make a business out of it. Given my time again, I'd have 5 hives max and give all the splits and swarms away.\n Comment: I actually lucked out: I had a friend from church donated a TON of boxes/frames so I didn’t even have to buy any to start out. All I had to purchase was a suit, a smoker, etc, and the hives themselves. Later I won a grant for $1,000 through FFA so I’ve made nothing but profit.\n Comment: Good honey is quite expensive these days so beekeeping as a hobby will probably pay for itself, if you like to eat honey and also others in the family do.\n Comment: Every hobby is expensive if you lack the ability to craft what you need to do it. If you have basic carpentry knowledge and the patience to try and catch wild swarms then it doesn’t cost much. But if you have to purchase everything from the boxes to the bees on the frames then yeah you’re gonna drop some cash.\n Comment: Very. But as things go, it could be worse, and it’s very relative. \n\nYou can literally spend as much as you want. A full 14x12 (with 2 supers) hive of first-quality cedar can be £500 or more. A starter kit, first cedar, close to £700 or so. A colony of bees (in correx) can be £250. \n\nAs it goes, as a hobby… it’s not *that* bad as long as you give yourself a limit, because once you have a limit on how many colonies you want, everything else can be sold for big bucks. \n\nSay you limit yourself to 4 or 5 colonies. So buy 6 hives, and one 4x hive stand, and a backup pallet. Maybe get a couple of nucs just for safes. \n\nYou can overwinter your extra splits, and sell colonies of bees for £200 locally easily - the money you paid for bees? You can get all that back. Raw honey is £5/lb. Comb honey sells for a lot more, especially if it looks good. And full frames of comb honey that look A+ can sell for £100 or so to affluent venues / people. \n\nIf you’re forced to make the split, do and sell the nuc. If you wanna demaree, then do so, and sell the mountains of honey you’ll get from it. My point is, many other hobbies you could spend £4000 on stuff, and not realise it because it’s spread thinly over years …\n\n**In summary:** In this hobby you *could* just keep expanding, but if you set yourself a limit and sell your extra overwintered stock, you can get money back on the bees you’ve already bought, and if you don’t split, you can sell the honey 🤷‍♂️\n Comment: I don't know. I spent £500 in my first year and made that back in honey. I'm a few years in and have spent £2400 so far this year. I've made back £1800 though. I still have about £300 left to put in but I think I'll make about £4k in total maybe £6k at a push. \n\nThe issue is before you have that £6k coming in you have to spend £2k. There is money in beekeeping and it can be expensive but I don't think you should loose money in the hobby unless you're especially bad at beekeeping.\n\nHowever, with this all said I'm not accounting for time. If I costed my time I'd be well in the red.\n\nThis is selling honey and nucs by the way. I might make another £2k in lip balms but before that I'd need to spend another £500 on tests and packaging.\n Comment: I thought it was expensive when I started out. Then it got pretty cheap for a few years when I had all the equipment and was getting a high percentage of colonies through the winter. Then it became profitable for a few years. Now it's expensive again as my original equipment needs replaced and I am expanding, but overall still profitable. But then again ... This isn't just a hobby anymore... It's a small business.\n Comment: I got all in with equipment (full hive, suit, hive tool, smoker) and a NUC for $750 this spring. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen things got a little crazy.... I built some more boxes, caught a few swarms, and now I have 5 hives. My friend got into beekeeping for just the cost of a suit and smoker since I had bees to give him. Can be cheaper if you have a hookup.\n Comment: 1st year 2 packages, 2 hives, stain for hives,  jacket and veil, various tools, costs of beekeeping class and memberships I'm running about a grand.\n Comment: Priced it out a couple times, usually about a grand to get off the ground\n Comment: I harvested my first frames from HoneyBound hive. I gave it away. I told my friends and family that received it that it was valuable honey! It was about $300 a bear bottle 😂. \n\nOn the plus side, it saved my daughter a doctors visit as she used it on a bad lip burn, has already eased allergies, AND according to my family, tastes better than the honey from Sam’s and the local farmers market.\n Comment: I've spent about $2500 the past 2 season so far. And I got 11lbs honey lmfao\n\nMy strongest hive keeps Swarming, I have 6 hives from my original 2. And equipment isn't cheap lol \n\nI've started making my own now. Since I have some woodworking experience and setup now.\n Comment: Beekeeping is as expensive as you want it to be. You can get started for under $100 or more than $1,000.\n Comment: I've probably spent about $1500 over 3 or 4 years on equipment and bees, I have 4 hives worth of brood boxes and enough other equipment for 2 hives. \n\nI value convenience over saving money. My initial startup costs were about $300.\n Comment: I'm a new beekeeper in Southern California. This is my first year/season. I purchased a nuc instead of a package, which was about $400. I got a nicer suit for about $190. I got 2 Deep boxes + plastic frames + top and bottom for $250. Smoker was $30, gloves $30, & hive tool $5. I got all this at my local bee supply store to support the mom and pop shops instead of going through Amazon.\n Comment: Anything you love doing can be expensive, it’s cost vs reward. It’s cheaper than golf or tennis.\n Comment: Yes, it's been pretty expensive for me because I'm learning that, with Carniolans, I always need double what I think. Those girls are *crazy* prolific. I had to do an emergency split because they filled up 4 boxes in 6 weeks and were already trying to swarm. A lot of the expense is in the first year, though, just from buying all the tools and such, figuring out what you like / what works for you, etc.\n\nIn addition to what everyone else is saying here, I did spend an additional $1400 at the hospital because I put an industrial staple through the bone in my thumb tip while building some frames. Stupid reverse stapler. I don't recommend doing that.\n Comment: Yes.\n Comment: I couldn’t tell you how much I’ve spent over the last few years, and I give all of my honey away, so I haven’t turned any kind of profit, but there’s worse hobbies\n Comment: If you’re buying your boxes and frames, yes it can get pretty expensive and there’s little return on investment for the first two or three years depending on how big you start and get.\nIf you can build your own gear, it’s not so bad.\n Comment: Bears have ruined about 2k worth of my bees in the past 2 years .\n Comment: Yep it is\n Comment: Yeah it is expensive..for me it didn't cost much caught half a swarm from a chimney so I bought like 2 floors and so far that's the only thing I have spent, trying to build up the size as a lot of them died due to the co2 in the chimney.\nI don't use a smoker or any serious suit but I'll have to invest at some point because I had an issue of the entire hive attacking me after someone came and stole a few frames soft the already small hive...\n\nIn general with the sugar I used I have spended around 70-80 euro.\n Comment: I'm in the UK and have just started my first hive in total it's cost me about £700 split roughly as follows:\n\n£400 - A nuc of bees + national hive + frames (1 brood, 2 super and all the associated bits)\n£300 - tools and equipment, most of which is a high quality bee suit. I've seen suits range from £30ish to £200ish depending on how fancy they are.\n\nEquipment wise there's a number of things I probably got before I needed them too\n\nMy understanding is if I do splits most of my set up costs for additional hives will be for more boxes/frames, and if you're selling honey and other hive products it self funds after a certain point\n Comment: I've been told this by my friends who are bee keepers: \"If you can light a $100 bill on fire without remorse, your totally ready to bee keep.\"\n Comment: Your first expense should be one of the many good informative books that are available. Study it. First Lessons in Beekeeping, by Keith Delaplane for example.\n Comment: It's probably about $1000 US to get started. Compared to some other hobbies I've had or have like motorsports, it's really cheap. To me bees are kinda like low maintenance pets.\n Comment: Costs are items needed for beekeeping including boxes, jars, medicine, etc.\nA big one, opportunity costs, are also in the mix. If you could be working overtime instead of beekeeping, then you have that too.\nHowever, if you do it right, rewards can be tangible (money for honey, bees to sell, etc.) or intangible (peaceful mind, sense of accomplishment, marvel, and wonder). How a person calculates the combined value of the intangible and tangible is up to them. I find it a satisfying hobby.\n Comment: Absolutely.  A decent hive, without frames is about $100.  You then need frames and foundation, as well as bee safe paint for the exterior.  You want at least 2 full hives to start, so you are at about $400 at that point.  Then a suit will cost about $100.  A package of bees runs about $200 each, a nuc about $300.  So now you are at $1000 and you still need a frame lifter, hive stands ($80x2), smoker, smoker fuel, feeders, more sugar than you’ve ever seen, hive tool, mite checker jar at minimum.  Optionally you may want a frame holder, queen marking equipment, screened or slatted bottom boards, Romberg screens.  Then there is treatment for pests: Swiffer pads and beetle jails for small hive beetles. Chemical treatments for Varroa mites at least once a year typically.  And at this point we haven’t even addressed honey.  A cheap single frame hand crank extractor is going to run at least $100, nicer electric or multi frame ones ones cost much more.  Then you need buckets, honey gates, strainer screens, uncapping knife and fork, jars….  So first year to start, assume about $2.5k for two hives.  Then spring of your second year another $1000 for honey collection supplies.  You will need to replace your queen somewhat regularly, and sometimes they just die or are rejected.  If you aren’t rearing queens (which is an additional expense) you need to buy new queens for about $90 each about every 1-2 years.  You also need to buy new hives and frames as they age and wear down.  In addition to the financial cost, there is a physical and time commitment.  Your hives need to be checked weekly for health, during the hot and humid summers.  A full medium super weighs 40lbs.  A full deep box for brood weighs 60lbs.  You have to either lift these full, or find a way to hold individual frames when you are inspecting.  And during honey collection, the whole super has to go at once to avoid robbing.\n Comment: If you intend to do it to get some honey it will be the most expensive honey you ever \"bought\". Beekeeping is a scale business. Small operations have high costs due to investment into infrastructure and supplies with minimal return (often honey for the hobbiest turned sideliner) until you can get some size and diversify your revenue streams (queens, nucs, candles, etc). It is often said the best way to make a million dollars in beekeeping is to start with two million. HtH.\n Comment: I started beekeeping about 3 years ago. That cost of 2 hives, medications, clothing, reading material, 2 packages of bees, tools, and buying a lot of my stuff online(which was slightly higher at some of the places I chose, but I liked their boxes more) it was about $1400 USD. \n\nI am sure there are cheaper options, but you would really need to do your research and price out everything needed.\n Comment: Assuming you go the conventional route:\n\nA single hive with wax ~ £200\n\nSuit, hive tools, beginner kit ~£60\n\nIf you're in an allotment they'll probably want you to set up some Hera's fencing and shade cloth etc to secure your hive ~£50-100\n\nHoney extraction can range from 0 (squeezing) to hundreds\n\nThen spares/Extra frames etc call it another ~£100\n\nSo maybe £400 to start up all in\n Comment: I spent £375 on 2 hives with frames, £200 on one nuc, probably £200 on clothing, tools, smoker fuel etc and now looking to try make or find a cheap honey extractor. And I’ll just make a split next year to fill the hives. Other than that I don’t know if I’d want to spend much more as it is just a hobby so not sure what to do with the extra bees after that\n Comment: If had someone tell me they wanted to start beekeeping just so they could have a little honey. \n\nI told them it’s way cheaper to just buy it.\n\nAs far as a business startup it’s not the most capital intensive. \n\nAs a hobby you do for a little honey. Plan on spending around $100 a jar for the first few years. That’s not an actual estimate, but I think you get the sentiment.\n Comment: You should run 2 hives vs 1.\n\nNucs cost around $270 each.\n\nThe box costs around $250 each.\n\nYou need a suit.  I recommend the ventilated ones.  That's around $250.\n\nAll in you are probably running $2k to get started.\n\nOf course you can save money and do it yourself or catching swarms and such...but then you are trading time.\n Comment: Might be a late reply but for anyone who might stumble across this(note im from the Balkans, prices seem to vary hard).\n\n2 hives(including frames/foundation) was about 90€.\n2 swarms?(Dunno the correct term) were 80€.\nPants/jacket/veil/knife/smoker all together was just a bit under 50€.\n\nFrom zero to two hives and all needed equipment to start is round 230-240€ here.\n Comment: I am simultaneously sorry and pleased to see your first year startup costs. I had estimated a startup cost of $1100 for first years for two hives when I taught an intro to beekeeping class this spring.\n Comment: Be careful using frames from another aviary, you never know if they're carrying AFB or some other virus.  Unused frames are fine, though.\n Comment: For 3 hives and equipment it cost me around $1100 in europe. However I haven't bought anything \"honey extraction\" related yet.\n Comment: I need to get a mentor\n Comment: … and you need storage space. A lot!!\n Comment: *less than £100 easy\n Comment: I built a top bar a couple years ago. Dad was just getting into bees and I got a bucket from him. Other than that I bought some gloves and suit and hat\n Comment: Sounds like you didn’t start that brand new.    But carry on\n Comment: This is a solid answer! Gives the good and the bad.\n Comment: Very comprehensive answer. Respect.\n Comment: Love the DIY spirit here\n\nAny experience with homemade vaporizers? $150 seems a ripoff for what amounts to a 120V electric resistance heater\n Comment: I started this way, but I'm done with that now. Had some unexpected splits and a swarm and was short on hive bodies this year and didn't have time to make anything. Bought two painted and fully assembled deeps with frames from mann lake for like $140. They arrived in three days, I took them out of the box, popped some of the foundations back in, and placed right on the hive. It was so easy! No glueing and stapling frames, priming and painting boxes, assembling everything. It was done. Had I paid myself for the labor and time for all my previous equipment the true cost is a lot more than that. I've got a 10 month old and my hobby isn't woodworking, so if I'm doing that I'd rather it be a project for the house. I don't see myself making equipment that often anymore.\n Comment: Same. This is the way, if you can.\n Comment: Yes. I decided to make my own wax melter one year, and it was fun, but by the time I took into account MY time it would have been cheaper to buy one.\n\nMoney saves you a lot of time in this hobby. For someone who truly enjoys woodworking or assembling frames, that’s great. For me those aren’t the enjoyable parts and I’d rather pay Mann Lake or similar to handle them.\n Comment: This is very true if you're starting out. Once you get a couple years in and start doing splits, the hobby can pay for itself.\n Comment: $750 for a full hive? You guys are being ripped off. In SA a full Langstroth hive costs $150\n Comment: You should build your own boxes and hives. Very easy, and way cheaper. $35ish per box and frames.\n Comment: 👏🏼\n Comment: I spent about $1500 my first year. In Ontario, Canada. So not to bad. Another $800 this season cause my hives keep Swarming (after I split). And equipment isn't cheap lol\n Comment: I’d say you’re pretty spot on with your set up estimate. Mind you, I intended to only have 2 hives. Now I have 4 haha\n Comment: You’re right. I got my donated equipment from my mentor though, and we knew they were all good\n Comment: So true. I met a beekeeper the other day who rents a storage unit just for his bee stuff. And damn does he need it 😂\n Comment: What do you mean?\nI started completing from scratch\n Comment: He started with kitchen scraps and smarts sounds like more than you have.\n Comment: Fair point. I start working on stuff at 10:30 after the wife and kids go to bed and keep staying out until 2 am.. it's a lot. But where do you find the time otherwise?\nGotta keep costs as low as possible though\n Comment: Lol \"this is the way\"\nIf Mandalorians were beekeepers...\n Comment: Well even with splits, you've either got new hives and frames, or packages and nuc boxes if you intend to sell nucs to maintain the hives you have.\n Comment: It can also cost you your ass if you play your cards wrong. All hobbies are expensive. I don’t think beekeeping is out of line with other hobbies cost wise. When your hobby becomes profitable it can lose its fun for a lot of people. \n\nIf you’re getting into bees to make money you need to treat it like a job. If you’re in it for a hobby don’t expect to make money but enjoy it if it does.\n Comment: It pays for itself if you sell nucs large-scale and if you use the “cross your fingers and hope nothing goes wrong” approach to complying with business laws (insurance alone costs me $450 a year).\n Comment: I’m talking full hives.   2 deep supers frames.   Hive stands, paint. It’s not near $150\n Comment: That’s awesome.  I’d love to try now that I have set up ready for several.  Can’t buy a 2x4 for $35 here!   But I’m sure it’s the way to go\n Comment: We call that bee math! It is why I have 10.\n Comment: Sorry buddy, you just don’t qualify to be a “new” bee keeper.  You didn’t get the memo?\n\nI’m only playing.  I too have no idea why you aren’t brand new, so don’t carry on, cuz you could be doing it all wrong! 🤪\n Comment: Sorry.  Typically you don’t start by build your own hive and catching a swarm.   Pretty unusual.  That’s all I meant\n Comment: Unless you are selling bees queens and honey on a large scale you aren’t coming out ahead.  Certainly not getting started.   5 years down the road if you are full time maybe start to recoup and get in the positive.   My point was…. It’s not a easy or inexpensive start up hobby.   I believe that’s what op was referring to.\n Comment: We have been doing this for about 7 years, and a lot of family/friends know that we do it, so we get calls for swarms very often. We have actually traded some swarms for boxes.\n Comment: It's literally <$350 for the least cost effective option of a fully assembled kit.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mannlakeltd.com/traditional-growing-apiary-kit/\n Comment: Here is a full basic/starter beehive in South Africa (admittedly only one shallow super, and no hive stand) but the price is about $90.  Ps Honey costs around $10 per liter here.\n\nhttps://beehappysa.co.za/products/bowden-langstroth-11f-32mm-w-10f-35mm-super?variant=32590850162770&currency=ZAR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&srsltid=AR57-fBBqiJXsOUYjTo-mhY_z6XMTft2uxTRoD74YKLWeoFAxwmGUFiK9Yo\n Comment: 😂 you’d think I’d have learned my lesson with chicken math. I started with 6 chickens, now I have 16. 🤦‍♂️\n Comment: Not sure how common or uncommon it is but that it what I have done. Even just had a cheap jacket and veil and wore jeans for a couple years until I got tired of bees crawling into my pockets. \n\nIt may not be the easiest but it is possible.\n Comment: You can learn these skills on the internet. It's not rocket science.\n Comment: I didn't realize there was only one way to be a beekeeper lol\n Comment: Yes.  I have crunched the numbers.  If you've got super mutant stellar hives that all bring in fantastic numbers... at $10/lb (which is about all you can get when competing with $7/lb invert sugar syrup imported from China and India and sold as \"honey\" down at the grocery store),  a hive that produces 200lbs of honey (a bit unrealistic) is about $2,000 gross. If you're lucky enough to have the space for 10 or 20, that's 20K-40K MAYBE per year.  But when you take out all the equipment costs, costs for new equipment...  even if you're seeing few losses and splitting colonies instead of buying nucs and packages, you're still looking at net neutral or net negative.  When you factor in your time?  Nope, sorry, nothin.\n\nI mean.. once you get to about 10-20 hives or more, you're in the range of breaking even or coming away with a profit.  But not enough to make a living.  At least not in this economy.  And then you also have the issue of trying to sell it all.  Most people, in this economy, can't afford good local honey.  Especially not when you can get a 5lb jug of \"honey\" down at the large retail stores for the cost of a 1.5lb jar of local honey.\n Comment: That's good.  That helps out a lot.\n Comment: Not a manlake fan.  Ford Taurus of bee hives.\n Comment: I prefer to take the hard route. Do you still enjoy it after that? Then it's worth investing more time and money in.\nPlus, you learn a lot jumping in head first into the deep end. There's no sense in nerfing all the corners.\n Comment: For comparison, over 10 years I've built a half dozen hives, lost countless colonies, and caught only one swarm.\n\nI've collected a few swarms and done a trap out and a cut out.\n\nI'm easily a couple grand deep doing things cheaply.\n Comment: Youtube is an amazing resource for learning anything you want. Someone that's industrious and motivated can learn all they want to know about a topic and start by building their own materials.\n\nIt's what I prefer to do.\n Comment: I love it when people argue with me on Reddit that “if it says honey on the label it must be authentic even if it’s from China or India”. Yeah bro I’ve been to India three times, love the people and the land, but by no means am I trusting their imported honey!!!\n Comment: We sell our honey for $100/kg.\n Comment: I have no opinion on Mannlake not having used them, but I definitely LOL'd at that comparison.\n Comment: It's a price data point for Mr $750 and not an endorsement.\n Comment: I still absolutely love it. I have upgraded to a full suit and built more hives so I am no longer staying super cheap but I now know, and am very fortunate to have the financial means, to be interested and invested in this hobby. I had all the tools and most supplies needed to make hives. \n\nJars are my largest expense by far these days.\n Comment: Completely agree with this.\n Comment: Everyone has different experiences. I was just sharing mine.  I have definitely spent money over the years but starting out can be done affordably (with patience). \n\n I have been fortunate to capture swarms and have only had to requeen two hives over the years.\n Comment: I was reading a study, couldn't find it last time I looked for it.  But China wasn't even the worst.  They tested a bunch of samples from a bunch of different countries... India and like 3 others... 70% of the honey samples contained no actual honey.  It was invert sugar syrup.  I can make it on the stove.  I HAVE made about 30lbs of it for making Kilju because it closely simulates honey, but costs about $2 per 1 gallon batch.  I prefer real local honey and to make real mead.  But sometimes, a cheap alternative for the day to day can help you appreciate the good expensive stuff for sharing with friends.  A 1 gallon batch of mead requires about 3lbs of honey.  Which is about $35-$40... compare that to $2 for 3lbs of sugar, a little lemon juice, and 1.5hrs at a low simmer and 3/4 cup of an herbal tea at the end so it doesn't turn to rock candy... it comes out similar to honey.  That's what I used for my experiments for testing different nutrient and step feed regiments to get a good clean finished product, before using real honey for the good mead.\n\nBut yeah.  That study, they tested like, almost 500 samples from 17 different countries in the middle east, Asia and a few other regions... most came back adulterated in some way.  And some contained no honey at all.  Lije... the amount of honey sold worldwide per annum, does not match up with the reported honey production or harvest.  And exceeds it by an astonishing amount.  And that's the REPORTED honey yield.  So there's people clever enough to cook the books, and a TON of dumbasses that either haven't figured it out, or just don't bother\n\nAnd people are like \"there is NO adulterated honey in the US, it's ILLEGAL!\"  Yeah, so is distilling.lmao so are drugs.  So are a LOT of other things that are a legitimate thing.  When it comes to honey adulturation in the US... well if you've got the money, you can get away with murder.  You think there aren't some of these laboratories or inspectors getting a kick back to turn a blind eye?  Anyone who believes that must also believe the everybody in politics is clean and honest.lol\n Comment: $50lb?  How?  Also... good luck getting that in the states.  The ones I've seen here are around $10-20/lb.  And even at $20/lb you likely won't get it unless it's a special monofloral like Teupolo, Berseem, Sourwood,  Apple, Blackberry, blueberry etc.\n Comment: I’m not Lexus or flow hive guy either!    Give me a tacoma hive! 😂\n Comment: I am looking forward to the journey. It's something I've always been interested in, and it all kinda fell into place this year. \nI gave up processed/complex carbs, gave up nicotine and weed. I don't drink. So i had to take up a hobby.I finally had the means and the drive to get started.\n I've got plenty of boxes built. I don't need too many hives. Start with 2 this year, maybe 4 next year. We'll see how the swarm season goes, lol.\nBut it's been fun for sure.\n Comment: Never heard of Kilju, looks interesting. True story, I started beekeeping so I could get honey for making mead. These days I spend most of my time on the bees and only make mead for the holidays.\n Comment: In my area, I can buy a 5gollon bucket for 8 per pound.\n\nThey maybe run 200 - 250 hives.\n Comment: [Marketing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/zt9al7/we_sold_multifloral_honey_today_for_100kg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n Comment: Ahhhhh so you've got money to spend but want to appear like you're a purist 🤣\n Comment: Kilju is basically the sugar wash used for shine.  It's basically just sugar, water, nutrients and yeast.  But if you make invert sugar syrup, the sugar syrup has a similar sugar content, sugar type, acid content/pH and moulisture content to honey.\n  If I were to make a 3 jars of invert sugar syrup the way I make it, set down 3 jars of honey from different sources, and 3 jars of the honeys cut with the invert sugar syrup.  Probably 9 out of 10 people wouldn't vmbe able to properly separate them into the 3 different groups.  And that 10th person would have to be REALLY keen and still struggle.  Hence why I use it to make cheap hooch and test recipes, hljust in case they don't turn out.\n Comment: Lucky.  Still...\n Comment: You know... I ain't even mad.  Dude... if you could do weddings instead of those stupid little bubbles or soap things that look like white chocolate.  Even at a \"group rate\" would could still make... a significant amount.\n Comment: Yup. I used to buy it from a guy for that.\n\nThen,\nMy son wanted to keep bees so I spent roughly a grand to set him up and then he lost interest. I found a local bee keeper to tend them and invited them to keep their bees here as well. \n\nAll I wanted was an endless jar of pure honey on my counter and I got it.",

Beekeepers harvest the extra honey in the fall leaving plenty of resources for the hive. If there is an issue with the hive running out of honey, we supplement them with food. \nBeekeepers help manage pests such as varroa mites that can kill an entire hive in months. In the end, this means there are more bees in the world. \nI have been involved in many aspects of agriculture and I would argue beekeeping is one of the more ethical fields. We don’t consume resources like vegetable producers and don’t require intensive animal or human labor. \nWhat arguments have you heard for beekeeping being unethical?\n Comment: I haven’t heard much talk regarding beekeeping as unethical. I have, however, been accosted for using smoke when working the bees as well as using oxalic acid and other forms of ‘pesticides’ to treat for mites (all of which are natural elements but in higher concentrations than found in nature). \n\nIn my opinion the entire goal of beekeeping is to keep bees alive and healthy. Collecting honey at the end of the summer is just the icing on the cake. As others have said, a healthy hive of bees are capable of producing more honey than they would ever need and we harvest the extra. The honey and wax collected allows us to make sales, and in return invest that money back into the bees with new equipment, mite treatments, seeds/plants to create more flowers for forage, etc. \n\nAbout the only un-ethical argument my small mind can come up with is, that bees regularly do get crushed or die as we’re inspecting the hives. Some may consider that unethical, cruel or harmful. The issue is that inspecting and treating the hives is a necessary evil. Without digging around in the hives to inspect frames of brood, eggs, honey stores, we as beekeepers have very little idea of what the health or condition of the hive is or if mediate action needs to happen. The hive may be queen less or have an unacceptable might load, or hive beetle infestation, or a failing queens, and we would never know until the whole colony was dead. So in order to keep the colony alive and healthy, bees will inevitably be sacrificed. If you smush 10 bees during a hive inspection, the colony of 60-100k bees isn’t going to suffer a meaningful loss.\n\nWhat I truly love about beekeeping, it connects you with nature in a way that no other hobby (that I’m aware of anyway) does. It really makes you focus on the weather, changing of seasons, the plants and other pollinators, to know whats blooming, wheres the pollen coming from, whats producing nectar, what type of trees and flowers are in your area. Its a very bizarre awareness. My fiancé and I will be driving and spot flowers in bloom and have to pull over to identify the flowers. We’ve knocked on neighbors doors to inquire about plants that they have. This all revolves around the bees and paying attention to what they’re doing and what they need. Not to mention how amazingly intricate the bees are themselves. The inner workings of a colony are nothing short of fascinating.\n\nThank you for searching for your own truth. I can respect that.\n Comment: Good for you on having a open mind towards the whole situation, and being willing to change your thoughts regarding it.\n\n\nAlmost every beekeeper I’ve met cares deeply for the bugs in a box. Harvesting honey is literally just a bonus. Don’t be like my neighbour and hop my fence to prevent me inspecting hives because “im raping the bees” only to proceed to get stung several times.\n Comment: About the best argument against beekeeping is that of squeezing out the native pollinators. I’ve read that there are some areas (islands) where honeybees have caused some local pollinators to go extinct, so honeybees can be viewed as an invasive species. \n\nBut where I live there is also a massive over abundance in non-native flora, most (if not all) of which is considered to be invasive as well. We have huge amounts of Himalayan Blackberry, more than all of the Native pollinators could ever exhaust on their own.  Also, there are many areas that are only farmed because of irrigation, so there are more nectar sources than what would occur naturally. The almond orchards in California are a perfect example of this. So are the apple orchards in eastern Washington.\n Comment: I believe that, unlike most other animals kept by man, bees remain a wild animal. To effectively keep bees the beekeeper must work by their rules. Bees cannot be domesticated, yarded or herded. Likewise they are not trapped within their hives. Should at any time the bees find the conditions unsuitable they can simply leave.\n\nTherefore a beekeepers sole job is to ensure the bees are happy with their surrounds and that they have nectar, pollen and water available. That they are well housed, neither hot nor cold and no predators pest or disease. Only then will the bees produce a surplus of stores which can be safely harvested. I try to never feed my bees sugar as I do not think it is good for them so I always ensure they have adequate honey to last through the season. I am only allowed the surplus.\n\nIn essence this makes me a slave to my hives. Before I receive any reward at all the bees must have everything they need. What could be more ethical than that?\n\nAs for the honey, along with natural fruit sugars, it is the only natural sugar naturally available to man. In addition to the sugars there are all sorts of trace elements and active enzymes. It also has medicinal properties (see Manuka honey in particular) and is mildly antiseptic, excellent for treating burns and abrasions.\n\nNow having said all that, I am a single man operation and I keep my bees by their own rules. I treat each hive as an individual (did you know each hive has a distinct personality?) living creature with all respect due accordingly. The honey produced is absolutely natural in every way, never heated or otherwise mucked about with.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot say the same when it comes to big business where bees and honey are treated as a \"commodity\" with a fixed dollar value. For this reason I always advise buying honey direct from the beekeeper who can guarantee the quality of honey and welfare of his livestock.\n Comment: Vegan is a very troubled religion in my opinion.\n\nCan we talk for a minute about how lettuce (and in fact most, if not all fruit and vegetables) are non-ethical for vegan consumption?\n\nVeges grow from seed. Seed (and fruit) comes from flowers, flowers are pollinated by bees. No bees, no seeds, no lettuce or fruit. \nVeges just failed the 'animal exploitation' test.\n\nTubers, (potatoes etc) grow from other tubers, no animal involved there. Except that they grow in soil which is inhabited by, composed of, and worked by macro arthropods. Worms, grubs, beetles etc. Again, failing the 'animal exploitation' test.\n\nSo, that leaves you with fungi perhaps, or algae? But.. if you look at the substrates, and nutrient sources they draw on, you find animals again, just one step removed.\n\nBeing a fundamentalist vegan must be a pretty hungry path to walk I think.\n Comment: You are already consuming products that are reliant on commercial beekeeping.  Almonds are completely reliant on commercial beekeeping, and many other fruits are nearly as reliant.  So what is the ethical dilemma?  Eating food pollinated by bees that are shipped around the country and packed into orchards at  densities so high that diseases can spread easily, or consuming a jar of local honey.  You're already doing one, why not the other?\n Comment: You could check with local bee keeping groups. There’s a community college by me that offers classes. \n\nAnd for what it’s worth, not every bee keeper takes honey. Some people do it entirely to provide a safe home for bees. I’ll leave the rest to the pros.\n Comment: Honey isn't really good for you.  Your body uses it the same as any other sugar source.  There is some anecdotal evidence that eating local honey may help with allergies.  File that under maybe, for now.\n\nI can't think of an argument for why beekeeping isn't ethical.  It doesn't harm bees in any way.  The entire idea behind keeping bees in a hive is to emulate the natural environment they prefer and keep it free of pests, pathogens, and competitors.  It is very much a pro-bee enterprise.\n\nI have a lot of favorite parts about beekeeping.  I love watching their activity both inside and outside the hive.  I love learning about their fascinating lives and thinking about how humans and bees have learned to coexist over millennia.  And I like coming across a solitary bee out in the world foraging, drinking, cleaning itself.  When you look at them up close they're absolutely adorable\n Comment: If you think beekeeping is animal abuse somehow, then I don't think you can morally argue in favor of eating crops pollinated by honey bees either.\n Comment: Bee “keeping” is kind of a misnomer anyway. It really should be “bee negotiating”. They can, and do, leave whenever they damned well please. As many others have said, the honey harvested can be just a portion of the vast reserves they generate. My favorite part of beekeeping is knowing that they like the place I set up for them honestly enough to stick around. And I like watching them fend of invaders. And the ecosystem immediately around the hives just…changes. They really are incredible little creatures. Oh and you can tell what flowers are blooming in a 2 mile radius bass on the color of pollen they are bringing back which is useless, but cool. As a good hobby should be :-)\n Comment: It seems like  you should first say why it is unethical.\n Comment: My main role as a beekeeper is helping the bees survive in a difficult situation with varroa mites and pesticides a serious threat. Most of my effort is in working to keep them healthy. \n\nThe bees do a great job of encouraging fruit and vegetable growth by increasing the yields greatly.  Even my limited backyard garden, the huge number of citrus we get is directly due to the bees and their work.\n\nThe bees produce much more honey than they can use and but taking the honey boxes off the hive makes it easier for them to survive the cold of winter. \n\nNot sure where the claims of unethical behavior come from, but I have only seen caring people in my local bee club who treat the colonies with respect and good care.\n Comment: What's wrong with bee keeping?\n Comment: Do you know a lot of animals die for your vegan food? This is life. I prefer to take responsibility for my meat, vegetables, eggs, honey etc.\n Comment: You're overthinking this one. Many things are ethically neutral, most of the time. If they're not, you might want to question your code of ethics.\n\nAs far as beekeeping, sign up for a beekeeping class, and see for yourself what's involved. The internet isn't going to really help you answer this, being present should impart a better understanding.\n Comment: Not a beekeeper, but part of caring for hives is taking honey. Bees make an an excess though, and with that, they trade it for care. The keeper takes that honey, and in exchange, they’re routinely checked for disease, mites, they’re given whole new hives when they outgrow the current one, many are relocated from situations where humans would otherwise kill them, they’re fed when there isn’t adequate food around due to season or drought.   \n\nAdditionally, because these bees are healthy and multiply, they are beneficial to the ecosystem. There are less diseased bees flying around, there are more healthy bees pollinating native wildflowers and mass-cultivated plant matter that humans consume.  \n\nSure, you sometimes have to use smoke to inspect the hives, and you always have some that die trying to defend the hive or they’re crushed as the the hives is opened or frames are moved, but this is necessary, as there are no other ways to inspect, and you need to assess the bees and their environment in case you need to treat for something. It’s a utilitarian task where those girls don’t die in vain, and when a few die or their surplus honey is taken, it’s all in service of something bigger. With the exchange, the bees live to harvest, pollinate, and improve the world for another day.\n Comment: Shouldn’t you be working this out for yourself?\n Comment: Kept bees live in almost the same conditions as in nature, just better. The hive is just as good, as any other cavity for the bees to live in. A few bees get squished when checking on them, but far more get hit by cars and trucks or eaten by birds. Furthermore there are so many bees in a hive, and they all (except the queen) get replaced every few months, so it’s a very small percentage of the bees, that get squished.\nAs for taking their honey, the bees get a little pissy when doing it, but the honey is rap laced by sugar, which for the bees is just as good.\nColonies tend also to be way healthier when kept by a competent keeper\n\nAnd lastly, if animals don’t want to be eaten, why are they made of food?\n Comment: Great question. And I'm here with what's probably a very unpopular opinion.\n\nI've been a beekeeper for a few years now. In my experience, in 'normal' beekeeping the bees are exploited for their honey. Once the honey has been harvested the bees are fed sugar syrup for them to build up winter stores as quickly as possible. Everything from the design of (most) hives to the practices used to keep the bees alive is based on maximizing the honey harvest, at the expense of the bees health. This even includes the introduction of varroa and methods to treat against it.\n\nIn factory farming, like with any other animal, bees are kept alive as long as they deliver a maximum amount of honey and discarded and replaced as soon as they are not able to do so. (See documentary: More than honey)\n\nIn Europe (I live in north Germany) the bees are more of a native species then in America, but the rise of hobby beekeeping and destruction of habitat has caused a rapid decline in wild bee populations. Which in turn has also disrupted the food chain/lifecycles of many other animals and insects.\n\nSo as it has been said many times already, I believe the honey bees don't need saving. It's wild bees and other insect species that are in trouble.\n Comment: I'm too lazy to change your mind. Do it or don't. 😋\n Comment: Most beekeeping is not ethical. Commercial beekeepers ship their bees all over the country which is really hard on them. They use chemicals to overtreat for diseases and chemically force bees out of the honey boxes to harvest and take all the honey and feed the bees sugar water instead. I know there are a lot of backyard beekeepers who take too much honey and feed sugar. Also honeybees aren’t native to North America and compete for the same resources as native insects. That said, it’s more ethical than other food sources I guess. I keep bees because I love working with them. Honey isn’t the object for me and I never feed them sugar. I only take the honey because otherwise they produce so much the hive gets jam packed.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: We make each other, and the flowers happy\n Comment: Exactly. It is in the bee keepers interest to ensure their hives are well fed, cared for and parasite free.  Just like someone who has chickens.  The eggs are harvested but the birds are always cared for.  By taking the food produced by the animals we don't harm nor compromise the lives of the animals.\n Comment: I would add on that the main reason that the bees produce more honey than they could possibly use is because the beekeeper has provided such a comfortable, healthy environment for the bees.  By providing well thought out shelter, pest control, and supporting feed in times of pollen dearth, the beekeeper enables the hive to be larger, healthier, and ultimately more productive.  It is in the beekeepers direct interest to provide for the hives every need as the more the hive is taken care of the more excess honey can be produced.\n Comment: Hello, I've stumbled upon this a bit late but would like to answer your question and get some feedback. \n\nI have read that the queen sometimes has her wings removed to prevent her from leaving. I've also heard that the queen is artificially inseminated. Is this limited only to commercial beekeeping?\n\nETA: here is a summary of the argument. I've been looking into veganism but wasn't really sure about why they avoid honey and this is what I found:\n\nhttps://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/why-go-vegan/honey-industry\n\n I am not taking sides at this point with local, small scale beekeeping so please don't feel attacked.\n Comment: One argument my vegan friend brings up is the process of re-queening when the queen is a few years old.  Although the queen would naturally be superseded,  we beekeepers often will add a new queen (and pinch the old queen).\n Comment: > What I truly love about beekeeping, it connects you with nature in a way that no other hobby (that I’m aware of anyway) does. It really makes you focus on the weather, changing of seasons, the plants and other pollinators, to know whats blooming, wheres the pollen coming from, whats producing nectar, what type of trees and flowers are in your area.\n\nThis resonates with me so much. I am so much more aware of my environment now, and my love for nature really bloomed when I started beekeeping.\n Comment: oxalic acid is organic so I don't think that's a problem.\n Comment: Sounds like the bees showed your neighbor that they like you more for messing with them.\n Comment: loool. That's awesome\n Comment: I appreciate this post. \nI m not a bee keeper but like the posts and pictures here.\n\nFather is a veterinarian (and bee keeper) and also a hunter who shoots his own deer.\n\nHe gets this so often \"how can you?\"\n\nI wish ppl would be more open minded and willing to approach other ppl perspective\n Comment: I’ve been “bee-sharing” since 2009, as i like to help educate and spread awareness over our little winged friends. I’m actually REALLY allergic to bee’s and a sting is usually a lengthy trip to the hospital after i epi-pen myself. My best friend is a firefighter and has responded to a call once, he keeps telling me i need to quit because one day it will kill me. Just trying to do my part and save the planet with my family!\n Comment: your neighbor sounds crazy hahahaha. is artificial insemination common within bee keeping. if so, can you educate me on why that is?\n Comment: Can’t be herded. A lesson my border collie learned the hard way…\n Comment: Well said.\n Comment: You are right! I had my hive for several years before I actually HAD to pull honey because they were honey bound. I just enjoy watching them and learning from them.\n Comment: Great answer! I 100% agree with all of this, especially the fascinating part. Plus cute to watch honey bees up close, tiny fuzzy pollen covered puppies.\n Comment: I eat about three pounds of honey a month, mostly in my coffee and I can vouch for the part where it helps stop seasonal allergies.\n Comment: This has always been my thought too! Specifically with the fact that Vegans should not consume almonds on the grounds that they wouldn't exists without the \"exploitation\" of honeybees.\n Comment: we have to pick and choose our battles. everything can not be 100% ethical all the time.\n Comment: i struggle with overthinking everything unfortunately, i have ocd so i often obsess over things. a class to learn more sounds nice, i might check that out.\n Comment: This can all be Googled. Lazy and entitled post. Have an issue with honey? Fine, don’t eat it.\n Comment: That's not necessarily true. Wooden beehives generally have a much lower insulation value than the average hollow tree.\n Comment: i asked about bee keeping. i don’t want to eat animals, please keep your unnecessary comments about that to yourself. i came on here to learn about one specific thing, not be berated about my lifestyle choices.\n Comment: I dont feed sugar to my bees unless is 100% necessesary. I leave enough honey to overwinter them. I own over 250 hives at the time so...\n Comment: I agree with the exploitation to an extent. Maximizing the honey harvest is a goal of mine and many operations, but I don’t feel that it has a negative impact on the bees. If I want to make a ton of honey, it is in my best interest to make sure my bees are healthy, strong, treated, and well fed. As someone who makes a living off selling honey and beeswax products, it seems silly to not try to maximize honey production. I would assume that people responsibly raising chickens also try to maximize the egg/meat production while keeping the birds as healthy and happy as can be. \n\nAs for ethics, people generally don’t care about the mass slaughter and capturing of other insects, so I don’t understand why bees, and particularly honey bees, stand out from that. I love honey bees as much as the next guy, but I hate the ‘save the bees’ movement. They are essential to modern ag, but saving the bees glosses over other issues such as loss of habitat, native biodiversity, and insects in general. I try to use my passion for honey bees to get people interested in the bigger picture. \n\nI think the real exploitation of honey bees is in the pollination scene in America. We’re trucking bees around the country to pollinate crops that have replaced natural ecosystems where native bees/pollinators once thrived to fuel our evermore unsustainable food system. Honey bees don’t need saving! Beekeepers are looking out for them. Our broken food system, however, does.\n Comment: Commercial beekeepers don’t ship bees for honey. If they were only interested in honey they would find a spot where things grow and stick with it. The bees that get shipped around the country are being rented as pollinators for places that don’t have enough and/or killed out all the natural pollinators. California is a big example of this.\n Comment: can you not read? i asked on here why it is ethical so i can hear both sides of an argument, then form my own opinion. i don’t want to follow cult like mentality anymore. i want to form my own opinions on what is and isn’t ethical, and not be so worried about a label. i have an eating disorder and am struggling with health issues, hence why i am thinking of adding certain foods back into my life in the first place. it’s also really none of your business why i choose to do what i’d like to do for myself. i need to put myself first.\n Comment: Our whole goal as beeks is to have more bees. I consider that a net positive in the world.\n Comment: And we don't have to worry about our livestock making a mess of their \"coop\" -- in fact, they assume the responsibility of cleaning it!\n Comment: I have a video of a Queen being superseded naturally. A quick pinch is far more ethical.\n\nBees killing their queen is quite barbaric.\n Comment: The queen might have lived longer, but then the hive would also get weakened.    \nIn the end the bees will kill her anyways.  \n\nEither way, a queen is just a \"cell\" of the superorganism. The most important \"cell\", but still.\n Comment: I don’t think that’s something you have to worry about. An important part of a beehive is drones. These little dudes entire purpose in life is to mate with the queen. If some crazy beekeeper wanted very specific genetics or something (very unlikely situation) and they tried to remove the drones, the bees would say “fuck you” and just make more drones. Basically what I’m saying is it is way cheaper to let the bees do something natural than spend billions trying to find the worlds smallest turkey baster.\n Comment: As far as I know, artificial insemination is only done by a couple of universities and one hobbyist in the USA. It's an incredibly difficult, expensive and very closely regulated activity. I have no idea if it's practiced in Europe or Africa. If it is, very very few people do it. European honey bees are the only insects capable of being artificially inseminated, and it's usually done to try and keep pure breeds of bees by collecting semen from drones in areas of highly pure genetics of certain breeds or races of bees. The goal is to keep these pure lines alive and available. Otherwise those genetics would get watered down eventually and all honey bees would be the same breed, more or less. This also gives consumers (beekeepers) a opportunity to select certain genetics to add to their apiary. Adding a Caucasian honeybee queen to your hive will mean all her daughters will have the extra long tongues that the Caucasian bees have, so they can collect resources from more flower sources. They're also very cold hardy. Letting the genetics naturally spread through your apiary and the area you keep your hives will benefit all the colonies.\n Comment: My family and i buy queens every three years through our local bee club. Artificially inseminated ready to rock and roll. At one point in time i was cloning queens by take eggs and putting them in queen cells. (It’s very difficult with a low success rate, about 30%) \n\nBuying a known good queen was a huge game changer for us. We only started doing it after we got a super agro swarm that was suspected africanised. Thankfully it wasn’t and we never looked back\n Comment: I don’t know anything about “artificially inseminating” bees. I can’t imagine trying to do that.\n Comment: Veganism isn't ethical at all.\n Comment: A very good read on bees is “Honey Bee Democracy” by Dr. Tom Seely.   It’s basically his PhD Thesis and data on bees and how they reproduce the oraganism, which is the hive.   He also relates it to human behavior last part of the book.  \n\nWalter Wright on BeeSource.com is some good reading, too.  In the files section\n Comment: We all have a cross to bear. You'll figure it out, enjoy your journey.\n Comment: I'm like 1000% sure dude was making a joke, so there's that.\n Comment: You never have to ask a vegan if they're a vegan they will tell you\n Comment: I agree with you but that is the majority of beekeeping. They do it to be paid for pollination services but they do sell the honey. And they are able to make more honey by moving them around because they’re moving them to places that are in bloom over and over. I’m not going to stop them but it is not kind to bees. I think it’s important to be honest and acknowledge that not all beekeeping is kind to bees.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: It is called II Instrumental Insemination and alot of breeders do it. It just takes practice.\n Comment: I think you mean grafting not cloning. My success rate is 70 %\n Comment: it definitely is, and i didn’t come here to hear opinions on that. i asked strictly about honey. please stop\n Comment: Fine, but this is so you can have cheap almonds and blueberries. It is a symptom of modern agriculture, not an isolated phenomenon.\n Comment: because i just woke up, i also edited my original post to say thank you to everyone. why are you being such an ass for no reason? i came on here asking to be educated and you’re writing multiple unnecessarily rude comments. idk what your problem is\n Comment: Ah yes that’s the term I’m looking for. I’m sure with some practice could have gotten the survival rate up but after 5 or 6 goes and sucking at it i gave up\n Comment: Yes I agree with you.",

        "text": "\n Comment: I love how you can tell that the original poster had to add the dog with the propeller hat part as to not get dismissed entirely and torn apart\n Comment: If god just wants us for our sins, why is he so insistent on telling us they're bad? Surely what he is really farming is guilt\n Comment: I can’t speak for other faiths, but I was raised Mormon, and there, the whole Garden of Eden thing is explicit text. \n\nA big part of the Mormon dogma is Agency, or the ability to do what you want. In order for human beings to…be, Adam and Eve had to choose for themselves that they wanted to live and be human and reproduce, but to do that, they *had* to be separated from God, and make a decision God wouldn’t make. So Eve partaking of the fruit of knowledge had to be explicitly *her* (and later Adam’s) decision. If God just commanded them to do it, it wouldn’t be her decision and it would defeat the purpose of the whole thing. \n\nThat’s why the concept of “Original Sin” doesn’t exist in Mormonism, because while what Eve did *was* explicitly admonished against by God, it was still his will that she do it, and thus not a sin.\n Comment: You know how when you first picked up The Sims or Cities Skylines or something similar, and at first you amused yourself by spamming meteors and disasters but when you got bored of that you settled down and started actually engaging with the game's systems?\n\nYeah I think God's kinda like that\n Comment: What weight does Virtue have without the possibility of Sin?\n\nWhat chance does Growth have without the existence of Knowledge? \n\nWe are human exactly because of our vices and urges.\n\nWe would be lesser without them. \n\nAnd we become greater through accepting them, moderating them, fulfilling them, overcoming them...\n\nIf God is All, then God must be All That is Blessed.\n\nAnd if God is All, then God must be All That is Wretched.\n\nAnd what are we but fragments of God?\n\nOn a side-note, I'm very sleep-deprived right now.\n Comment: For a bit there I actually thought about how one might expand on that theology further with the consideration of how our souls might be going through some sort of artificial selection like a farmer performs as something equatable to reincarnation and enlightenment.\n\nFor example if a soul produces a lot of sin, the desired byproduct, it would make sense that the deity would cycle those souls back through so they would keep on producing more sin. Meanwhile the virtuous souls, producing nothing of value for the deity, would exit existence upon death.\n\nThen I realized that we were kind of just inventing Gnosticism again.\n Comment: Hey don't conflate \"god must not exist\" with \"I've been fucking lied to either about god existing, or having power, or loving me, because if I was loved by a powerful being this shit wouldn't be happening\", which is more like what's that bee's muttering. In bee's case the strongest component might be power, the beekeeper is not omiscient and is totally oblivious of bee relationships. Do hive insects even *have* relationships and conflicts?\n\nFor an example where abscence of divine love or even decency is more obvious, consider the life of a cow in a factory farm. This is the argument more often relevant in everyday theology, because \"I worship nonexistant being\" and \"I greatly overestimate my god's power\" are very tolerable, but \"I worship a being that could easily end all plagues/wars/famines and chooses not to\" is Horrifying As Fuck.\n Comment: But I thought God's sins outnumbered my own!\n Comment: I would be much more accepting of the possibility of a God if most Christians didn't try to claim he is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient\n\nI still wouldn't *believe*, mind you, since there's still no evidence for that kind of claim. But I wouldn't so quickly dismiss the possibility out of hand\n Comment: It could just be souls. Does god have a soul?\n Comment: It is my firm belief that, if there is a God, we are essentially the blorbos from his show, and he gets his entertainment value from our most bizarre and outlandish behavior, especially when there is Consequences™️ for us or others.\n Comment: I believe the Canon answer is that He's farming praise and devotion.\n Comment: Actually, its perfectly reasonable to say god mines us for Virtue. In several versions of the christian mythos, god is literally INCAPABLE of committing evil or sin (despite the fact that he literally declares himself thr father of evil in one verse, but thats a little cherry picked seeing as hes referring to himself as the father of humanity there.) \n\nTo be virtuous is to have the OPTION to not be, and choose otherwise. Depending on your faith, god literally IS NOT CAPABLE of choosing to do harm, and thus is incapable of virtue. It would be like complimenting a perfectly functioning and well made calculator for getting the right answer to a question. He cant do otherwise. \n\nPerhaps theres some aspect of \"choosing to be good\" that he feeds on like a parasitic organism, siphoning this positive energy off his creations to sustain himself. Idk.\n Comment: these are some not bad world building ideas\n Comment: A beekeeper doesn’t know what their bees are thinking, but the entirely of Christianity hinges on the idea that god knows everything and also loves you\n Comment: the REAL implication of this is that god literally cannot keep us here, and we can just leave and do stuff like killing deities that are allergic to spit or whatever\n Comment: The beekeeper's power may be vast from the perspective of the bee, but it is nonetheless finite; God is, at least according to the lore, omnipotent and omniscient, so he has no excuse not to solve every problem, no matter how trivial.\n Comment: holy fuck i'm on r/CuratedTumblr (I'm houndmoon)\n Comment: I keep ants. As pets.\n\nI have one large colony. I used to have two, plus a bunch of Queens I'm trying to prove out (one is doing real well, one is hibernating so off until January or so, and one is still uncertain), but...well...\n\nI got them because I did something stupid while depressed and wound up needing a safety plan. Oops. Found my first Queen after that and it was like...I just needed a *clean* thought. Something that wasn't tied to the upteen million failures and disasters that contributed to my catastrophically bad mindset. And the ants were *clean*. They didn't give a solitary fuck that nothing I put my hands to worked out the way I needed it to, that I couldn't get a job, that my family was imploding. \n\nPretty much the only major rules for kept ants is no getting out and no going to war with each other. Which, if you're doing a good job as an ant keeper, should be easy to accomplish. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha. \n\nAll they want to do is escape their various boxes and tubs. I had to dispose of one colony, because they *ate through the goddamn aquarium silicone* and then, in the hour or so between when they managed to get out and I found them, ate a pretty valuable Queen who had just gotten her fifth worker. Ate. And because the aquarium silicone was my last ditch effort to keep them contained, whelp. If I can't keep the ants safe from themselves and other ants, I shouldn't have them. (and for the record, you cannot and should not release pet ants into the wild. This was an invasive species that isn't as bad as, say, RIFAs or Pharoah ants, but they were much more than I could manage once they reached the exponential growth stage.)\n\nI spend days to weeks making them beautiful, clean formicariums. They insist on living in test tubes and the decorative, dry-as-fuck driftwood I put in their outworld. I have learned that I have to adapt my plans and intentions down to their level and just...accept that they're going to be nasty ingrates most of the time, because their company and presence in my life is more valuable. It's great when they do what I want, it's okay when they don't as long as they aren't literally eating each other. \n\nI also *really* understand God a bit better.  Because...god, these things are so *small* and so fucking *fragile,* and I can't communicate with them at all. I have to guess when they need something (and I've gotten pretty good at guessing) and if, say, the Queen dies? there's nothing I can do. The colony is DOA under those circumstances. I had a pretty valuable Honeypot Queen who had just reached the ten worker mark (AKA the point where you can safely start feeding them regularly) who just...crashed over the course of a few days. I don't know if it was the stress of their first feeding, if it was something wrong with the Queen, if I didn't start feeding them soon enough...I just had to watch as this beautiful girl I'd spent so much time and energy rooting for slowly wind down and die. And yeah, I could go in and attempt an intervention, but that usually just makes it worse because I don't understand them well enough to keep them from stressing out so much that they croak. \n\nOne of the bigger ant-tubers, Ants Canada, has some fairly...questionable husbandry practices, but one of his better series was the time his Yellow Crazy Ants got a parasitic mite infestation. He had to yoink a chunk of the colony out, quarantine it, experiment with predatory mites to see if they would eat the parasitic ones, then get enough of the predator mites to eat all the parasites, and then destroy the remaining infected ants because the mites could spread to his other colonies.\n\nI'm studying up on how to build terrariums/paladariums because if my current Honeypot Queens make it (one is doing well, up to two workers now. The other...is not. She's still alive, though, so here's hoping) I'd love to do a planted desert terrarium with lots of flowering things for them to farm for nectar...and *damn* but there's a lot of \"moving parts\" so to speak. There need to be soil creatures, multiple kinds of plants, some kind of population control like an apex predator or a water feature, and to get it to do what I want it to do, I'll have to hit the balance just right, which *might* mean the ants move somewhere that I don't want them to, because they think their idea is better.\n\nLike now I have this vision of God trying to build the ecology of the Garden of Eden and going \"I don't *want* to put that tree there. Do you know what will probably happen if I put the tree there? They'll eat it. You know they'll eat it. And then they'll get sick, and they're gonna pass that sick on to all their offspring, and I'm going to have to intervene with that whole Virgin Birth plan--do you have *any* idea how much that's going to fuck up that poor girl's life?--to even *try* to get *something* like a cure into the system, and even *that* is going to be disastrous for them. They're gonna kill each other over it. A lot. Like, a lot a lot. But it'll be worse if I *don't* put the damn tree there. So look. It's either the tree and the disasters that will follow, or I take away their free will and that would destroy the whole point of even having them. I might as well just stick with plants if they have no free will. We'll just...have to do what it takes to get them over the hump. Remind me why I have this hobby again? Oh, right--because otherwise I'm talking to myself and I'm tired of being alone. Fine. Tree of knowledge of whatever.

We're all the different aspects of existance acting alongside and against one-another, but it's when we cooperate and share the experience of life that brings us closer to ourselves, and thus, closer to God.\n\nWhat is God if not humanity looking upon the cosmic mirror and wishing for a greater self to care and guard over all people?\n Comment: Whether you believe in the Big Bang or Creation, we're all just little fragments of God attempting to reach out for something that will make us feel whole\n Comment: >Do hive insects even have relationships and conflicts?\n\nhypothetical ones do!\n Comment: Bumblebees definitely do.\n\nDifferent hive insects have slightly different structures, but bumblebees have what's called the worker queen competition phase in their growth cycle.

Abuse the power of the Dark from the corpse of Manus, the Primeval Man.\n Comment: Is that what that show’s about? I was talking about Homestuck (/Minecraft/Undertale/other Fourth Wall breaking media)\n Comment: 🥚 *What the fuck are you two talking about*\n\n🔵🟢\n Comment: You basically have to build a box, put things on the box so they can't get out (baby oil, fluon, baby powder), and then watch to make sure they don't wear out the barrier, that they're eating enough, getting enough sugar, and aren't suffering from things like mold. It can be a lot of fun, but also very challenging. \n\nYou have to think like an ant. Except you *can't* think like an ant. Your brain is too big. You cannot simplify thought down far enough to understand what being an ant is like. The best you can do is guess, and watch their behavior so that you can make things more appealing for them. \n\nAnd the hardest part is what's called the \"founding stage\". You take a Queen, usually a workerless Queen hours after her first and only mating flight, put her in a test tube and leave her alone for a couple months until she has her first workers. Which is in no way guaranteed. She's more likely to die suddenly with no visible reason than she is to make it to ten-plus workers (when a colony is considered stable enough to display foraging behaviors). You do not feed her. You do not water her (there is already water in the test tube) You leave her alone. You do not take her out to check every day. Leave her alone. *LEAVE HER ALONE.* So I'll be doing maintenance on the ant shelf (Cleaning outworlds, refilling water and sugar sources, feeding) and I'll have this constant nagging voice going *I wanna see I wanna see I wanna see* and instead I have to ignore the urge to check on any one of the very desirable colonies I have in the \"Queen Drawer\". Forget Schrodinger's cat. It's Schrodinger's ant colony all the way.  \n\nI believe that God loves us, but he *really* loves the finished version of us. The us at the end of the road, after we've weathered all the experiences life throws at us. Right now, in His eyes, we are all unformed, a kind of fetal soul in a matter womb, undergoing the million small processes that contribute to a completed life...and a *lot* of those processes suck. My whole life has *sucked.* Every dream I've ever had, save one (and I'm going to get to that one in a second) has collapsed into ashes. And each time I've had to pick myself up, learn from the ashes, and keep on going. And then I had my kid. The one dream that didn't die on me, that's her. And she's my favorite human. I love her mind. I love watching her learn and grow. I hold her and my arms feel complete when I didn't even know they were empty before. And all those failures and ashen dreams of mine had to happen, because it was the course of those failures and broken things that made her exist. Before she existed, I wanted *a* kid. Now I want *this* kid. And I'd go through all of it again, even the very worst parts, so that I would have this wonderful person in my life. And she is her own person, and I look forward (Sometimes sadly, sometimes with a great deal of eagerness; it depends on the size of the current mess) to the day when she's old enough to be her own adult person and she moves on to whatever adulthood holds for her. I want to know the grownup she's going to turn into. And that's how I think God is. He wants the us that exists after we've survived, and learned, and kept on moving even when it hurts. He doesn't want the scars, but he wants the person forged by those scars, and that means the scars have to be there. He wants the people who will exist, now, because you have those scars.\n\nSo yes, God is the divine ant-keeper. And he's constantly going \"Come on, guys. We're almost there. You can do it. Just a few more good choices.\"\n Comment: Would a minor Satanic atheistic text balance it out?\n Comment: My biggest reason is that my kitten died of cancer and I don't think a loving creator would include kitten cancer in his plan\n Comment: It is basically a strawman, and irrelevant because you don't need a reason to not believe something.

Interesting. If I'm reading your comment correctly though, that implies that God, as a being who does not follow orders or sin, is devoid of free will, which uhh, leads to a lot of confusing theological questions.\n\nMainly, if God has no free will, is he really God? If he truly lacks free will, then he must also lack true omnipotence.\n Comment: I think at this point we've left the territory of allegory and went straight to creepypasta prompt.\n Comment: True, though I’d expect most omnipotent beings that aren’t pretty stupid to make themselves more intelligent or set up some system that thinks for them.\n\nThat is an interesting question, while I think it probably could create another I’m not sure how they’d interact - the classic ‘immovable object and unstoppable force’ for example.\n Comment: That is incredible, thank you for sharing\n Comment: Let me just give you one word of advice: When this happens a lot of people don't want to let go, they pay lots of money for medicine that only slows it down and prolongs their suffering.

In this case, it follows Hitchens’s razor: what may be asserted without evidence may be dismissed without evidence.\n Comment: ok, ok, I don't need a reason not to believe something absurd. that better?\n Comment: I like the idea of gods being guided by an internal concept/idea (I think I got this from the cosmere) so while they have free will, they are pushed by their own nature to do things in a certain way, like how most people are generally inclined towards staying alive. Maybe God is trying to keep balance, but his extreme virtue heavily offsets the universe, and since he can't harm/ diminish himself, he has to fabricat sin somehow.\n Comment: The whole post is about us being farmed for sin, and from biblical stories we know it takes god 1 day to create one human, and that the process is likely easier if god has access to 1 human rib.\n\nThis means that god needs humans to reproduce naturally as he is a slow creator.\n\nThis means sin can't happen too fast or people will die out, forcing god to start making new ones.\n\nThis leads to humans which are told not to sin to reduce mortality but a lot of them will be drawn to the forbidden causing them to sin.\n Comment: I am aware of the burden of proof, however that is *not* what you said in your original statement. What you said is \"I don't have to have a reason to not believe something\" which is not true because it is not a complete form of what you are trying to talk about. It's too general of a statement and actually directly opposes \"the burden of truth\" because it doesn't include any context, for instance your statement implies the justification of arrogant disbelief of absolute truths because of how you said it.\n Comment: You are overthinking a joke.\n Comment: Well, we can’t be *absolutely* sure of anything except that something that thinks exists. Everything else we build on networks of assumptions. For example, if you deny the earth is round, you necessarily deny the authority of scientific experts. Either that, or your evidentiary bar for acceptance of the claim is higher than that which has been presented. For so-called “absolute truths”, the evidence is generally so strong that one has to deny shared assumptions about reality to have an internally consistent understanding of existence, like those who propose life is a simulation. Note, though, that you don’t necessarily have to make the claim that life is simulated to deny that one’s sensations refer to something real. We may see it as nonsensical because it isn’t a helpful belief, but the burden of proof does lie on those who claim reality exists. If we go about it empirically, and say “if reality exists, then the earth is round” for every claim we make about reality and find no internal contradictions, then we can take the belief in reality as equally valid as rejecting the claim. The same can be said for any construction of deist belief.",

        "text": "Ive been doing a lot of reading and am considering starting beekeeping.  Im finding conflicting idiology and opinions so I wanted some opinions from real life bee keepers.  For reference, Im in WI and live in the country.\n\n1) How much work is this actually? Daily/Weekly/Monthly, What kind of hours am I looking at putting in?\n\n2) Im ready a lot of insects, mice, swarms, diseases and all sorts of other threat to the hives.  Its very off putting.  While these are real threats, how often is it something you really run into? Am i always going to be fighting something off?\n\n3) flow hives - do people dislike them because they are actually sub-par or are people just purists and this is cheating?\n\n4) how much do you actually get stung?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the responses.\n\nIve got chickens (layers) and these seem like less physical work than them.  It also sounds like the mites are an absolute certainty. As far as the flow hive: its \"pretty\" and it sounds like harvesting easier but if i go with this, i would absolutely plan to care for my hive appropriatly.  I understand its not a \"place and forget\" solution.  It sounds like people get stun significantly less than i expected, which is good.  I ask because i have a mild allergy. I have to do some medical testing prior to jumping in.\n Comment: 1. One hour weekly at peak season max (plus dozens of hours of learning to be a good steward of bees before you get them).  This varies a lot by season.  You do nothing in winter, but you should check once a week for the couple of months during peak swarm season.\n2. You will have to deal with varroa, 100%.  A healthy colony will deal with most other pests/diseases in their own.  If you keep bees you will have a swarm at some point.  Overall these issues don’t negatively impact my enjoyment of beekeeping.\n3. No idea, sorry.\n4.  I’ve had 3 stinging episodes in two years, six stings total.\n Comment: If you just want enough for your own use and to give away to neighbors, two hives is plenty. You may end up with more hives if you split in the spring anyway. \n\nDuring peak season, hive maintenance on a couple hives is maybe an afternoon a week? Extraction will take you a couple of days (spread out over time).\n\nPeople don’t use flow hives because they’re expensive and they don’t save that much work. \n\nI get stung about half the time I work my hives, but it’s really not a big deal.\n Comment: It scales really well. When I had two hives it was a morning a week. When I had thirty it was two days a week which was too much time for me so I scaled back to about 10ish.\n Comment: 1. In the spring, summer, early fall, give yourself 1-2 hours a week (beginners need more time).\n\n2. Frequent checks for mites must be done (every 2-3 weeks) and you need to be prepared to treat for them.\n\n3. Flow hives aren’t really cheating, they are just different, and in my opinion, too expensive and not amazing enough to make me want them. \n\n4. Stings depend on the temperament of the hive/queen. Some years I never get stung, while others, it can be so bad that I kill and replace the queen.\n Comment: 1. Amount of work really depends on how many hives you have and how experienced you are.  In swarm season, you probably want to be in the hives every 7-10 days. Summer, every couple of weeks. Winter, just need to make sure the hives are heavy, so very little work.  When I first started, I probably took 30+ minutes per hive inspection.  Now I probably do 15min (unless I find something that needs addressing).  A pro might be able to do it in 5 or less.  Work involves lifting heavy boxes and (in my climate) sweating profusely while wearing a hot suit in the heat of summer.\n2. There are a few threats, but most are easily dealt with.  Varroa mites are the biggest threat and really need to be managed actively.  Swarming is going to happen.  You can work to lessen it, but everyone is going to get some swarms.\n3. I don't know why people hate Flows.  It is a fancy Langstroth hive. They are expensive, but pretty much work like other Langstroths.  It is NOT a hands off hive as people seem to think.  You still have to lift that heavy flow super off the top of the hive and inspect.  If you have 1 or 2 hives, it might make sense financially.  If you are going to have much more than that, you probably are going to have an easier time with an extractor  (both from work flow and money-wise).\n4. I get stung a fair amount. I got stung a lot more when I had a lower quality suit.  Now when I get stung it is either because I am dealing with a hot hive or it is my fault for accidentally squishing a bee.  It happens. Bee stings are not the worst thing in the world. I'd put it up there with a fire ant sting. The worst part about a bee sting, IMO, is when you see it coming and your mind anticipates it.  When it happens out of the blue, it isn't so bad.\n Comment: I'm coming up on year 3.\n\n1 - Hive time only, average of 2 hours per week between April and November. If I'm feeding actively, probably another hour per week. This time has not changed much. My first season, I had only one hive. Now I have two.\n\n2 - Ants and small hive beetles are the most typical pests. There are ways around the ants, and you might be far enough north that beetles are not an issue. Varroa mites are a separate thing.\n\n3 - Not a partisan either way.\n\n4 - My first year, I didn't get stung. My second year, I got stung 3 separate times. I don't expect any more than that - less if I am more careful.\n Comment: Eventually they will completely take over your entire life!!!! Keeping them alive and thriving...working them successfully without damaging them...extracting honey... and then the most fun is swarm season...\nBUT ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT. BEES RULE!!!!!\n Comment: The most important single piece of advice I can give you is this:  \n*Get used to conflicting opinions.*\n\nGet 10 beekeepers in a room and we'll all disagree on everything.  \nGet 10 beekeeping books and most of them will give different instructions.\n\nThat's because none of us really know, and the bees aren't talking. We did something once and it worked, so we'll continue doing it that way forever, and over time we'll convince ourselves that everyone doing it any other way is wrong.\n\nTake everything with a grain of salt. Try what makes sense to you. If it works, keep it up. That's the essence of beekeeping.\n Comment: >1) How much work is this actually? Daily/Weekly/Monthly, What kind of hours am I looking at putting in?\n\nI have heard old beekeepers tell new beekeepers they should expect to invest 40 hours per hive per year. There are variations for each person.\n\n>2) Im ready a lot of insects, mice, swarms, diseases and all sorts of other threat to the hives. Its very off putting. While these are real threats, how often is it something you really run into? Am i always going to be fighting something off?\n\nKeeping insects outside in a box attracts other pests, animals, insects, and microbes. You will need to be vigilant in staying on top of this for your bees, especially varroa mites and the obvious care and feeding of the bees.\n\n>3) flow hives - do people dislike them because they are actually sub-par or are people just purists and this is cheating?\n\nChoosing the right tool for the right job is the best thing to do. If you want to spend 800$ on the premium select FH, and have one, go for it. If you want to spend 800$ on 2 full hive setups, your protective gear, and a small extractor too, go for it.\n\nNothing about taking care of the bees themselves resides inside a FH super. That is all about honey, and nothing else. \n\n>4) how much do you actually get stung?\n\nEvery time I work bees. Bare hands mostly. You may want to read up well on frequency of stings, allergy tendency, and how your body produces IgE and IgG reactions to bee venom post exposure to \"bee stuff\" and venom separately.\n Comment: The way I see it with flow hives is they're largely a gimmick.  If you havn't done bee keeping you may think it sounds great.  But then do bee keeping and you might find that the flow hive saves time on an activity you already don't spend a lot of time on.  I harvest maybe one to two times a year.   Most of the time is spent on hive management and if anything the flow hive is going to make that aspect of bee keeping worse.  Some people really like the flow hives, but I think the big reason bee keepers are down on it is because they seem to misrepresent what beekeeping is like and all about.\n Comment: Flow Hives are a remarkable bit of engineering and while a lot of people were resistant to them initially I think they have earned respect as an alternative super for beehives. Despite the marketing it really is just a small family in Australia that are hugely passionate about bees and conservation. They’ve created online courses to both raise money for conservation and encourage better beekeeping. I think the public interest in beekeeping generated by flow is a net benefit for the beekeeping community and the easier harvesting of honey it allows is much more compatible with most people’s lifestyles.\n Comment: 1. 30 min per hive per week is a fair guess\n2. This stuff is not too common, but if you have 30 hives, it will be an issue.\n3. Flow hives are very expensive.  If you have only 2 hives and want honey then it may make since, but if you have 3 or more hives then you can get a spinner for cheaper.  Some bee clubs will let you \"rent\" a small spinner for the one time per year that you need it.\n4. Some hive will sting the hell out of you and when you just have 2 hives its harder to deal with a bad hive (50%).  Try to get gentle queens and breed for gentle bees and its not an issue.\n Comment: 1. Depends on the season: Summer: 30 - 60 min a week at the bees per hive. Winter, almost no time at the bees, some time preparing. \n2. Most of the work is dealing with varroa. Other pests seem to be rare. Not sure about small hive beetles though - they don't exist (yet) at my location.\n3. The original flow hives are very expensive and they don't really do much. They might make honey harvest slightly easier, but that's only if everything goes as planed. What angers me more about those things is that they convey the image, that you just put a flow hive in your backyard to have basically 'honey-on-tap' without actually having to look after the bees. That's not how it works.\n4. I usually wear a full bee suit, still I get stung once or twice a year (through the suit). Do a blood test before you start beekeeping. You don't want to find out that you are allergic to bees while looking into a box that has 50.000 of them.\n Comment: They will keep you bee-sy.\n Comment: 1. Agree with about an hour a week hands on during the season, plus you will spend a few hours on setup, extracting, a few times a year. In your second and third years the work is a little less because your comb is drawn, your boxes painted etc, and you also get a bit more of a feel for when you can skip a week or two. But, there is a HUGE overhead in learning the first year and quite a bit the second year. It gets a lot less ‘drink from the fire hose’ after that. I’d plan on putting in a good 24 hours of solid study (not including researching hive types, this is just learning bees and the system you have chosen) before starting, and that’s assuming you have a good book or structured, comprehensive course. Trying to understand beekeeping by watching random videos which may be inapplicable to your location/situation, using a different system than you, or just plain wrong is very difficult and just confuses a lot of beekeepers. Join a local club and take their course if they offer it. Bees are not like other pets/livestock, they are more like space aliens, and if you don’t enjoy learning biology this may not be the hobby for you. I tell those who don’t feel like doing a lot of homework that chickens are their better option (I love my chickens too, much less stress usually, but, as you say, more mucking out/feeding/letting in and out on a daily basis).       \n2. Varroa is a constant issue. If you keep bees in the 21st century, you will eventually lose hives to them even if you do everything right.  Swarm management is usually an essential skill, especially your second year when your bees will want to do reproductive swarming. So be prepared for varroa and swarming mentally and emotionally. How much other pests are a threat varies with your location, but mice, moths, and beetles are more a beekeeper annoyance than a hive-killing threat in my area and usually are not the cause of hive failure.   \n     I personally think flow supers are fine if you want to spend the money, though I think their single foundationless brood box arrangement is too difficult for almost all beginners in my area. And I think they try to scare people too much about extracting, which isn’t that bad, especially if you borrow an extractor from your club (most have a rental program) and team up with a bee buddy. Honestly, extracting is the easy part as, unless you do something really nuts, you are unlikely to kill your hive with it.         \nIf you are worried about being stung while working your hive, I highly recommend a good suit, boots, and gloves. I have almost never had an unprovoked sting while not working a hive, but temperaments vary. In my view, if you are scared, you are probably not wearing enough PPE. Wear the level that makes YOU comfortable and relaxed because you have a ton to learn as a new keeper and nobody learns anything while terrified.\n Comment: The bees themselves - an hour a week unless you have loads of hives  \n\n\nEvery evening - watching youtube videos and reading books & websites on how to spend that hour doing the right things!\n Comment: 1. A couple of hours a week is about all I put into my 3 hives during flying season.\n\n2. Lots of things love eating bees. I've been constantly fighting off yellow jackets, hornets, bears, and ants. Diseases haven't been a problem though. \n\n3. I personally don't care for the FlowHive because it just seems so gimmicky and unnecessary. I prefer simple traditional hives.\n\n4. Fully suited, I've been stung 6 times in 3 years.\n Comment: 1. If you have only one or two hives, probably an hour a week is what it turns out to be, including set up time, lighting your smoker, etc..  In your second year or with hives that have made it through winter, from April through at least the end of may, maybe half way through June in Wisconsin you should make a quick check every 5-7 days for swarm cells. You can do it in 20 minutes for 2 hives. You won't have to do this your first year. This just means looking at the bottom of the boxes.  A thorough check for hive health about once every 2 weeks otherwise.\n2. Ants can be a problem.  There's lots of ideas out there about how to control them without harming the bees.  Or if they are not aggressive ants, you can more or less ignore them and let the bees handle them.  You will need to check for varroa and treat.  There are many options.\n3. No opinion.\n4. It depends on how you work.  I work bare-handed almost all the time, so I get stings once in a while.  I can go through forty hives and not get stung once.  Next week, I might get stung a few times.  In spring the bees don't really care that much about you, so few stings.  In the fall, they see you as the enemy, so stings happen.  You can wear various kinds of hand protection or body protection that can cut down on stings a lot.  I can't assess your allergy situation, but for non-allergic beekeepers, the recommendation is to get stung around 10 times per season to maintain your immunity.  My first year I swelled quite a bit with stings, but after a while there was no more reaction.  It still can hurt like hell, but no swelling or itching reaction after enough stings.  Hitting you thumb with a hammer is a lot worse.\n\nThere are many variables depending on climate and location.  The more hives you get, the more of everything there i: more honey, more bees, more mites, more time, more problems.  But the time per hive stays about the same once you know how to work through them.\n Comment: Ideal time of year to sign up for a course.    Most provide hands on experience from everything from equipment assembly to hands on hive inspections.   It’s such a physical experience that you really have to get to do to appreciate.\n Comment: 1.How much work is this actually? Daily/Weekly/Monthly, What kind of hours am I looking at putting in? \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Really with 1 to 5 hives it can be just a few hours a month.  Usually the busy time is monitoring during spring build up and making sure they have the space they need.  Add honey supers when the honey flow goes on.  I feel like much of the work usually goes into feeding the hives during various parts of the year when there isn't a honey flow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.Im ready a lot of insects, mice, swarms, diseases and all sorts of other threat to the hives. Its very off putting. While these are real threats, how often is it something you really run into? Am i always going to be fighting something off? \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* The big issue I've had a struggle with and many beekeepers struggle with are Varroa Mites.  You keep the mites down then you tend to keep viruses and diseases down as well.  Easy to keep mice out of hives with entrance reducers.  The other big problem I've found is education.  You need to spend some serious time learning about honey bees.  These days there are a lot of good youtube channels you can go to like Kamon Renolds or A Canadian Beekeeper.   Technically a healthy hive will eventually want to swarm.  That is how honeybees reproduce hives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. flow hives - do people dislike them because they are actually sub-par or are people just purists and this is cheating? \\*\\*\\*  I have a flow hive.  Problem I've found is you need to have it on a strong hive that really fills it all up during the honey flow.  I love having the little window on the side of it.  Personally I think it would be better to not have a flow hive.  Also if you buy a hive, choose if you want to go with all 10 frame equipment or 8 frame equipment.  If you have no equipment it is better to try and have all 8 frame because of it being lighter especially when full of honey.  If your a woman definitely do 8 frame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. how much do you actually get stung? \\*\\*\\*\\*  I get stung pretty often but that is because I go into the hives with no gloves on.  Most breeds of honey bees here in the states are pretty gentle and I've gone through a few big hives with no gloves on and not get stung once.\n Comment: I've agreed with most answers I've seen so I'll be brief. I have five hives, started out with two\n\n1. I spend about half an hour per hive per week. More in the spring and fall, less in summer, almost none in winter. (Winter is spent prepping for next year, building/repairing frames and hive boxes)\n2. Varroa, Small Hive Beetle, mice, robbing by other bees/wasps, and absconding will be your primary issues. Nosema (bee diarrhea), Foul Brood, Chalk Brood, and a few other diseases are more serious but less common. Frequent inspections are used to find and deal with these issues. \n3. As others have said, they're expensive and a bit of a gimmick, and aren't scalable past single digits. However they make harvesting MUCH easier since I don't need to use an extractor, filter, or other equipment, and the bees don't get angry at harvest time. Also they make rebuilding and refilling comb pretty fast in my experience. They make inspection much harder though given how heavy they are. \n4. I usually get stung a few times a year, maybe 10? I don't use bee suits, just a veil to keep them out of my face. You'll get stung at the beginning more, but I recommend not using gloves as it teaches you care and respect for the bees, and you learn their signals\n Comment: I started beekeeping last year.\n\nFirst, do your research.  There's probably a beekeeper association in your area.  Contact them and see if you can volunteer with someone on the weekend.  They're busiest in spring and fall, and generally won't turn down someone at those times.  If you volunteer then you'll make your mistakes on someone else's bees, and learn from them (or course, you'll also be learning from an experienced beekeeper who will hopefully stop you from making those mistakes in the first place).  There's also tons of youtube videos out there.  Trust me, most beekeepers can't shut up about their bees, you'll get tons of info (and some of it will conflict with what other beekeepers tell you).\n\nSecond, most beekeeping equipment is actually fairly easy to build.  At it's heart, it's just a box.  If you've got a table saw you can make almost everything yourself.  My first hive I purchased for $100.  All my other hives I made for around $20 worth of wood.\n\nYou'll want to start with about 2 hives.  Even the best beekeepers have a winter death rate of around 30%.  If one of your hives doesn't make it then you can repopulate (split) from the second hive, but if you don't have a second hive then getting a new package or nuc is an expensive process (about $200-$300).\n\nA handful of hives (5 or less) should take you about an hour or two a week to manage, more at harvest time.  It takes me about 15 minutes a hive, if I don't encounter any problems.  Once you get over 10 hives it starts turn from a hobby to an obsession/job.  In the winter you're not working the hives, so that's a good time to start building new boxes and frames (it takes me roughly an hour to build a hive, and I generally build 3 or 4 at a time).\n\nThe flow hive works, but it's very expensive, and doesn't save you a whole lot of time.  Like I said, I can build a hive for $20, the flow hive costs [a hell of a lot more](https://ca.honeyflow.com/collections/flow-hives) than that.\n\nI have 2 hives, and I get stung about once a month.  If I wore a full beesuit I'd probably get stung less.  For example, the first time I got stung it was because a bee landed on the crook of my elbow and when I bent my arm she got squished.  I was wearing a tshirt at the time.  My second sting was from a lady that crawled up the leg of my shorts and stung my inner thigh.  I joke that if she had just travelled a little bit to the left she could have stung something that would look better swollen, but instead she got my thigh.  I once got stung twice in one day, and that was the day that I discovered that my bees don't like being inspected when it's cold outside.\n\nI'm afraid that I can't help you much with diseases and swarms.  Swarms happen in the spring (mostly) and as this is my first year I've yet to experience one.  I also live on an island that's varroa free (for now), so I don't get to experience that either.  Our main challenge here is the weather, I've had to feed mine a lot more than I expected.  I also get earwigs.  The bees seem to keep the earwigs out of the hive itself, but can't seem to keep them out of the feeders.\n Comment: The question should be, how much time to be a good beekeeper? Piss poor beekeepers can spend little to no time.\n Comment: 1: Beehive management is about 1/2 hour per hive per week once you get good at going through the hive. Sometimes a little more during the spring build up, and a little less during the summer dearth, going average for fall winterization, before almost becoming none existent during winter. In a year, maybe 15 hours per hive. \n\nMore time is spent in prep work really than in the hives, building boxes, painting, stapling frames, waxing foundation, extracting, bottling honey, and cleanup.\n\n2: swarms aren’t an issue if you have boxes, frames, and foundation ready for adding or splitting. Mice can be an issue in the winter if you don’t reduce the entrance. Varroa are an extreme problem that need active treatment for handling (although I personally don’t deal with them as all the feral bees in my area were killed off by pesticides/fire and haven’t returned yet and my bees I think are mite free, or at least I haven’t seen any for the past few years. I still treat though)\n\n3: Flow hives are a bit controversial. There are cheap knock offs that have frames that crack easily and honey spills into the hive. Bad wood constructions plagued them for some time, and valid concerns about brood or crystalizing honey ruining them, to how hard it is to turn the keys. Up in Canada for instance, where dandelion honey rapidly crystallizes within weeks of it being capped, flow frames are basically hot garbage, down south however, I hear they work quite well for hobbyists, although expensive.\n\n4: on average maybe once per year, and usually because I’m being dumb than the bees being aggressive. Just make sure you’re opening your hives in good weather, and be cautious around dearth’s when they’re extra protective of the hive.\n Comment: Not that bad. Couple hours a week. Sometimes it’s more like if the flow is on or during swarm season (early spring). I’ve had to do a few things this winter but it’s been really warm (I’ve been feeding).\n\nThe disease management is pretty easy. Formic acid in the summer, oxacylic  acid in the winter. Check mites in each hive in between (treat or not as needed).\n\nI don’t get stung unless Im lazy like wearing shorts. I wear jeans, a jacket, lamb skin gloves, and a hat. They don’t bother me otherwise. Or anyone else for that matter.\n\nI could’ve done it all cheaper and better with planning so finding a good mentor is essential.\n Comment: 1. It's at least once weekly/bi-weekly (depending on season and your specific needs that YOU determine). Opening hives often for no reason is very counterintuitive. There are times you might need to visit your hives two days in a row (harvest, treatment, moving the hives etc) depending on your choices and your 'style'. I heard a story that a beekeeper forgot a hive in the mountains alone for a year due to moving and next year he found it booming. Bees are very independent. You just need to help them thrive (sometimes we try to do that but we do the opposite). Beekeeping is mostly choices and taking the right ones.\nI'd say minimum time would be 1 visit per 1.5 weeks and at from 2-10 minutes per hive each time depending on what you are doing. \n\n2. Depends on where you live. Where I have the bees I found and killed a snake once (in a shack not underneath the hives) in 2.5 years. There are plenty of mice leaving in the ground around the shack but I never had to face one and shoo it off the hives. There are also lizards lurking but even more passive than mice. \nWhere I leave the real problem are ants especially the smaller ones that get into the hive sometimes. The bigger ones mostly lurk beneath the hives and feast on junk bees dispose.\nAlso wasps and yellow jackets are the biggest threats and I really recommend to start laying traps for them (example tuna can with poison) early in spring until end of summer, until there are no wasps trying to get into your hives.\nThe trick to help your bees is to reduce their entrance so they have to protect a smaller area (downside is less ventilation and slower in-out from the hive).\nRealistically the only thing you might have to fight off are wasp that will not be attacking you but your hives. And you can't be there 24/7 I only managed to swat  just a handful myself. Manage hive entrance and set traps.\nLastly where I live seasonal birds (we call them bee eatets here) reduce your bee numbers and you can't do anything (legal) to undo that so don't put much thought into this last one. \n\n3. I have no experience with flowhives and I often get tempted but eventually I will not get any nor I recommend them especially to a new keeper.\nOnly upsides are what they advertise but I guarantee you those videos are in a controlled environment it will never work 100 percent like that and it will get messy.\nDownsides is that you lose from the actual experience, you can only buy parts from flowhive and not from other local vendors stuff that you might need on time's notice. There's less 'customization'.\nSo I highly recommend to get normal hives if you want to get into it, and start with at least 3-4 because eventually it will happen, you will lose hive(s). I started with 4 went up to 14 and now I got 8. 4 is a nice number I wouldn't go for more, try it out to see if it is for you then you can invest more.\n\n4. I get stung a lot. Be sure you are not allergic. Where I leave the climate is dry and really hot at summer and bees tend to be more aggressive in those climates.\nI wear jeans, and in the summer extra layer for the stings. I wear beekeeping jacket with veil and a fisherman's hat beneath it. I wear glasses and I sweat so that's also something to care about if you are the same. I recommended to have an elastic band (that is attached on the top of your veil) and wear it below your chin so the veil stays in place when you move around.\nI wear beekeeping gloves and for shoes I wear ankle height boot like shoes. Jeans go over the shoes.\nI get stung where the clothes are not loose. So try to not expose any skin and loose clothes and you might avoid many (or even all) stings.\nWorst stings are on the fingertips (I went without gloves) and surprisingly the least painful are on the top of the head (didn't wear the extra hat). In general a few beestings are not harmful at all and really not painful. The ones you really have to avoid are on the face (didn't get one still). Once you get stung you will realize it is just fear, bee stings are very mild (most of the time).\n\nIf you got any follow-up questions let me know.\n Comment: The question you need to answer for yourself is the following.\n\n \"Do you plan to take a natural approach, or an industrial approach to Beekeeping?\" \n\n If you are just weighing the \"amount of work involved\", I suggest the natural approach and using horizontal hives. Far less work for you, your back, and much healthier for the bees overall. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, please read the following book. \"Keeping Bees With A Smile\". It is great starter book for any beek.\n Comment: It depends on how much you want to be involved and who you listen to.   I went to horizontalhive.com and his mindset was to check on the bees at least once in the beginning of spring, and once in the fall to harvest honey.  I share the same mindset—- the bees are more than capable of surviving without my help, so you can be in there as little as you want.\n Comment: Many great posts here.  I am on the low end of time usage.  I will pop open the hive , if I see a good brood pattern then I know my queen is alive and doing well.  If not, this is when a second hive can provide a frame of comb to help while the girls make another queen.\nOf course harvest time is a different story with gratifying time well spent.\nYes on oxy treatments.\nno interest in flo hives.  All wood and natural foundation.  I love the smell of my extra equipment I store in my garage.\nI've been stung a zillion times and it is still an ouch which soon passes.\n Comment:  I had two hives it was a morning a week!\n Comment: Excellent thread! Appreciate the post and everyone’s great answers. Very helpful to read. I love the variety of responses on the topics.\n Comment: >You will have to deal with varroa, 100%. \n\nThere seem to be a lot of different treatments for mites available. What do you recommend?\n Comment: I will be receiving a hive as a gift soon, I  believe! What should I be studying / reading in advance? I'm in Central America if that makes any difference! Thank you!\n Comment: OP I started last year and this reply is highly accurate.  I found 1 hive to be totally manageable though I wish I had purchased two nucs so I could compare.  My plant was to buy 1, and catch a swarm but I never ended up catching one.   My opinion of the flow is that its not worth the money, but there's nothing inherently wrong with them.  I was stung...5 times last year?  (thank god for bee suits though).\n Comment: 1 hour weekly for how many hives?\n Comment: Im not looking to have honey production for a business. Im looking for a hobby for my own honey and maybe enough to sell a few jars.  How many hives would that be?\n Comment: Preach! :D\n\nI had 1, then 2, then 4, then 5, then 14, and currently sitting around 25 (with \\~50 mating nucs ready and waiting for queen season). \n\nI plan to sell around 50-60% in April if I can get the inspector here early enough. Then I can refill boxes with leftover queens throughout the year. \n\nTo the OP, there were a lot of good on-point answers so I won't belabor. Last year it consumed every spare moment. I'd probably get 2 and see. At that level 2-3hr/month should do you. The real time early-on is in the learning, reading, etc. But those are things you can do in cold weather.\n Comment: What are you doing in this one mornings a week? Is it just an inspection?\n Comment: While I agree that everyone has an individual opinion, I don't necessarily agree with the old 10+1 adage that everyone repeats adnauseum.\n\nI think when you said\n\n>That's because none of us really know, and the bees aren't talking. We did something once and it worked, so we'll continue doing it that way forever, and over time we'll convince ourselves that everyone doing it any other way is wrong \n\n...this is especially troubling.\n\nWe *know* tendencies of bees. We know many things about what they'll do when we give them a set of circumstances.\n\nOur decisions come in when their biology meets our goals. When you take the intersection of those, and add your preference... There's not a lot left. Easy decisions which aren't that ambiguous remain.\n Comment: Why would you want to read up on those things?\n\nIf you're not already allergic to bees can you develop an allergy by getting stung?\n Comment: Although even in a very gentle hive it seems there is always that ONE BEE who has an issue with you.\n Comment: Thank you. I am trying to find one in my area.\n Comment: I guess i thought that went without saying.  If i were interested in being a lazy bee keeper i wouldnt bother asking questions to learn and determine if this is for me, i would jump in without any education.\n Comment: At this point im trying to figure out the estimated time involved for both ways. Then determine if i have the capacity to commit to the way i want to do it. I wont compromise the approach i agree is the best stewardship because of the time it takes.  I will just not do it if i feel i cant do it well.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of disagreement around which is a better approach.  I feel my very very naive opinion seems to lie with an approach somewhere in the middle of letting them do what nature intended and being very hands on to make sure they have perfect conditions.\n Comment: Talk to ten different beekeepers and you will get ten different answers to this question.  I will say this.  Research the different options and talk to local beekeepers about what they do.  Your decision will be based on your own unique circumstance because of the timing and method required to administer the different treatments.  What EVERYONE should do is to incorporate their chosen treatment as part of an IPM plan.\n Comment: It actually matters a lot where you are located!  I read Caron's beekeeping and bee biology, Seeley's The Lives of Bees, and a few others.  BUT these are all written by/for North American beekeepers.  I think a lot of the biology parts would be similar, but the management most likely will not.  See if you can find a beekeeping group in your area, on FB for example, and ask local beekeepers what you should be reading.\n Comment: That’s for one hive.\n Comment: >How many hives would that be?\n\nIn Year 2 a pair of hives will give you honey to keep your friends happy.\n Comment: Three hives. If you are at least 33% successful in keeping bees alive year over year you will always have splits to do and more bees.\n\nAt 100% successful, come spring, you can sell a couple splits.\n\nAnything less than 3 and you risk buying bees yearly. If you want that, I'm not sure.\n Comment: Inspections, tidying up, splits etc. I do queen rearing now so that takes up a few evenings when I'm doing that, but if didn't do that 10 hives takes me about five hours a week.\n Comment: Yeah, the corollary to my first point is that everyone thinks it's true about everyone except themselves.\n Comment: You absolutely can.  You can get bee venom suppression therapy from your doctor if you do become allergic.\n Comment: That one bee will sting you and die.  If that one hive has 20 bees that are bitches, you can mark them and find where they live.\n Comment: The level of you hive management can be variable.  Winter requires feeding. Spring is heavy season. You can micromanage or just do min. It helps if hives are close. You can also keep bees at vacation home a d only tend occasionally. Just depends on what your goals are.\n Comment: Just some food for thought... Natural beekeeping in horizontal hives will only require you to open the hive 2 times a year for strong colonies. Spring to add frames, and Fall to collect honey and winterize. Both can be done in about 30 minutes to an hour for each hive, again this is with a strong colony. I started with vertical hives, and moved to horizontal hives this past year. I wont go back :) \n\nI spend more time watching my bees than ripping open their house. I dont use sugar, and never ever use chemicals. Strong colonies endure, and week ones perish. Natural selection and all.  \n\nMy personal thought on this is similar to other livestock husbandry,\" what is the most benefical for the propagation of healthy strong future livestock?\"\n\nI hope this helps.\n Comment: I agree with this, although I’m sure one hive with 2 supers on would keep you swimming in honey for most of the year (I think you should get about 15-20 jars out of each super).\n\nIMO it is best to keep two hives though, if one colony collapses you still have the other to work with.\n Comment: You need a bit of elaboration here.\n Comment: It's a bit more complicated. \n\nI posted [about this previously.](https://reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/of1iti/journal_of_allergy_and_clinical_immunology_a/)\n Comment: I agree with your philosophy. I dont add light to my chicken coop in the winter to maximize egg production.  I figure if nature causes them to sleep more and produce less, there is a reason and who am i to go against nature to force something else.\n\nCan i ask why you prefer horizontal to vertical?\n Comment: We also tell NewBees to consider two hives to give you something to compare. If you question what you are seeing and both hives are doing it, odds are it is normal behavior. If only one is doing it, best to ask questions. \n\nAlso a note for OP, get yourself involved in a club. Even if you are unsure about having hives yourself, you can learn and do ridealongs with other keepers to help you determine if you want to commit down the road.\n Comment: I did the bee venom suppression therapy myself (posting from the doctors office right now as I await to get this months shot).  It's a bit more complicated sure, but I took dozens of stings, had a reaction, took the therapy, got stung with no reaction.  I'm not saying I can get stung hundreds of times without a reaction but my body is acclimating to the bee venom and you have options... Talk to your immunologist.  I got my tree allergies taken care of at the same time.\n Comment: I also keep chickens, and do not add light to the coup in the winter. They have a glass window, and only get natural light.  :) \n\nI was skeptical at first... How could a billion dollar industry be wrong? \n\nIn my experience there is FAR more work, materials, and money involved with vertical hives.  Additionally, most of this work involves your back, and this work is wildly disruptive to the bees home. \n\nConsider this idea...\n\nIf you lived in a house, and every week or two somebody ripped the roof off, moved around your furniture, killed some kids, and maybe stole your food and sprayed you with chemicals..... would you feel safe, and secure? Could you be healthy and strong? Would you even want to stay? \n\nThis thought process was like a light bulb going off for me. I give credit to Dr. Leo Sharashkin for explaning it this way. \n\nAlso, way less work for my back. \n\nWin Win \n\nBefore you spend any money check out, \"Keeping Bees With A Smile\", from your local library.\n Comment: The entire point of my linked post above is to discuss the immune response. Many/most people do not understand IgE vs IgG reactions to bee venom and related bee materials.\n\nWhat you're describing does not consider frequency or regularity of venom exposure before a reaction, at all. It is also obvious you replied without reading anything linked and downvoted a link back to very good source material.\n\nEdit: minor clarification",

        "title": "DO NOT BECOME A BEEKEEPER",
        "text": "I took a 9 week class, passed my certification exam, and am now a beekeeper. I did it out of curiosity and to give myself something to be proud of.  I’ll let you in on a little industry secret: If you become a beekeeper you suddenly become VERY interesting. People want to know if you get stung (Short answer, yes. Long answer, only when I do something stupid). People want to know if they can buy some honey (of course). But most of all, people want to know why you decided to farm stinging insects. \n\nThis one’s easy. Beekeeping, in my opinion, is far and away the most captivating activity in the world. Sweating in long pants and a veil on the hottest day of the summer is absent from your mind when you open up the top cover, peer into your hives, and witness the natural phenomena that is a hive at work. The smell of a healthy hive, getting to watch foragers return home with full pollen baskets, finding the Queen and watching her check which cells need an egg. I am utterly enchanted by the bees. Can you imagine a society with perfect altruism, selflessness, and division of labor? If you can imagine it, can you witness it? I do every weekend. \n\nYou’re probably wondering why I’m gushing about my bees if the title to my story is, “DO NOT BECOME A BEEKEEPER”.\n\nLet me explain, because I have an agenda. \n\nYou’re going to lose money. Aside from the startup cost, you should expect to regularly have the unanticipated need for additional equipment. Your gloves will grow holes in them. You’re not going to have enough honey supers one year (the boxes that bees fill with honey for you to sell). A hive will starve to death over the Winter and you’ll need to replace it come Spring. But it’s not about the money. It was never about the money. \n\nYou shouldn’t become a beekeeper because it is dangerous. \n\nI’m sick of the reputation bees have, and I realize this is a weird position to take. My friends are constantly sending me links to these big internet beekeeping personalities - you may have seen them. They don’t wear suits, or even a veil. Don’t get me wrong, experienced beekeepers can get away with that. If you use smoke properly and don’t accidentally kill bees, you will likely not trigger their alarm pheromone and get stung. But not wearing a veil is irresponsible. People are going to think bees are just harmless and cute little ladies, like anytime spent with bees can’t turn into a nightmare with no warning. Like they can’t communicate with each other, telling their friends to come sting you again in the same place. Like they aren’t smart. Like they don’t know that the weakest point on a bear (you) is the face, specifically the eyes. \n\nBees don’t think like we do. They don’t have the same sense of self preservation that we do, and the single cell (the lone bee) will give it’s life for the survival of the larger organism (the hive). \n\nYou probably know this already, but when a bee stings you, it dies. The barbs on its stinger are lodged as deep as it can muster into your skin, and when the bee attempts to fly away, the bottom half of its body gets ripped off. This may not seem like an evolutionary advantage, but keep in mind that each hive will contain about 25k-60k bees that can do the same thing. When each individual bee will only produce 1/12 teaspoon of honey in their lifetime, and each hive can produce 60-100lbs of honey in a year, their true strength lies in numbers. \n\nI don’t want to give anyone the wrong impression here. I’m not here to argue that bees are bad because they can sting you, it is a good thing that they do have such a powerful defense mechanism. They are arguably the most important creature on this planet. In any given meal you can expect for every 3rd bite of food to be as a result of a pollinator. If the bees die, we die. \n\nAnyway, here is the story of why I am currently trapped, typing this message while probably dying in my house while an ambulance, unreachable, waits in my driveway. \n\nMy favorite day of the year is extraction day. The day I harvest all the honey. A perpetual grin on my face, it was a beautiful day in late June when I made my way to the apiary. The trick is to harvest your honey during a nice day when the bulk of any given hive’s population is out foraging for pollen and nectar. It means you will have less bees to contend with as your vulnerable hands are working within the frames.  \n\nI’m zipped, gloved, fully sealed. Like I usually do, I feel invincible once I put on the suit.\n\nEverything is going well --- I’ve wrapped my honey boxes in thick plastic garbage bags and set them off to the side. It’s looking like I’ll get a couple hundred pounds this year, a phenomenal haul. \n\nAbout to place the final top-cover back on my hive I get stung on my hand. Through my glove. This is unexpected, but not entirely abnormal. The words of my old eccentric mentor echo to the forefront of my mind, “Jeans tight around your thighs? You may get a surprise! “ and then he’d cackle like he’d just told the funniest joke in the world. \n\nTo be clear, I do get stung through my clothes sometimes, it’s a regular workplace hazard. But all you can do is smoke the place you got stung to neutralize the alarm pheromone, remove the stinger, and get back to work.  \n\nI return to loading heavy boxes into the trunk of my car. I’m nearly finished when suddenly the heavy-lifting becomes a little harder than it should be. I’m exhausted, feel as though I can’t catch my breath, like … like I’m going into anaphylactic shock. I drop everything, run away from my hives, remove my glove and look at my hand. It has blown up like a balloon. Red and swollen, I can’t recognize my own hand. That’s when I realize my face is numb too … \n\nWith my good hand I fish my phone out of my pocket and dial 911. I feel a considerable tightness in my throat as I wait, panicked, on the front lawn. A lone bee teases me by innocently harvesting a flower in the garden adjacent. Probably one from my own hives. \n\nA firetruck blares in the distance. They arrive in record time. They take my vitals, ask me a series of questions that all seem increasingly irrelevant as I can’t catch my breath, then stab me with an epi pen. My heart rate skyrockets to levels I didn’t know it could reach as my throat begins to open back up. Gasping for air finally seems to work again. I gather myself and tell them to call off the ambulance, that I’ll have a neighbor drive me to the ER after I close up the beehives. \n\nThey look at me with raised eyebrows like I am a lunatic. To them, I’m a beekeeper who is allergic to bees. \n\nIt’s not like I had any clue until now, and believe me, I am not ecstatic about this news. \n\nBut I can’t leave my hive open. \n\nOpen hives are dead hives. It could get cold tonight, killing all the brood. It could rain tonight, ruining their food stores for the winter. They would be vulnerable to pests, a raccoon could waltz right in, the bulk of their hard work unprotected. Not to mention that other local beehives could rob the food my bees need to survive. I took hundreds of pounds of honey from them today, they don’t need to lose more to opportunistic robber bees. \n\nHands shaking, I struggle to zip up my veil. I commend myself for thinking of squeezing garden gloves under my beekeeping gloves this time. Fully equipped, I look on at my hives. Three, right next to each other. Each bustling with activity and healthy with population. I was so proud of what they had accomplished this year, and now all I see when I look at them is my own vulnerability. \n\nI need to do this quick. \n\nI pick the top-cover up off the ground. Bees fly out from underneath it and I leap backwards while holding in a scream that is begging to erupt from my recently reopened throat. You got this. You got this.\n\nI delicately replace the top-cover. Everything is closed back up, no incident. As an extra precaution I keep my suit on in the car as I drive my honey supers to my garage where I plan to extract the honey. \n\nAfter unloading the honey supers from the car and onto the driveway I run inside and take some benadryl. I sit down, drink some water and mentally hype myself up to go back outside, move the honey supers into the garage, and begin extraction. Trying not to think about the lack of a future in my beekeeping career, the benadryl knocks me out. \n\nI wake up on the couch, struck by the heat of sunshine through an open shade. I look at my watch, 10am. I slept until the next morning! Groggy eyed, I lumber near to the window to close the shades and to my surprise there are THOUSANDS of bees in my yard. \n\nI messed up, royally. I didn’t move the honey supers inside.\n\nA little known fact about bees, if you leave honey outside your house, bees will find it. Then they will return to the hive, do a little communicative dance, tell the other foragers where the food source is. You probably know this if you’ve ever brought honey to a picnic. \n\nA dark cloud surrounds the trash bags filled with my honey boxes. My honey is being stolen in front of me. I watch them incredulously from the window, wings fluttering against the walls of the trash bags from the inside. They found a way inside the bags. They found my honey and are stealing it. \n\nI don’t know what I’m going to do.\n\nGo outside, risk getting stung again. Stay inside, lose a year’s worth of hard work.\n\nI don’t care if I get stung, I’ve been stung probably 30 times in the last several years. \n\nI’m going outside. \n\nI try to decide if I’m being brave or foolish as I zip up my veil. I don’t come up with an answer, but decide that they seem like the same thing until you know the outcome.\n\nMy mission, to move the honey supers from the driveway into the garage. Without smoke to mask their pheromones. The best (only) way to do this? Open the garage, pick up each honey super individually, move them into the garage, close the garage. \n\nIntense feelings of panic and regret flood my mind as the garage door opens leisurely and the honey boxes come into view. The amount of activity on the bags looks to me as though every beehive within a 10 mile radius has found my honey and are gorging themselves with as much as they can. \n\nPreparing to hit the button again, close the garage door and cut my losses, the bees behave with unprecedented aggression. They stop what they are doing. The rustling inside of the bags pauses, as if they are all communicating with each other. Acting as one unit, a flood of bees fly directly towards me into the garage. Landing on my veiled face, from the inside I see a hundred abdomens attempting to find purchase through the mesh , each thrusting inches from my eyes with suicidal determination. \n\nFor context, Apis Mellifera, the type of bee I keep, and the type robbing my honey (my bees stealing their own honey back?), are cherished worldwide for their tameness.  There is a reason those internet beekeepers can scoop handfuls of bees up with their bare hands. \n\nBlinded and afraid, I do something you should never do to a bee. I flail my arms, swiping bees off my face and body, crushing some, further angering others. My vision momentarily unobscured, I gather myself as best I can. I close the garage. One press, it stops ascending. More bees fly into the garage from underneath and whirlwind around me. Second press, it slowly descends back down to the ground. I don’t wait around to see it return flush with the ground as I pivot back inside and slam the door. \n\nGood news, I didn’t die, or even get stung? I may discover I have once the adrenaline wears off.  \n\nBad news, there are hundreds of bees in my house now, most of which seem like their only goal is to find a way under my veil. \n\nI can hear little bodies collide against the door as I hold it closed against creatures that have no hope to open it. \n\nLuckily, I was anticipating there being some bees in the garage while I extracted today. The chemical spray you use to shoo the bees out of your honey supers works to rid the boxes of most, but not all. I spend the next few minutes shop-vacuuming bees off my face and body. \n\nAside from a few bees out of reach on the ceiling, I’ve mostly cleared the house. The shop vac sounds like an irritated hive, thousands of bloodthirsty bees frustrated by their new constraint. \n\nI go to the window to look at their activity outside. As the swarm comes into view, their activity once again comes to an abrupt pause. As if they know I am inside, the bees bee-line towards the window, the soft taps of their bodies colliding with the window growing louder as they increase in number. Fortunately for me there is a pane of glass in between us this time. \n\nThis aggression is atypical behavior to say the least. You can usually work with one hive for an extended period of time before their patience dries up. The fact that they sensed me when I was standing in the garage is mystifying, the fact that they aimed mainly for my face is even more bizarre, and the fact that they are trying to defend themselves from me while I am inside a window and NOWHERE NEAR THEM is extraordinary.  \n\nI back up into the kitchen and am shocked to find that there are bees on all of the windows of the house. Thousands of bees, each running along the length of the windows, questing for a way inside. For no other reason than to get to me.\n\nI am fully surrounded. Feeling like a cornered dog, I decide I’m not going to go without a fight.\n\nI reach under the sink and grab hornet killer spray. The kind I tell other people not to use against honeybees.  \n\nI spray whatever bees I can inside. Against my better judgement, I spray my own arms and legs as if it were sunscreen. Heaps of dead and disabled insects line the floor of my house. \n\nI gather the courage to open the door to the garage. Just an inch or two, so that I can squeeze my arm out and open the garage from the button on the wall. As soon as the door is open a swarm of bees whiz by through the opening and into my house. I panic-spray the cloud, killing hundreds, but thousands enter unbarred. Those that are inside fly in a hurricane formation, as if waiting for the opportune moment to strike. I press the button to open the garage and as I retrieve my arm from out of view I look on in horror as my arm is completely enshrouded with frantic bees. Each attempting to sting me through my suit. \n\nI feel a tickle on the back of my neck. A bee must have managed to get inside my veil. \n\nIt stings me on the back of my neck, a familiar wide needle penetrating my skin, followed by the feeling of wings tussling my hair as surely it is dying, its body bisected.  \n\nI get stung again, the same place, right on the back of my neck. Two bees in my veil?? \n\nA third time. I am in agony. \n\nFlashbacks from my allergic reaction yesterday … my body covered globally in hives, hands swelling, my face unrecognizable.\n\nI maniacally swipe at the back of my neck, attempting to crush the bees in my veil. \n\nThe bee comes into view briefly as it lands on the front of the inside of my veil, inches from my face.\n\nThe Queen. I recognize her right away. Queens have a distinct body shape. They are longer and are a different shade than the rest of the bees in the hive. The are also unique in that they can sting more than once without dying.  \n\nThe bleak realization hits. My hives are punishing me for stealing honey from them. There is no other reason the Queen would be here instead of at home laying eggs. She is risking the life of the colony for the sake of revenge. \n\nI flatten the Queen by clapping two hands together in front of my face. The remaining bees, already aggressively trying to sting me everywhere on my body, lose their minds. They know the Queen is dead. They assemble into one unit, a tornado on the other side of the room. \n\nI take out my phone and realize there is no possible way to dial 911 with gloves on. My body momentarily free of bees, I remove my glove. \n\nThese bees are shrewd. They know my hand is unprotected. \n\nIt is impossible to navigate my phone’s touch screen while repeatedly getting stung on my hand. Seemingly every available surface was stung in the five seconds I had my glove off. In between the fingers where it hurts most to get a papercut. Underneath my fingernails, all over my palm. I panic-strickenly replace my glove, but they are already inside of it. Some are crushed against the walls of the inside, others manage to sting and die a warrior’s death.\n\nThe 911 operator answers. Through tears I hurriedly explain that I am allergic to bee stings and have just been stung multiple times. Please, though, tell whoever comes to stay in their car. \n\nI can’t leave the house, an overwhelming tide of insects will blanket me if I try. I can see the ambulance by the street, waiting for me to come sprinting out of the house. I haven’t yet summoned the courage, and even if I did, it’s not as though the EMT could provide care while they are repeatedly being stung by my bees. \n\nPlease, for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT BECOME A BEEKEEPER.\n Comment: Wow, I wish I could say more but, I just... Wow\n Comment: I've seen those hornets or bees channel on YT, they have quite the viewership. \n\nYou should've recorded all these down and start a YT channel.

Think africanized. Frequently you can't manage the bees enough to find the queen to requeen them.  If you put a trash bag over  the hive and insert dry ice they will die from CO2 overload since they aren't getting any oxygen.  This is a pesticide free way to be able to reuse your equipment.  \n\nIf you spray them with pesticides you have to throw everything away.",

        "text": "So, I like bees. There is a single [commercial beekeeping program in my province](https://www.niagaracollege.ca/environment/program/beekeeping/#overview) so I'm somewhat considering beekeeping as a plan B for a career due to low job prospects in what I actually went to school for. However I wouldn't want to go back to school for a full year just to not find good job prospects. I don't mind moving if I have to, I just want to know if I can expect to find an industry job more-or-less right away\n Comment: Most commercial bee keeping (in the US so may be different in Canada) involves transporting the bees around the country to wherever they are needed tk pollinate a specific crop.  Bee hives from across the country are moved to California for the almond crop every year.  Don’t know about the pay, but it’s not the kind of life I’d want.\n Comment: I own a bee business. Most folks make $15-25 in the industry unless you are spectacularly well skilled and fast. \n\nIt's not uncommon to have a crappy year and lose money because the neighbor sprayed something. \n\nThat being said, in an average year you should be able to net around $70 per hive on average. (Though everyone in the comments here will disagree with their one year of 200 lbs of honey per hive.)\n Comment: Hot, back breaking work for $15 an hour.\n\nMaybe better than roofing, but not by much.\n\nGet yourself into a skilled trade like electric or plumbing.\n\n\"The quickest way to make a million dollars in beekeeping is to start out with two million.\"\n Comment: I turned my hobby into a sideline business. It's a great supplement to support a hobby if you enjoy it. The bonus is that friends and family, and neighbors should all support. For most, they don't even care about the cost. I extracted it at the end of July, and I'm nearly sold out.\n Comment: There are jobs in beekeeping, but it's a really hard line of work to make a living in. You work extremely long hours, and it's physically very demanding, especially around honey season. Even in the winter, there's a lot of work every day; you spend the winters getting ready for spring.\n\nThe generally accepted minimum to make a living as a beekeeper, where I live, is to maintain about 1,000 colonies; more is better. That is a LOT of bees to manage, especially if you're doing it in temperatures of 35-40 C while wearing a bee suit and moving around boxes of bees and honey that may weigh 45 kg.\n\nMost beekeepers do not make a living solely from honey production; the usual deal is that you sell honey, and also make and sell nucs/packages/queens, and also sell equipment or commercial pollination services.\n\nIt's not particularly hard to make a very modest profit if you're a hobbyist who sets up to sell your surplus honey and the occasional nucleus colony, provided that you are good about tracking and minimizing your expenses. But as you scale up, the profit margin thins pretty rapidly.\n Comment: Knew a guy here in Oklahoma who got out of it to work in IT. He said he made more money in IT and he didn’t have to get up early and do so much manual labor in 100deg heat. I got the impression that he was making 50-75k, but I have no confirmation on that number.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I make money beekeeping. It started as a hobby, I wanted a few more tomatoes in my garden with less work. I barely have a garden anymore. I go to the 4-H meetings, farmers markets, and anywhere else on farmer might end up being. I place highs on their land so that they pollinate their crops, and do not charge them. I give them the gallery or two of Honey every year. I sell my honey at a local farmers market, in Mississippi and still get $10 a pint for it. I sell a lot of it in a couple of stores, and a produce guy that sits in his truck. It's hot working in the summer hopefully there's some heavy lifting involved, and you will get stung by bees sometimes a lot. I enjoy the work and I like the bees, and after a few years I've started making money in it this year. Good luck.\n Comment: The often repeated phrase is that no one every got rich being a beekeeper. Yes you can make a living, whether its a good one depends a on your definition of good. \n\nIndustry magazine like the American Bee Journal have job ads. Whether you can land one is going to depend on your experience, how well you interview, willingness to move, travel, and work outdoors in heat with stinging insects. Some of the work is seasonal.\n Comment: I make money beekeeping. It started as a hobby, I wanted a few more tomatoes in my garden with less work. I barely have a garden anymore.

You can make decent money selling queens once you develop a good reputation. If you're in an area with alot of keepers and are good with wood you can make alot of money selling frames and boxes etc. as well as selling nucs in the spring. You can also make good money selling venom, pollen and propolis, but you have to be willing to treat your bees poorly to reap these things. You can make money selling trendy bees wax candles on Etsy but it takes a lot of wax so you need to be constantly harvesting newly drawn out frames which has to be a pain to the bees. Check out the university of Guelph they have lots of courses and ideas.\n Comment: It’s very hard to make a living in beekeeping. And by hard I don’t mean “you can do it if you just grindset hard enough”. Any ag/farming is very risky year to year because there is so much out of your control.\n\nThere’s a professional beekeeper where I live who is a biologist by trade; she sells nucs and teaches, and makes a modest living because she has built up an excellent reputation for her knowledge and the quality of her bees. She’s an exception. She and I also shake our heads good-naturedly about a mutual acquaintance who is slowly going broke on his bespoke honey business.\n Comment: Kind of a weird side thing, but I figure I'll give my two cents.   \n\n\nI'm trying to get my solitary bee population to over 250 cocoons, because if I can maintain 250 cocoons year after year that's enough for my residential bee house, and I can sell the excess.   \n\n\nI got 25 reeds of average 5 cocoons so 125, about halfway there, but my bee house next year is going to be a lot bigger and hold closer to 120 reeds compared to the 40 or so I had this year. I also plan to do both leafcutter and mason bees next year so if I can maintain both populations over 250 then I should have quite a bit of excess cocoons.   \n\n\nIf someone were to do this on a bigger scale and keep the cocoons free of chalkbrood and pollen mites then there is quite a market for sales seeing as the only place to really procure them now in north american is Saskatchewan\n Comment: No\n Comment: Are you looking at the commercial beekeeping program?\n Comment: My sense (wholly unsupported) is that unless you get huge, (1,000+ hives), you're not going to be making more than low to middle income. Perhaps 50K, every penny of which will be earned by sweat and stings. If you start rollin' 1000s of hives, you could see a jump to 100,000+ but you'll have to have employees and a logistical empire to suit.\n Comment: I live in a farming community in PA and this huge here but you can remain pretty local and make a living at it. Unfortunately most of these \"professional bee keepers\" don't intend for their hives to last more than 1 year. They have breeding hives at a central location and then they take new hives, drop them off at the pollination location with a ton of boxes on them and then don't touch the hives again until next spring. If the colony is still alive they leave them if not they drop off a new one. Really propagates the spread of mites in my opinion.\n Comment: 400 hives times $70 = $28K\n\nDo you pay yourself a salary on top of that, or is $28K what's left to feed your family?\n Comment: Our mentor told us this quote too 😂\n Comment: how much did it cost you to get everything set up?\n Comment: The benefit of that is, beekeeping is a great side hustle due to the fact it’s not hard to turn a nice profit on them if you’re Switched on.\n Comment: That's materialism for ya, money over quality of life (of humans and animals). Same mindset goes in dairy and poultry industries.\nLocal farms for smaller communities don't have to resort to such aggressive practices.\n Comment: Most commercial folks in the states run 1,000 hives per person. Most make anywhere from $0 to $150k a year. Average being around $70k.\n Comment: Are you my wife? Narc! JK We figd it out. I started with new equipment and two nucs. Then I bought packages this Spring and a whole bunch of used equipment on marketplace. Rented an extractor for $25. All in, with mason jar packaging, I'm at around $2500. Now I've gotta decide to produce with what I've got or to expand again.\n Comment: I find it easier to take care off bees than goats\n Comment: I live next door to a massive apple and peach orchard, as far as the eye can see. The apple blossom honey in the spring is amazing. They put out 3 hives for pollination and then they never touch them. All that amazing honey just sitting there untouched....it's a shame. I asked them if I could harvest and manage but they're Mennonite and I'm not so they won't deal with me. This area is so full of hobby bee keepers peddling local honey, honey isn't worth much.\n Comment: And by \"expanding\" does that mean you'd work twice as hard with twice the amount of equipment?\n Comment: Who mentioned goats?\n Comment: Not necessarily. It might mean working twice as much, but again, it would remain enjoyable. Expansion most likely would include buying wooden ware and additional extraction equipment, extractor, uncapper, holding tank etc.\n Comment: I did. Dang what makes people in this sub so unfriendly\n Comment: lol I wasn’t being unfriendly I was just confused.",

        "text": "I assume everyone is like me and watches alot of bee keepers on youtube. The bees on there are always super calm and usually the beekeeper isn’t wearing gear or very little. How realistic is this. My bees are definitely not that calm. Only my second year so I definitely am not as quick as someone with more experience.\n\n Comment: It is possible to manage bees without a suit but these videos choose ideal settings and make it seem like there is no reason to have a suit. They very often show someone installing NUC and not managing 2 deeps full of bees. This is very misleading for beginners. I find that it makes sense to wear a jacket, veil and disposable gloves even when the bees are very docile.\n Comment: I've handled hives without gloves/suit/etc...but I wouldn't recommend it.  Obviously they were super chill at those times. And many times we've worked on hives and thought that we didn't need to be all suited/gloved up.\n\nBut 99% I'm suited up when working on hives.\n\nWhen we take our honey we're out in the open.  Away from the hives but they eventually find us.  I've taken honey with thousands of bees flying around without any suit/gloves.  Again...don't recommend that.\n\nI doubt many of the vids of those people getting swarmed and stung make it into their published videos.\n\nI feel like I can tell when bees are active/curious vs aggressive.  Behavior and sound changes.  When they start bumping or the tone changes...I back off and give them space, regardless of being suited up or not.  \n\nIMHO...beauty of beekeeping is that there isn't much that can't be done a couple of hours later or the next day.\n Comment: This very much depends on a lot of things.\n\n* Where you are located. Many of us live in areas where the locally adapted bee is mean -- either partly Africanized or ... just mean.\n* Queen state of the hive - queenless hives can get mean\n* State of the environment - in a dearth, they can get very defensive\n* Outside influences - if they are being bothered by a predator at night (skunk, bear, etc)\n* Internal pests - If they are sick or full of varroa, they can get grumpy\n* size - little colonies are almost always nice.  That same genetics may be a terror when it is large.\n\nI wear a full suit always.  I've had my ass handed to me by angry bees before. It isn't fun.\n Comment: Sometimes my bees are calm enough to work them with minimal PPE; if they have a low mite load, the weather is warm and sunny but not too breezy, there's a decent flow of nectar, they are queenright, and there's not too much small hive beetle pressure, then I might be able to go out and do a quick inspection in nothing but a veil.\n\nIt is a thing that can happen. The problem is that it isn't reliable, except MAYBE when you're handling a little 5-frame nuc. And you can't always predict whether they're going to be calm or defensive until you take the cover off of the hive.\n\nIf I go out there in mid-July, when it's hot as hell, there's a dearth and maybe a drought, there's robbing, neighboring feral/unmanaged colonies are dropping from varroa and becoming breeding pits for SHB and moths? They might start headbutting me before I even open a hive.\n\nMy observation has been that when you see people doing beekeeping on YouTube without PPE, they fall into two distinct groups.\n\n* Very experienced beekeepers who breed selectively and have been applying unrelenting selection pressure for years on end to ensure docile hives; they know their bees and they are taking a calculated risk. Often, they are so habituated to apivenom that they no longer react to stings.\n* Beekeepers who are curating the hell out of their content, and only filming the times when they happen to deal with calm bees. They do it either because they want to seem like the previous group of very experienced beeks, or, or because they are pretty people; you can't tell they are pretty if they are swaddled in beekeeping PPE.\n Comment: I suit up every single time, without question. It’s really not worth it to me to get stung.\n Comment: Yes, I've done inspections without any gear. But if they are grumpy (early or late season... or just a bad day) Then I'll put the whole suit and gloves on.\n\nI also do the full suit if I'm going to be in the hive for a long time. That seems to eventually get them annoyed.\n\nI've also stopped and gone to get the suit because things didn't feel right.\n\nMostly, I've not berm stung. Flip-flops van result in a sting on your toes from the guys on the ground. Also, you want smoke handy. If you get stung, smoke helps prevent that turning into multiple stings. Also, they only seem to sting when both hands are full and you need time to free up a hand!\n Comment: What's your comfort level for being stung?\n\nOften times experienced beekeepers will take the minor annoyance of the occasional sting over the trouble of suiting up, especially if it's hot out.\n\nAfter a couple dozen stings received in a season, your reaction to stings will be greatly diminished or go away entirely.  At this point a sting only bothers you for a few minutes before it is forgotten.\n Comment: I find the more you work with bees the calmer they get, knowing your not there to harm them.  BUT, if you are located in SW, or Southern US I wouldn't go by that , the presence of Africanized bee's is a know fact in these areas\n Comment: In some areas with some bee races it is definetly possible. We (father and me) can manage our 10 hives without any protective gear most of the time. I don't even own a suit and only put something on to protect my face, when they  seem to be in a bad mood. \nI don't mind getting stung occasionally.\nWe usw the most protection when catching a swarm.\n (Central Europe)\n Comment: Many experienced beekeepers breed queens themselves, so they select for gentle genetics. Honeybee Research Centre in Guelph has a video on managing towards gentle behavior which has great info on this: [Managing Towards Gentle Behaviour (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LL2LLvmgQg).\n\nIf you buy a purebred queen, all her daughters will be F1. The daughers of those queens will be F2 etc. The further you get away from the purebred queen, the more unpredictable behavior becomes (not neccessarily more aggressive / defensive, just that you don't know what you're going to get). That said, I can work my bastards without gloves too, but generally F1 / F2 give you a lot more certainty.\n\nIf you don't want to put a lot of effort into breeding queens, you can still make sure that splits get requeened from brood from colonies with good genetics. So for example if you make a queenless split, you could break all rescue cells after 9-10 days and then provide them with young open brood from your best colony.\n\nEdit: and another part to this question is that you learn how to handle bees gently if you work with little gear a lot. With experience you will also become a better judge of when you can work with little protection and when it's absolutely a bad idea.\n Comment: Let me preface this with the fact that I am a first-year beekeeper and currently do not have my own bees, but am in a mentorship program with hives in my community in tandem with experienced beekeepers an am echoing their input from the hives we've maintained.\n\nOf those hives, the majority of them are quite docile.  A few, in particular, barely seem to even need smoke- the girls are just super chill and get about with their day even though we're in the hive doing inspections, etc.  \n\nWhen inspecting these hives, the experienced beek I've worked with only wears a veil (and clothes, obviously, lol...), and it's not an issue.  No stings at all, everyone is cool.\n\nIn contrast, there is another hive within 20ft of the docile one that is currently particularly aggressive.  Standing  in close proximity and the line of sight of the entrance yields an active investigation and during inspections there are often a lot of bees landing on you and trying to get to your face.  Without a full suit/gloves, the likelihood of a sting is virtually 100%.\n\nAs was explained to me, when all other factors should yield docile bees (weather isn't bad, you're not wearing black, nectar is flowing, etc), the remaining variable is typically queen genetics.  Because of the mating behaviors of bees, you can get some varying genetics and that sometimes means you get Africanized behavior (the \"Mean Genes\").  A queen with these genes is going to continually produce this kind of behavior in workers, so the solution is either to tolerate the behavior (with the main benefit being that these types of bees tend to be tenacious is defense as well as foraging), or re-queen the hive.   Re-queening the hive is obviously an involved process, but should in-theory replace the aggressive genetics of the hive over time if successful.  Another thing that was noted to me was that while benefitting from the tenacity of the aggressive hive, you also risk genetics from those drones getting to other hives and \"spreading\" the aggression, so it's a risk.\n\n\nAgain, I qualify this with the fact that I am regurgitating advice and instruction from beekeeper mentors of mine and do not have direct experience with this yet.  Hope the input gives some perspective, regardless.\n Comment: Often, especially on the \"boutique channels,\" (attractive woman, long loose hair, no gear, full makeup) the \"beekeeper\" isn't actually doing most of the work, and it's a crew of people off camera who are doing the heavy lifting, cut-outs, etc. Through the magic of editing, it looks like the host is doing work when, in fact, they are not.\n Comment: Depends on the species of bees you have but most of all it depends on the colony. My hives are incredibly docile but since they are Iberian bees they tend to be more aggressive. If I am careful enough I could inspect with bare hands. (I don't because I have an allergy). So it really depends on the hive.\n Comment: Every colony is going to be different. I've got one super calm colony and one that is much less so (still not what I'd term aggressive though)\n Comment: Watch commercial beekeepers and you will see them suited up.  They work bees more than we do and with the exception of Randy Oliver they wear veils or jackets at least.  I often will wear just a veil depending on what I am doing but will have a jacket nearby if needed.  Right now where I am the spring weather is nice and the bees are so busy bringing in resources and caring for brood protection almost isn't needed. \nBut when we started raising queens and you make a packed double deep queenless watch out. Same for late summer and dearths as others said.\n Comment: I had Russian bees last year. They are called moderately aggressive. Well they were just vicious. Stung me on several occasions through my bee suit. Just relentless when they attacked for the slightest provocation. So moderate means extremely aggressive.\n Comment: I always wear gloves and a bee jacket with veil. If the bees get pissy, I leave the hive and walk back to my truck and put on a full suit. I'm a big fan of NOT getting stung. Last year I may have been stung once. And I manage 40 hives. Proper PPE helps. (And I was never in a hurry or not using smoke.)\n Comment: Temperament of our bees is variable and often unpredictable. I don't like wearing a lot of gear (it's hot, cumbersome, reduces my dexterity), but I also don't mind getting stung.\n\nMy wife, on the other hand, suits up like a biohazard technician.\n Comment: I have a hive that has, for the last couple years been Very Gentle.  Like, I can put a mosquito net over my face, shorts and tshirt open the top to check brood patterns and not worry.\n\nAbout 4 weeks ago, they went queenless (Split), and became angry A-Holes, as in they start bouncing off my head when I get within 30/40 feet.   \n\nThere is a mated queen in there right now, and I am waiting for them to cool off.\n\nSo, to answer your question - Yes, sometimes it's realistic, but NO, not always and I won't open a hive without something protecting my face, ever.\n Comment: I don't own a full suit, but I don't crack my hives without a veil on.  It takes zero seconds to put on and it just seems foolish not to.\n Comment: I always wear atleast a veil getting stung on the head hurts.  So usually I wear pull up boots, jeans (no holes please got stung on my knee and that sucked), jacket with viel and gloves.  My bees are very calm but like any animal they can get pissy\n Comment: I suit up every single time, mostly because I don't like being afraid, or worried, or hurried, or stung. \n\nSo, in order to be really effective, and calm, and thorough, I suit up.\n Comment: I have two grumpy hives out of 18. I’m always geared because they are spicy and expressive.\n Comment: sometimes its genetics sometimes its the behavior or odors of the beekeeper. Hurting just one bee might set off a spicy colony. Some gentle colonies are extremely forgiving even after a beekeeper makes a devastating mistake hurting many bees. Oftentimes the weather plays a role, queenless colonies are spicy, varroa-mite-ridden colonies are spicy. Bees are more defensive in times of food scarcity and near the end of the warm season when they cannot gather anymore honey.\n Comment: I feel like I am a cat with tape on their feet with gloves on even in the winter time for the snow and I think it puts me at a bigger risk of dropping my frame\n Comment: right time of day, and right weather and they tend to be all good when well fed and they know you. but its not exactly suitable at all times of year. in saying that, I don't have a suit but on bad days ill wear my veil and hoodie + pants. often in summer I do quick inspections, and have my veil beside me if they get flighty. smoke tends to be key, and picking a time when foragers are mostly out.\n Comment: I heard that Siberian bees, are pretty agressive. You don't want to be looking into your hive without a veil.\n Comment: I don’t watch beekeepers on YouTube, but I can imagine it’s a shit show of braggadocious misinformation. \n\nThat said … I seldom wear a suit and often won’t wear a veil and almost never wear gloves. I used to do the whole suiting up thing. It’s nice for new beekeepers to have an impenetrable suit of armor. And it’s good for commercial beekeepers that want to be quick and not careful. Of course some bees are mean and some are more calm. The weather makes a big difference as does the time of day/year. It also depends on your movements and skill level. If you are clunky and knocking things around or squishing bees, they’ll get more upset. Even breathing can be a big difference. If you’re breathing right into the hive it will irritate them, although I’ll often blow on a frame to clear the bees off the brood I want to look at. \n\nWhen I had 150 hives and worked all day every day, I’d rather tolerate the occasional sting than wear a suit in the heat. If you’re calm and careful and can read your bees, you can get away with shorts and a tshirt. I’d always recommend a veil, though, because the risk of a sting to the eye is too much, even if I don’t always follow my advice. In the fall or questionable weather the bees get more cranky and a veil is necessary, a suit is sometimes necessary and even occasionally I get out the gloves. \n\nSo, it depends on your skill, confidence and willingness to risk a sting. I don’t mind the occasional sting, have calm bees and hate the heat, so I do what works for me.\n Comment: I watched a guy on a TV show removing killer bees, no equipment other than a smoker. He even said \"you might think that I'm not getting stung, but I've already been stung about 40 x's. I'm just used to it.\" \n\nWhat an idiot.\n Comment: Plus editing.  Anything they don't want you to see us edited out.\n Comment: Speaking of, does anyone ever do three deeps?\n Comment: Same. Sometimes the bees are cool, sometimes they're not. When they are not you find out VERY quickly, and that's not something you want to find out without being prepared.\n Comment: I like this approach too. Start with as little (or none) if possible, and increase as your perceived risk assessment increases. I feel like it’s ok to let your guard down if they will, but I tend to want to be peaceful with most other living things if I can be.\n Comment: I just started beekeeping after successfully moving a swarm on our fence into a 10 frame box. The idea of gentle beekeeping has been my primary driver in terms of my mental state and behavior, so mentally preparing myself to be calm and low-frequency, reducing my breathing rate and not exhaling through my mouth, among other things while near them has walked me into such a wonderful experience with this colony so far. I’ve interacted with them 3 times since catching them a few weeks ago, and each time I have never had more than a veil and single glove on at max. The last time I didn’t even light my smoker.\n\nI know this may be a freak occurrence, and seems to be reading these comments and listening to other beekeepers, but then I find little gems of similar experience like yours and think maybe I am on the right path, and setting your intentions (fully) before working with bee’s (or anything else) can result in largely better outcomes, like unprotected, peaceful beekeeping. \n\nI’ve seen lore of old beekeeping songs, singing to your bee’s to help them recognize you. I might give this a try :)\n Comment: I get on average about 1 sting from each hive once a year or so. usually during the autumn treatments etc after supers removed, I don't have the luxury of waiting for a nice day since I have to follow my autumn treatment schedules.\n Comment: I also don't have many hives so I can go easy on the frames and be very gentle, i'm not rushing to get as many hives sorted in a day.\n Comment: Gotta look cool for the camera 📸\n Comment: It’s very unlikely anyone is using 3 deeps as brood boxes as it’s a waste of equipment and time and is very inefficient. It’s also not very likely the queen will ever get up into a third box to lay eggs as she has more than enough room in 2 deeps. In fact, she actually has more than enough room in a single deep. \n\nQueens can only lay approximately 1500 eggs per day. I say “only” because at that rate, even at the height of the season, that’s only enough to fill approximately half of the cells in a 10 frame deep at any given time. \n\n[this video explains the math of it very well](https://youtu.be/YjyNcyVvbEI?si=2Z6WfCQ6uiQr3bkr)\n\nAdding more brood boxes won’t get you more bees and a larger colony. In fact, it could actually work against you, causing your hive to store honey where you don’t want it and leaving extra space for pests to set up shop. You’ll also need to dig through an extra 10 frames when doing an inspection, taking you more time to get in and out of your hive. A colony will only grow as fast as the queen can lay minus how many bees die each day. More room for her to lay eggs won’t change that. A well managed single deep brood box, supered at the appropriate times to provide room for the colony as well as a place to store honey, will give you just as big a colony as any other setup\n Comment: I did once when I ran out of honey supers. Almost broke my back taking it off when it was full of honey. Never again\n Comment: I have a few hives with 3 deeps. There is no forage right now and I'm feeding super heavy. I'm just getting ready for splits and getting them to draw some comb. In 2 weeks I'll do splits and put medium honey supers on.\n Comment: I went into the winter with three hives that were all three deep. All of them just got split twice. Bees gonna do what bees gonna do.\n Comment: I had an italian swarm in four deeps one season... brood in every box... somewhat overwhelming.\n Comment: I do 2 deeps for brood and a 3rd as a super in some cases as well as 2 deeps that often end up a bit mixed. \n\nI have a YouTube channel and I guess now need to upload the video from a recent inspection where the queen had covered the bottom box save 2.5 frames of food and was into another 2 in the 2nd on a recent inspection. I started the video to show my spouse who would not have believed me (or cared).\n\nI’ll give that queen as well as any others covering multiple boxes a raise, maybe I’ll get extra honey in that 3rd. 3 boxes of bees have a lot of foragers to make honey. Does not suck.\n Comment: Less gear definitely makes me slower and more careful, so I do like thar. And try to be just as careful with gloves on, but it is easy to be a bit less careful.\n Comment: Less gear definitely makes me slower and more careful, so I do like thar. And try to be just as careful with gloves on, but it is easy to be a bit less careful.\n Comment: Hard to accomplish with a Prince Valiant haircut.\n Comment: I’m sorry, but I have to strongly disagree with you. I  almost always use 3 brood boxes. My preferred setup is 2 deeps and a medium, but I frequently use 3 deeps. I routinely have haves with 8 frames full of brood in 2 full deeps and ow in the medium. I will admit that it takes an exceptional queen to fill 3 deeps with brood, but it can happen. Usually I end up with the top half of the top deep full of pollen/honey in 3 deep setups. But being in WI, I want the bees to have at least a full deep of honey for winter, so this is a good start. I also prefer to not use queen excluders and letting the bees determine their preferred size of broodnest works best for me. I definitely end up with bigger colonies than people that artificially restrict the size of the broodnest.\n Comment: Good insight!! Would a shallow super be appropriate at this time of year in southern Ohio?? I was going to add a 3rd deep for extra space but you may have saved me from that. Temp is mid 70s today but going into the mid 30s at night this weekend.  Shallow super today with excluder?? Appreciate any help!\n Comment: 100% 🤭\n Comment: So you have three deeps and then honey supers on top of that?\n Comment: You can disagree all you’d like, but you have not invalidated my comment. I did not say a queen will not lay eggs across three boxes. Obviously, it’s possible she will. But while it might be possible, It’s still very unlikely (and scientifically not possible) that you will get three deep boxes with 24 total frames filled with 65%-70% brood each at one time. If you are getting brood on each frame, it’s more likely your middle box is well filled and the top and bottom frames are moderately to minimally filled. And by using three deeps for brood, you are, as I stated previously, using more equipment unnecessarily and giving yourself more frames to inspect. In my opinion, inefficient. \n\nEither way, if you are getting that much brood fully across three deeps as you claim, then your experience is extremely uncommon and not something experienced by most beekeepers.\n Comment: I couldn’t comment with any confidence on what would be best for you and your hive, but what I can say is if your bees need somewhere to begin storing honey, a supper is a good idea. \n\nI do run single deep hives. My temps are in the mid 70’s F right now and my queens are currently laying like crazy. The bees are also bringing in a bunch of nectar. My hives are currently comprised of a single deep brood box, an excluder, and a deep super. When the deep super is getting close to being full, I’m going to add a shallow for comb production. After that, I’ll remove the deeps and shallows and get on as many mediums as I can fill for the remainder of the season.\n Comment: Yup.\n\nETA: normally they’ll end up with a few supers. Currently I split the hives heavily and sell nucs and ‘try not to make honey’. The hives start small and build up and end up with a a super or two. Before I did that i maintained hives more traditionally splitting enough to sow avoid swarming but still prioritizing honey and I’ve had hives so big that they ended up a dozen boxes tall all with one queen.\n Comment: I absolutely get more brood than could be fit into a single deep, which you said is impossible. I have more than 10 full frames of brood in my hives most of the summer. I’m not sure where you get your data, but a YouTuber is not a trustworthy scientific source. Even the 1500 eggs per day you referenced is lower than the more commonly quoted 2000 eggs. Of course there are a lot of factors and different queens that would make any number an approximation. I hear a lot of people talk about what bees do or don’t do based on their experience or justify the ‘information’ they think they know. You’re welcome to share your opinions, but it is unhelpful to tell people things are “scientifically impossible” simply because it does not agree with your management style, anecdotes or what a YouTuber told you. \n\nEven if they could theoretically fit all the brood in a single deep (they can’t) they like to have pollen and a bit of stores in their broodnest too. While I agree that two deeps could supply enough space for many queens, but not all, my choice to use larger brood chambers has more to do with allowing them to determine how large a broodnest they want and preparing for winter. I wholly understand that someone down south would probably find the 100# of honey I like to leave them unnecessary. I also agree that more than double deeps is probably overkill for someone that wants to use an excluder and not have any honey in the broodnest below the excluder. A single deep can absolutely used to good success, but it will impede a good queen. \n\nI have a friend that watches too much YouTube too. He uses single deeps because he also believed the videos that claim he’ll make more honey that way. Guess what, he doesn’t. My hives (even after heavy splitting) make more honey than his hives with restricted broodnests. He also has WAY more swarming and has to feed more to get his bees ready for winter (which also have much lower survival rates). \n\nThere are a lot of ways to keep bees. You’re welcome to use single deeps or double or whatever you want. Feel free to tell people on Reddit why your methods work well or even why they’re the best. But don’t come here and claim facts that can easily be disproven or make assumptions about what other beekeepers do or find successful.\n Comment: “That’s only enough to fill approximately half the cells in a 10 frame deep at a given time”\n\nHow exactly is my first sentence misquoting that? You seem to be saying that a hive can’t have more than 5 full frames of brood. I’m saying that I routinely have significantly more than 10 frames of brood, which is twice that. \n\nI apologize if my comment sounded emotional or an attack. It was neither. My intention is not to attack you, but rather to defend the sharing of ideas and experiences. I want these groups to allow discourse and discussion about different techniques that work in different situations. I’d prefer to challenge any opinions that don’t leave room for this discussion. Your original comment was beyond critical of opinions that differ from yours and claimed things that are not uncommon as “scientifically not possible”. \n\nI understand that my experiences are anecdotal and that my techniques are what work well for me in my climate and to meet my goals. I welcome anyone to point out where they won’t work or why someone else might not want to emulate them. There are absolute people who shouldn’t do what I do. But I will use my anecdotes to counter claims of what is or isn’t possible. \n\nSo, no, I don’t need to get off the internet. I hope you can pivot from trying to prove me wrong to trying to discuss things in a way that provides more information to people who want to consider different methods for themselves.\n Comment: It might do you well to reread my comments. Your first sentence here is clearly misquoting me and your responses are oddly emotionally driven.\n\nAnd while I shared a YouTube video supporting my original comment, that is not where my information comes from. It’s from information being taught in the State Master Beekeeper program held through the state Universities of which I am a part of. Many PHD level entomologists and beekeepers who have compiled information based on decades of scientific studies and research. \n\nYour, again, strangely emotionally driven attacks on me are odd and your experience you are defending is anecdotal. You should take a break from the internet for a bit\n Comment: You admitting that I “seem to be saying” rather than actually saying is an example of you applying your own interpretation of my words to my actual words and meaning. That is misquoting my original statement. \n\nI never said it is impossible for a queen to lay more than what can fit in a single deep. I did say that a queen will lay, on average, 1500 eggs per day. Which is the widely accepted average amongst the scientific beekeeping community. Average, not actual. Queens can lay as many at 3000 per day and, as we all know, as little as zero. Therefore, on average, a queen will lay enough eggs per day to maintain half of a deep brood box, as the earliest laid eggs will begin to emerge as fully developed workers by the time she gets half way through. \n\nI also said it’s possible for her to lay across three deeps of frames. You very well could have a large brood nest the covers three frames, but based on the rate a queen lays and the rate at which bees emerge from cells, it is very unlikely that a queen will be able to lay 28 deep frames worth of brood at any given time. Maybe me stating it’s scientifically impossible is a bit dramatic, but it’s definitely not the norm and a highly improbable situation. \n\nIs it possible you have hives that do this? Sure. I believe you. But in this conversation, your experience is an extremely rare situation that most beekeepers don’t experience.\n Comment: I apologize for couching my words in an attempt to be less confrontational and attempt to find some understanding. I guess I should have simply called you out on exactly what you said, but I was trying to engage rather than argue. \n\nYou never said average and were saying that the things I observe were impossible. Although, I suppose it is somewhat hard to know what you mean when you contradict yourself within a single statement: “But while it might be possible, It’s still unlikely (and scientifically not possible) …” You were stating it as evidence that a queen is incapable of using more than your preferred broodnest to further your beliefs on what is the proper way to keep bees. Trying to use the fact that some queens will not lay at all to justify your original approximation of 1500 is misleading at best. The fact that you now admit that 3000 eggs per day is well within possibility (and in fact common) is a relief. Averaging the speed of a functional car with a junker sitting in a lot is a disingenuous way to talk about the max speed. Similarly talking about the average laying of a queen and including completely dysfunctional queens in that average is not helpful. (I’m also going to restrain myself from going on about the stupidity of trying to claim the average is the midpoint between the max and the min, especially when no one tolerates a non-laying queen for long). I’m glad you are now willing to walk that back and make some statements that are more helpful to anyone considering what they should provide for their broodnest. \n\nAgain, I’m glad that you find success using single deep broodnests, but there are many successful ways to keep bees and every location has different requirements. I’d ask you to allow information that differs from your preferences to be discussed. \n\nThis will be my last post, as I am not interested in getting into an argument with a Reddit expert. I was only trying to provide a check on misinformation and provide accurate options for OP. If you actually wanted to discuss the pros/cons to what I am doing, I’d be more than happy to talk about it. But it seems you are more interested in being right than engaging in actual discourse.",

Trespass is actionable without damage. By the book, this is the tort of trespass to property. It is a unauthorized physical intrusion onto someone else's property. The plaintiff could seek an injunction against the neighbours, and so the neighbours would have to keep their bees away. An injunction is a legal remedy that does not rely on damages.\n\nThat being said, it would have nothing to do with the pollen. I don't think this is conversion because the bees are not depriving the neighbour of anything. The neighbour does not have any interest in the pollen. I think the neighbour asking the court to prevent bees from invading his yard is a fair request. I don't think the neighbour has any claim on the pollen.\n Comment: Bees generally don't forage that close to their hive anyhow. If OP is some insane fuck who doesn't like bees for some reason, he's actually in the best possible situation.\n Comment: Very interesting discussion.  What if, rather than taking hector, the harm of the bees is that the neighbour is allergic?

Like the ones who have ruined Florida.\n Comment: I think the legal phrase in question is \"de minimus.\"  It pretty much means \"insignificant\" or \"not important enough to deal with.\"\n\nEven if you could prove that your neighbor's bees were taking pollen you owned, your damages would be the value of the pollen, which is just about as close to zero as you could imagine.  Courts do not concern themselves with such low values.\n\nIf you filed such a suit against me, I'd countersue for the wear and tear on my shoes from walking into court to defend myself.  It's probably a higher value.\n Comment: This is trolling. It's not even good trolling.

It would be impossible to put a dollar amount to how much his flowers contributed. \n\nAlso, you could argue he is benefiting from his neighbor’s bees already. When the bees pollinate his flowers it makes them healthier. It’s literally how flowers reproduce.

They do have a legal right to their flowers and private enjoyment of their home without insects coming to it. And the “it’s not a big deal” argument is always going to be a weak one because it either cuts both ways or is actually a bigger deal than its cursory description. “It’s just a few bees.” But it’s just a little honey being asked for. “It’s just $1 more for Netflix”, but if it were so insignificant, why does Netflix increase their price? “It’s just a $0.49 price error at the grocery store.” Right, so it should be easy to give back that money and correct instead of ripping off every person at the checkout line, etc. \n\nNow, can they do anything about it? Probably not. Even if you successfully sued (doubtful, as a judge could see the bees as out of any reasonable person’s control) and the defendant didn’t take the smart route to just settle by giving the plaintiff a few honey jars, enforcement is going to be next to impossible.

Where I live there are laws that apply in regard to how close one can have a hive to a property line. As well, is he licensed? Has all his gear been licensed and certified by an authorized distributor or did he DIY everything? Are his hives having a negative impact on the native bee population? (IE damaging or otherwise disrupting the greater ecosystem of the community) at the end of the day, any small scale honey farm such as this should be left alone: the alternative being mega farms that have little regard for the preservation of nature and are the leading cause of domestic bee populations dying off due to outcompeting which has a longer lasting affect on the environment then a couple of bees “stealing” the nectar from your flowers.\n Comment: You all may laugh, but this was a real case back in Roman times.

It's a trade.\n\nIf he didn't want bees in his yard trading nectar with flowers ror pollination then he would grow plants that don't flower. Or better yet reprimand his flowers for just giving the nectar away without consulting him first.\n Comment: In the UK at least, bees (even domesticated or bred ones) are wild animals, and from a legal perspective the beekeeper is just maintaining a box on their land that honeybees just *happen* to inhabit. Beekeepers don't have any liability for what bees do\n Comment: Feels like a right of capture situation for pollen and nectar. The neighbor could get their own beehive and do what they want with the honey they produce.

This guy is an asshole though I can't even imagine suing someone because his bees are taking pollen from your flowers.\n Comment: What if he doesn't want his flowers to get pollinated?

They could be bees from a wild hive, or bees from an apiary a few blocks over.\n Comment: I agree that a court would view it as so de minimus that it can be dismissed on summary judgment. There is an element of “are you kidding me” that judges rightly bring into the courtroom in these cases. Don’t believe me? Remember the 90’s ad for “Pepsi points” that showed a kid getting a jacket for 100 points and the kid at the end getting a fighter jet for 700,000 points? A kid actually collected the points and sued Pepsi for not giving him a fighter. The court’s opinion essentially amounted to “it was a joke…duh.”\n\nTrespass does not require harm, but there is some reasonableness built into this. I could sue my neighbor for trespass if his toddler kicked their ball into my yard. If I somehow got it all the way to trial, the jury would likely find the plaintiff not liable. One of the jury’s functions is also to play a “are you kidding me” role. If it was before a judge, they might say “yes you are liable. Your damages amount to $1.” Damages of $1 has happened in cases where the plaintiff is technically right. But there are also mechanisms like sanctions that could get involved and penalize the plaintiff for things like “vexatious litigation” which is simply unnecessary litigation that is frivolous to the point of wasting resources and harassing the defendant. \n\nMy point is that there are a number of protections in place and lawyers (hopefully) have ethical, legal, moral, monetary, and reputational restraints that prevent them from filing most of these cases. A non-lawyer could do it, but they would either get sanctioned or screw up a procedural issue and get dismissed most likely.\n\nIf the plaintiff could truthfully say “my neighbor knows my child is deathly allergic to bees, his bees are super aggressive, and swarms of them come in clouds into my yard to the point that we can’t go outside” they may have an action for nuisance against the neighbor. It takes a lot more than a minor annoyance that might TECHNICALLY be a trespass.\n Comment: now THAT'S some good legal opinioning.\n Comment: >I think the neighbour asking the court to prevent bees from invading his yard is a fair request.\n\nIf the neighbor doesn't want bees in their property they need to get rid of the attractive nuisance (flowers) or take steps to block the bees from accessing said resource same as is required for pools and such.\n Comment: Poor Hector, not sure how he got tangled up in this mess...\n Comment: I think foreseeablity is going to be the limiting factor there. There's a case with a scale at a train station... I can't think of it right now, but I'll try to remember to look it up. Great example of unforeseeable harm.\n Comment: In that event it would be reasonable to assume that any bees would cause harm and not just those bees and in such a case the onus would be on flower owner to carry an epi-pen or take other measures to protect themselves from wild animals. These are bees. They're wild animals. Beekeepers just provide shelter in exchange for the biggest share of the honey, and that exchange is arguable, considering we usually need to smoke them until they're passive in order to collect said honey.\n Comment: You are actually correct. They usually forage in a radius between 1/4 mile and 3 miles away.\n Comment: Swing and a miss.\n Comment: *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*\n\nYour post or comment has been removed because it was primarily insulting or attacking someone else.

Native pollinators are also more efficient at pollinating native plants. European honeybees are considered livestock and continuing research suggests they negatively impact native bees, pollinators and potential environmental damage(which to be fair, seems like more of an issue of not planting more diverse species).  There’s even a ‘propaganda’ movement called ‘bee-washing’ over this. \n\nI don’t think this guy would have a case but as more research comes out it will be interesting to see what potential bee ‘leash laws’ could pop up in the future.

At least I get to smell the lovely food from downstairs while I eat my crappy food.\"  \n\nThe greedy shop owner demanded that the judge award him money from the poor man cause he \"enjoyed my food but didn't pay anything.\"\n\nSo the judge thought for a moment and asked the poor man if he had any coins on him.  The poor man reached into his pocket and pulled out some change; the judge then said take the coins and pour them from one hand to the other three times.  \n\nThe judge then told the shop keeper, \"He got the pleasure of smelling your food.  You got the pleasure of hearing the sound of his money.  The bill is paid and case dismissed.\"\n Comment: Beekeeper here. We actually *charge* for pollination services, if anything OP should expect an invoice, not a jar of honey.\n\nAlso bees forage up to 4-5 miles around their colony.  For a 4 mile radius, that's about 50 square miles, or 32,000 acres. How big is the neighbor's yard, 1/2 acre?  The neighbor's contribution is roughly 1/64,000 of the honey produced. Say the colony is a superstar that produces 100 lbs of honey a year. Neighbor's yard is responsible for 0.025 ounces of honey.\n Comment: Well, if they were intentionally propagating an heirloom plant then bees being in the area could cross pollinate in a way that ruins his variety.\n\nIn that case though, those plants would be in a greenhouse I'd think.\n Comment: I would too and what I would do is walk over, knock on their door, and see if they'll give me a discount on a jar or if I could help them in some way to get a jar.\n Comment: >If he didn't want bees in his yard trading nectar with flowers ror pollination then he would grow plants that don't flower.

If my dog goes into your yard, that is trespass. If I throw garbage over the fence into your yard, that is trespass. I think the only thing not considered trespass is gas (i.e. smoke from a bonfire). If I create an insect colony on my property and they go onto your property, that is trespass. They are *my* insects, and if they go on *your* property, it is *me* who trespasses. This might seem odd, but you have to remember that trespass of property is probably the oldest tort there is and is based on the absolute right of a property owner over their property. In classical liberal thought, property is the essence of individual liberty and is sacrosanct.\n\n> Also, how would the neighbor prove that the bees pollinating his flowers are from his neighbor's apiary? They could be bees from a wild hive, or bees from an apiary a few blocks over.\n\nThat's not entirely difficult. It only needs to be proved on a balance of probability. Think of it this way. How many other yards are swarmed with bees? Why is it that the only houses swarmed with bees are the ones *right next door* to the beekeeper? Why is it that whenever the beekeeper tends to the hive (and agitates the bees), the amount of bees in the neighbour's property increases. Why is it that the bees only appeared at the same time the neighbour build their aviary? This is a common sense deduction that a court would have no hard time coming up with. Now, if there was another apiary few blocks over, it would be harder to prove. But, that is a very specific set of facts. Any thing can be more or less likely depending on the facts. In short, the trespass is provable with common sense, if the facts allow.\n Comment: The whole \"bees may not come from his neighbor\" is a good point. Typically bees fly up from their hive and then fly a good distance outward before they start looking for flowers. If they didn't they would waste too much time trying to gather nectar from the few flowers that are close.\n Comment: Bingo. This is it right here.\n Comment: > honeybees are not native to the US and are not essential pollinators here to crops.\n\nThe first is true, but a \\*lot\\* of our crops are also not native, and thus, are best pollenated by the honeybee. \n\nBees native to the US tend to seek out native plants first, European bees tend to seek out the plants that they evolved with first. Both will sometimes pollenate the other as a secondary priority. Therefore, healthy populations of both are generally beneficial to each other and the environment as a whole, but neither directly replaces the other. \n\nI'm not a beekeeper yet, but I'm starting hives in the spring and have sat in on presentations for this by those who are.\n Comment: YES!!!!

It's not trespass of the person (unless the OP was stung) or of the goods, which leaves only trespass to the land:\n\n>Land is defined as the surface, subsoil, airspace and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses.\n\nFlowers would not be considered to be permanently attached to the land, so it would be impossible to argue trespass to the land (unless the bees marched single file down the neighbours garden path, of course).\n Comment: Not a trespass. (At least not in any American jurisdiction that I’m aware of). \n\nWhile a person can be sued for civil trespass when something other than their physical person intrudes upon another person’s property, the trespassing entity must be under some level of control and/or direction of the person. \n\nSending your dog onto neighbor’s lawn to poop? Could be a trespass. \n\nThrowing trash over the neighbor’s fence?

In a great many farms, the density of crops is simply more than wild pollinators can take care of.  So they augment this by renting bee hives from beekeepers.\n\nBut most tend to charge from $25-100+ per hive, depending on season.  And depending on the needs of their crop they will normally rent multiple hives.  But the general ratio is from what I remember up to a dozen hives per acre.\n Comment: You can actually buy \"mono-floral\" honey which has a huge variety of different flavors based on what the bees were primarily foraging. I've had mead made with lime blossom honey that was distinctly citrusy.\n Comment: >What happens if they encounter other bee, do they fight over pollen when they are so far away? Do they have \"territory?\"\n\nRobbing can happen, but that's more hive centric. If the hive looks undefended, and has honey, bees might just steal that. \n\nYou can definitely have multiple hives in the same area, though. Bees might even swap between hives, particularly if they are close together and the same color. This is sometimes undesirable, because pests like mites can be spread this way. \n\nHoney absolutely can get impacted by whatever is growing in a given area...even over the same season it can change, as flowers bloom.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Now I am getting property law PTSD flashbacks. The bees could be intruding on the airspace by flying to the flowers. I don't think the flowers are the issue as much as the owner has the right to reasonable enjoyment of their land. If the bees obstruct the reasonable enjoyment by being in the airspace, then it is a trespass. The especially the case if bees fly at low altitude. I know airspace is a mess if a concept, especially when it comes to extent of airspace, but think that if a person can walk into a bee while on their property, that bee has interfered with reasonable enjoyment. Also, there are a slew of cases which challenge that traditional definition of attachment and the difference between property and chattel. The permeance is helpful, but land can also include items that create the essential character of the property. For example, an industrial machine is not fixed, but may be property as it defines the property. There is one case (*La Salle.v. Camdex*) where the court ruled that a carpet was property and not chattel, even though the judge himself went to the hotel and lifted the carpet up.\n Comment: Double file is chill though 🙃\n Comment: > But unless they’re trained bees and the apiarist is intentionally sending the bees to steal neighbor’s pollen…not a trespass.\n\nIf you can train a bee to steal pollen, you truly are the greatest criminal alive\n\nEDIT to add NAL\n Comment: In *Moulson v Hejnar* from Alberta Canada, the King's Bench quotes a case from 1913:\n\n> In the language of Erle CJ, “The owner of an animal is answerable for any damage done by it, provided it be of such a nature as is likely to arise from such an animal, and the owner knows it… But if the horse does something that is quite contrary to its ordinary nature, something which the owner has no reason to expect he will do, he has the same sort of protection that the owner of a dog has.”  It is not in the ordinary course of things that a horse, not known to be vicious should kick a man. So far as a trespass is concerned, if a horse, pursuant to its natural instincts, eats a neighbour’s hay, or in any other respects indulges its ordinary natural instincts, the owner may be liable, but otherwise not.\n\nTo be fair, in *Moulson* the issue was a bull crossing property lines and injuring someone. I don't know if that is comparable enough to bees taken pollen. However, the common law does suggest that animal owners are responsible for the movements of their animals if such movement if reasonably foreseeable in accordance with the nature of the animal.\n\nSo, yeah, it could be viewed as common law trespass. Nuisance could also work. I was thinking Rylands and Fletcher, but there is no real damage to the land, and I don't think building an aviary would count as making a non-natural use of the land.\n Comment: That's exactly my thought too.\n Comment: Haha yeahhhh what can ya do. I didn't find it a massive loss at all. r/bestoflegaladvice  is funner anyways.\n Comment: It might be the same one that banned me for messaging and asking to do an interview.\n Comment: IT would be weird if he tested that out by also handing me a big jug of homemade vinegar.\n Comment: Interesting, thanks\n Comment: Just imagine, when driving down the highway in the right season, one of those tractor trailer trucks next to you might be filled with nothing but an unreasonably large quantity of bees.\n\nDrive carefully.\n Comment: Right but that's a paid gig bc it makes bigger/better drop yields. This person is upset that they're not getting something for free when they are. The bees are making their garden better by, being bees. Would this person just destroy the bees if they werent someone's property? Like, theres tons of issues. By this logic of paying for bees, this neighbor should be thankful theyve not received an invoice for services rendered on their garden. Lol\n Comment: Also, in the US most food plants are non-native, so their are few if any native polinators in the first place.  Honeybees are also non-native and can pollinate a wide variety of things.\n Comment: *Your post has been removed for the following reason(s):*\n\nStay out of Malibu Lebowski.\n\n\n\n*If you have questions about this removal, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLegalAdviceofftopic).

You own 100+ acres. Wild raccoons (or bears!) live on your property. Sometimes they forage for food in the neighbor’s garbage. Is that trespassing? Nope. (At least not in any jurisdiction I’m aware of). \n\nUsually, when I read those types of cases, there’s some level of domestication to win a claim for nominal damages. Or some level of real damages caused by a non-domesticated animal. (Admittedly, I’m only versed in American law and only know like two cases from England). \n\nSo I could envision a viable negligence lawsuit if you were raising bees and placing their hives at the far end of your property directly adjacent to your neighbors, knowing they had an allergy to bees, and the bee stings the neighbor. \n\nBut not a suit for trespass.\n Comment: Vinegar is pretty good.\n Comment: Shit, I’d almost prefer the vinegar\n Comment: \"More than 10 million bees released when semi-truck crashes on Utah highway\"\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/02/us/bees-utah-highway-crash-trnd/index.html\n Comment: Also, in regions with a huge monoculture industry (like the almonds mentioned above in California), there can be acres and acres of land with no other flowers for bees to forage but almonds - this is great when the almond trees are in flower, but the lack of pollen the whole rest of the year means that the bees would die off between seasons. Because there isn’t enough variety of plants in that region, many natural pollinators have died off and if they don’t pay beekeepers to being bees to the almond farms, they won’t get many almonds pollinated and won’t get much of a crop at all. It’s somewhat of a self-created problem.\n Comment: This thread led me to read about bee law in my area. \n\nThere are all sorts of codified regulations beekeepers have to abide by, from registering their hives with the system to placement of the hives on their property, setback laws, etc. \n\nAll that to say, I now know a guy on my block who has a hive is in violation of the city’s statutes as his hive is too close to a public thoroughfare! For shame!\n Comment: From *The Law of Torts in Canada, Fridman 1989 - Vol. 1, pp. 211-12:* (cited in *Laws v. Wright*)\n\n> 3) The Scienter Doctrine\n\n> (a) Common Law\n\n> (i) The Doctrine Stated\n\n> Where harm is caused by the behaviour of an animal, whether on the property of the defendant or elsewhere, this kind of liability depends upon the type of animal concerned. The law distinguishes between wild animals, i.e. animals *ferae naturae*; and tame or domestic animals, i.e. *animals mansuetae naturae* or *domitae naturae.* For damage resulting from the act of a wild animal, the defendant is strictly liable, without proof of negligence or other wrongful conduct, and without the necessity of proving that the defendant was aware of the dangerous character of the particular animal that caused the harm, or of the class of animals to which it belonged. If the animal is *mansuetae naturae,* that is, one which ordinarily did not cause the kind of harm that is involved, the common law requires that the particular animal concerned have the dangerous or mischievous propensity to commit the harm or damages that it inflicted, and that the defendant knew of such propensity or characteristic of the individual animal. To keep such an animal with knowledge of its potential for causing harm is not in itself negligence, or indeed wrongful in any other way (any more than to keep a wild animal is per se unlawful or negligent). Indeed, despite some judicial discussion that appears to introduce elements of negligence into liability for animals, at common law there is no need to prove negligence in the way in which the animal in question was controlled or kept in order to establish liability, as long as the requisite elements of dangerous propensity or character and knowledge are present.\n\nAre bees wild animals? If so and they are from your property and cause a harm, then you are strictly liable. Are bees domesticated? If so, then you are only liable if they have propensity to do the harm in question. Bees do indeed have a propensity to trespass to seek flowers, and so you are liable. The one that is not clear is if trespass on its own can be the harm the animals cause. Trespass is harm, otherwise it wouldn't be a tort, but is it the type of harm they include in animal handling? The law I cited certainly support your example with the bee sting, because a sting is harm, and bees have propensity to sting. However, does it go as far to include to trespass?\n\nThis is common law of course. Many places have wild animal livestock laws to either expand or restrict the common law.\n Comment: I don’t think you “own” wild animals that happen to naturally inhabit your property in the same way that you “own” domesticated animals/insects/whatever that you deliberately placed there.\n Comment: So the violation would be a criminal offense! (Even if the penalty is only a fine). \n\nBut the bees themselves? Couldn’t be a trespass\n Comment: I suppose there is an argument that building a beehive on your property and bees taking residence is a form of domestication. I don’t think there’s any case law that would support that argument but I’m not familiar with every state in america, much less other countries. Bees can take up residence anywhere. There’s nothing keeping them in your beehive. And regardless of where you build a beehive, you can’t actually train them to do anything. So I don’t think they would qualify as domesticated animals in any sense of the word. \n\nFor the same reasons, I also think it’s a weak argument that bees living on your property means that they’re *your* bees for which you can be held liable for their conduct. \n\nBut let’s assume that a court could find that you own the bees and that you could be held liable for their actions. And so you’re sued for strict liability in tort (which is not the same thing as suing for trespass). \n\nStrict liability requires damages (what you phrase more broadly as harm). Where there are no damages, there is no viable strict liability claim. \n\n“Damages” means that the harm can be reduced to a dollar figure. Dog bites someone? That person will have damages in the form of medical bills, potentially emotional distress. Domesticated bee that you have control over stings someone? Potentially a strict liability claim. \n\nBut where the “harm” is not a legal harm, there’s no claim of strict liability. \n\nTrespass is a tort that does not require proof of damages. If I step onto your lawn without permission, you have suffered no damages, but you still have a viable trespass claim. If you sue for damages, you would only be entitled to nominal damages (e.g., $1).\n\nBut you’re not going to be able to prevail on a trespass claim for the bees unless they are domesticated and somehow under your control when they are entering the neighbor’s property.\n Comment: Yeah, there's a good reason it's called beekeeping, not beetaming.  Bees are in no real sense domesticated.  We've simply learned how to keep their hive under our control.  No more.\n Comment: And if you fuck up, the bees can and will leave. \n\nSo, even the control is incredibly loose. You certainly can't train them in any real sense. There's better and worse ways to care for them, but they're wild in any sense that matters.",

The actual “Beekeeper” is a newer Jason Statham action movie that apparently has nothing to do with actual bees. The juxtaposition of the two is the joke here.\n Comment: I think they’re referring to the newer movie with Jason stathom called the Beekeeper\n Comment: In the best possible way\n Comment: Yeah but they were two different words, which makes it amazing actually in a way. Not even a Sabbath fan, but it’s a good analogy using the same word in two different ways.  That’s poetry.\n Comment: What do you mean, he kept those bees close for the rest of his life\n Comment: We're really poking the hive with this schtick\n Comment: Jesus Christ they didn’t have permission slips or anything!?!\n Comment: This went from dark to pitch black nightmare real quick.\n\nI'm so sorry you had to deal with that.\n Comment: It was a gut punch as a teenager, hell ity was a gutt punch unless you were a shriveled up husk in the ground.\n Comment: My favorite part was when he said \"It's beekeepin' time\" and proceeded to keep the bees.\n Comment: Fat Boerstard\n Comment: The part that bothers me the most and that I can't suspend my disbelief enough for is the Fat Bastard not shooting as he stands there barking that he'll shoot... for real! he's serious! don't underestimate him!!\n\nDude was in checkmate position but did the equivalent of allowing the king two free moves to get out of the checkmate.\n Comment: It's such a fucking awful movie, start to finish. And the ending.. just wandering out into the sea with scuba gear that he stashed.\n Comment: He was beating up bad guys and getting vengeance as violently as possible. It was a Jason statham action film, were you expecting Coen Brothers?\n Comment: No I think he’s a scientist, but had recently pivoted to try and catch ghosts\n Comment: He was trying to get the band back together.\n Comment: Middle aged then.\n Comment: Over 30 years old...\n Comment: A certain generation of kids that saw it had it stick with them. That's it doesn't have to be that deep. I was about the age of the kids in the movie when I saw it and I still occasionally think about the little girl crying at his open casket funeral because he's not wearing his glasses and he can't see without them.\n Comment: You're not alone\n Comment:  It was a childhood drama with a sudden gut wrenching ending that came out of nowhere. It actually traumatized kids that saw it, and obviously some here never got over it.\n Comment: They're just making a shock joke since the kid died by bee sting.\n Comment: He died from bees in the movie of my girl\n Comment: She only died on the inside\n Comment: You might be thinking of Bridge to Terabithia, the other traumatizing story about childhood friendship.\n Comment: Fuck I still don’t see why that’s funny\n Comment: Did I ask what the joke was?\n Comment: Thank you.\n Comment: This thread has me dying.... *of anaphylaxis*!\n Comment: Permission slips to watch a movie?

All these people are calling it a terrible movie, and I'm like \"it delivered exactly what it promised\".\n Comment: He hired me to drive his cranky mother around but money wasn’t worth it.\n Comment: That’s right, it’s the prequel to Ghostbusters.\n Comment: Was this in the Amazon?\n Comment: Damn… that stung more than the bees…\n Comment: Shut the actual fuck up.\n Comment: No that was another movie with him\n Comment: Like the Bridge to Terabithia?\n Comment: Right and for a lot of us that were around that 7-12 range we all wanted to see it because we all were huge fans of Home Alone so that was a real fucking gut punch.\n Comment: I saw it in theaters when I was around 12 years old. It traumatized me so much that I haven’t been able to watch it again since.\n Comment: That's awful. I'm glad I know now because my 6 year old daughter loves Home Alone and would probably want to see if it's on a streaming service.\n Comment: Edgy\n Comment: I guess I'll start calling Bubba in *Forrest Gump* \"Sergeant York\"...you know, because even though he wanted to be a shrimp boat captain, he was killed in action.\n Comment: It’s more shock value than anything. Like saying that the hardest part about breaking up with your Japanese girlfriend is having to drop the bomb on her twice before she actually gets it. It’s not that funny, just kinda jaw-dropping if you weren’t expecting it. It elicits an emotional response that many people try to cover over with laughter, and for many people that’s close enough to humor. I’m one of those people, apparently.\n Comment: Movies with child death?? Yes that’s sensitive content. Now if they were in high school maybe not but elementary schoolers? Absolutely\n Comment: Makes perfect sense, consent don’t matter over there lmao\n Comment: I heard there was a b plot where he sold really generic vodka in a skull shaped bottle.

WHYYYYYYYYYY\n Comment: Nay, like the never ending story.\n Comment: Do what thou wishes\n Comment: This was a 5th-6th grade combo class. I think they were trying to use a movie about death as an introduction for young pre-teen types, but that kind of \"introduction\" doesn't really work on kids who already experienced it in large part.\n Comment: Nah, it wasn't like that. I had similar reactions in public school dealing with teachers and adults in similar situations.\n\nOur understandings of trauma and issues are understood and handled way differently now.\n Comment: Rumor has it he was once called the king of auto parts. Heard he saved a factory in Sandusky, Ohio from going under\n Comment: Yeah that sounds shaky, I would be upset if my kids saw that and I wasn’t aware. Hopefully they sent a damn email or something😂😂\n Comment: Well how long ago was it lmao, cause the 90s were absolutely wild so you’re right\n Comment: Well, the movie had just come out on vhs, so it wasn't exactly an email type timeframe lol.\n Comment: I mean, the movie had first come out onto vhs when we saw it lol.\n Comment: The good ol days 🤣🤣\n Comment: They had to roll the tv into the classroom?😂",

Hmm...\n Comment: Why are you wearing protection and not the baby?\n Comment: r/facepalm\n Comment: good photoshop\n Comment: As a former beekeeper, this photo looks a little staged. No bees around or on hive, smoker has no smoke whatsoever coming out of it. You can work bees with no suits or vails at certain times of the year so this would be possible to do safely.\n  But I don't understand why the guy is suited up in a sheriff's suit (what we called them) and the baby has zero protection.\n Comment: God I hate April fools day.\n Comment: What a fucking idiot, dad of the year\n Comment: My dad had me on a back pack, but he also just wore a t-shirt and jeans.

Honestly more people need to be aware of just how serious they can be, even if you’re not allergic enough stings can be serious. Using a baby as a shield is actually a very clever way to make sure none get in your suit because if they do happen to attack the two of you all you have to do is toss the baby in the opposite direction and run. The crying will usually cause the bees to focus on the child and you can easily outrun them.\n Comment: Goddammit I’m so tired, and I’ve been bamboozled 4 times already\n Comment: God I hate April fools.\n Comment: Beekeeper training day, apparently.

He said they'll only sting you if you're afraid of them.\n Comment: It has been said!..moving forth for eternity. A bee never stingeth or otherwise fly in the face of thine babies, for he is defenseless to the stupidity of those who care for him.

Beekeeper here, a secret of our trade is the annual sacrificial offering of the firstborn to the bees.  If they are satisfied with your offering, they will be docile and productive for the next season.  \n\nMost beekeepers either feel great shame about this or fear legal repercussions and will refuse to confirm this truth.

What I do mind is people not knowing that some parts of the world do it differently.\n Comment: I rarely need to know the day before I know the month, so month goes first. If the month is assumable then you drop it altogether. If it's a context where the year is relevant and isn't just there for the off chance the document gets referenced in the far future then Y/M/D is the best format for the same reason.\n Comment: It’s not silly from a perspective of naming files in a business setting since it will group all the months together.

Not sure about in my home but I would love to have bees.\n Comment: Thaaaats a big ol’ nope from me\n Comment: What of all this makes you think \"great Idea\"?\n Comment: Death...uhhh finds a way - Goldblum probably\n Comment: So I absolutely love this as an idea! I run a teahouse and thought that this would be a perfect addition to the vibe, to show that we’re eco friendly and care about beings that aren’t just human, to give some safe and warm space to the most important species on the planet.. All the symbology aside, the installation was messed up just slightly and we got BEEs, tons of them inside the teahouse.\n\nLike I’m allergic to bees, but still know that they’re harmless assuming you’re not aggressive.  I was vacuuming them up all afternoon and people were freaking the fuck out.... all of them saying how they were concerned about people being allergic. And I’m like “hello! I’m allergic and I’m cleaning them up without fear”... who are you concerned about? \n\nOverall, it wasn’t good for business and we removed it the next day.\n\n5/10, would recommend if you like a lot of excitement in your life.\n Comment: Cue music: WHO LET THE BEES OUT\n Comment: A gigantic multi-hive version of this is a staple of the local state fair. Always thought if you were going to get into beekeeping, this would be the coolest way to do it.

Is this just for feeding?\n Comment: Cool idea, but there’s not very much space at all (unless it extends outwards) and uhh living creatures probably shouldn’t be treated as decor. Maybe that’s a personal opinion but who knows. Maybe give em a nice hive outside so they they have room to store honey.\n Comment: As a hobbyist beekeeper, I THINK this is a potentially bad idea for several reasons.\n\nA) Hive maintenance is a requirement to prevent your neighbors from being able to claim they are a \"nuisance\", and the city forcing you to get rid of them. If you do maintain it, then yes, as people have pointed out, you'll have a house full of bees.\n\nB) The warmth inside your house will pass to the bees, causing them to think it is warmer outside then necessary.\n\nC) Your warm air inside and the cold air coming in from outside may cause a condensation build up. Moisture is a HUGE problem for honeybees and their honey.\n\nD) Light affects bees similarly to point B. You'll have them flying out at night, unable to tell that it's dark and therefore cold.\n\nSimilar to tools like the Flow Hive, nothing can replace the knowledge of a trained Beek. I'd love to hear from other experienced beekeepers who have run experiments like this.\n Comment: Yeah until that glass breaks\n Comment: I’m allergic to bee stings.  This terrifies me.\n Comment: Somebody makes bee frames that drain their honey out, without the need to remove them.

Why do I find this so funny? I don’t remember the last time I laughed so hard and loud. Thanks.\n Comment: My dad is a beekeeper and we had one of these at our house growing up. They only got out twice. \n\nFirst time, the glass was not tight and the whole hive got out and was swarming. Most of the bees went to the windows and stayed there, but there were others flying around the room like crazy. Since my dad wasn’t home, my mom and I hid in her bedroom for awhile. \n\nThe second time, there was a hole in the tube leading outside. The bees somehow went up through the walls and started coming out the vents. That was interesting and horrifying.\n\nStill, it was really cool having and I would recommend.\n Comment: Agreed, I’m all for this if you tell me how I get the honey\n\nUnless the point is just to look at the bees and be grateful they are pollinating my garden.\n Comment: You do hive maintenance when it’s time to get rid of unwanted guests.  Worth it.\n Comment: Just tell them ahead of time to stay off the furniture and then open’r on up.\n Comment: Former bee keeper here. I would assume that you don't take the comb out. It's not for harvesting honey but rather just to see them living and doing their own thing. My problem is the size, it doesn't leave enough room for brood and honey storage, right? It only seems sustainable if this was a section of a larger hive that was mounted outside.\n\nHow do you service it? You don't practically, leave um bee.

For the most part, they nest in a consistent place, and typically pollinate and harvest nearby flowers for food. They may get into sugary foods, but if your consistent about cleaning up they wont be a bother. \n\nThe danger comes 2 places. 1st from their breeding, since new hives can be setup in inconvenient locations if your not particularly careful.\n\n2nd, if your harvesting their honey, your eating their food supply. This can lead to aggression (not that bees are particularly good at agression, it's kinda adorable actually) and eventually the collapse of the colony.\n Comment: An entire swarm of bees crawled through the little holes in the window frame and invaded my house a couple of months after I bought it.

How did they get a tube through the glass window? Is it in the frame? Me, I would thought it was easier to just drill a hole through the wall.

I remember once someone posted in the internal classifieds at my job that they had a hive in the wall of an old barn they were tearing down and wanted to know if anyone could move the hive, as they didn’t want to kill the good bees.  Someone did come and get the hive and moved it to a much more stable location in hive boxes elsewhere for free!\n Comment: Another protip: do not ever PAY a beekeeper to come and collect bees from your property. I have seen ads on Facebook of beekeepers who will remove a swarm for $50, and there’s is a local guy where I live who will take care of that hive near your house for $25. Honey bees are incredibly expensive and beekeepers can sell an established hive or a swarm of bees for sometimes hundreds of dollars, or keep them for themselves and save a ton of money from having to buy a nuc or package of them. If you pay them for it, you’re basically paying them to make even more money. \n\nTherefore if a beekeeper ever tries to charge you, kindly let them know you’ll find somebody else, as many would be glad to take them off your hands. \n\nOverall it’s a pretty even exchange: they provide you the service, work, equipment and expertise. \n\nAnd you provide them with hundreds of dollars worth of bees.\n\nEdit: Source- I’m a beekeeper\n Comment: Maybe the bees get paid and they're professionals so they know how to behave?

I live in Illinois and was hoping I would never have to deal with them.

I'll crossbreed them so we get docile, non-venemous, bees!\"\n\nBecause that's clearly how it would work. Ah well, you know what they say: 'The road to hell-bees is paved with good intentions.'\n Comment: Bees like to buzz around your head to let you know you're being a jerk. They really don't like me picking all the weeds this time of the year. After a bit of picking there will always be one that lets me know I'm a jerk so I head to the other side of the yard and keep picking until another one lets me know I'm a jerk and back to the other side I go. Rinse and repeat all afternoon.\n Comment: The one time I was stung by a bee was when one landed on my shirt and I brushed it off without looking. It was up by my shoulder and out of my full vision, so I didn’t realize what it was. It’s possible I brushed my hand into its stinger, if that can happen.\n Comment: Dammit.

They will almost never attack unless you threaten the hive or the queen. If the hive breaks, you’re more likely to get stung if you try to fix it than if you just calmly leave the house and call a specialist. \n\nMy dad raised bees on our property for my entire upbringing and they truly are gentle creatures. I’d regularly find them in my room and you can push them onto your finger and they’ll just chill there until you get them back outside. Wasps give them a bad name.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Tons of people have fish tanks in their houses without any accidents, a bee hive is likely to be even less accident prone.\n Comment: Not sure what accident could occur.

No idea how to get the honey out though.\n\nEdit. [You can remove the back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQcwjTGdMo) and then there's something called called \"top bar style frames\" that you can take out. That sounds like a beekeeping word so it might be the answer here. But if you have it in your house then your house will be full of bees. And on other videos it seems like the bees will also build combs on the glass, which presumably means those can't be removed so easily.\n Comment: We keep them under the shed.

They fuckin LOVE powdered sugar but it kills em, like a cocaine overdose or something. Even when they were spazzing out from the sugar high, crashing into fucking everything, they never stung me. They'd land on my bare arms, lick (or whatever bees do) the sugar off, and continue about their fatal business.\n\nAlso, if you're eating funnel cakes at a fair and there's bees in your area, you're 100% eating parts. They would fall into the oil constantly and kinda pop like corn does, and when there's a ton of customers there just isn't time to get all the parts out.\n Comment: I'd love to see a picture of this.\n Comment: Have you kept bees? Because they’re super smart and will fill every nook and cranny of anything they inhabit with propilos. That means any system you’ve had in place to contain them in that tube or box gets caked it brittle cement like propilos and any quick and easy movable part now has to be jerked about and piss all those bees off\n\nHive tools are mini crowbars for a reason, cause you need to pry the boxes apart to check on them and perform general maintenance like removing hive beetles and other pests, segregating the queen if you plan on harvesting any honey, and providing any extra food or insulation needed for a young hive in the winter. \n\nWether harvesting honey or not, at some point you’re gonna have to open, or move that box and unless you plan on smoking your whole house or just living in a bee suit you’re gonna have a bad time.\n\nAlso bees in walls are a very real thing and getting them out gets really expensive really quick not to mention the cost to repair your house once they’re gone\n\nI love my bees but they’ll never be in my house\n Comment: You clearly don’t have kids.

It will explode.\n\n Most glass these days is tempered for strength and safety. Codes vary but in general any window pane over 9 square feet or more and/or 18 inches from ground level.... or if it is an opperating window/door... or it is near a stair case... I mean the list goes on... has to be tempered. \n\nAlso, if it is dual paned or more... you just lost all your insulation, voided your warranty, and made a stupid as fuck hole in your window.\n\n\nJust don't. \n\nYes, you can cut glass. But if you didn't know about tempered glass or double paned glass before you read this... you sure as fuck shouldn't be cutting your window.\n Comment: Do people not know that you can cut glass or something? Because that is what I figured they did. Just cut a hole in the window and set the tube through with a rubber grommet. Probably only take 10 minutes to install.\n Comment: Ha!

I then just cut a small hole in the fly screen and they come and go as they please.\n\nMaintenance is a pain though.  I have to close up the entrance and take the whole hive outside, do the maintenance outside and then bring it back in.  I initially had a honey super on top (its in the first pic) but it just made it too heavy and unweildy.  So now I do splits and take half the frames away when the hive gets full.\n Comment: you clearly have kids\n Comment: So another reason to not have children...say no more.\n Comment: Lol don’t have your kids kicking soccer balls in the house maybe?\n Comment: These people don't have kids.

I'll just poke a bunch of tiny bee breathing holes in a ziploc bag and toss in some flowers or something. Bees eat flowers right?\n Comment: I look at some photos and went to the web site that makes these and the only thing i will need that is bee specific is some way to keep the queen from flying off. The web site has the things called rails, i think, that allow the worker bees in and out but the queen is to big. I just need to figure that out. I have the lumber already and glass is cheap. Ill make sure to use some really good adhesive on all the joints and to join the glass.\n Comment: just bones now\n Comment: How much did you smoke?\n Comment: nah i get chu, i did that earlier and had to double take to make sure i wasn't making a mistake, mistakenly thinking i made a mistake when no mistake was made. i should also go to bed.\n Comment: Touché\n Comment: It sounds like an odd investment at first, but they say the turnaround is great.\n Comment: [It's happened before](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/10/09/insane-discovery-30000-bees-and-40-pounds-of-honey-inside-the-walls-of-a-house/)\n Comment: That’s why I’m cutting up someone else’s window first!\n Comment: I don’t mean to speak for all people or anything... but I will anyway: no we didn’t know that.\n Comment: Uh, so the Simpson’s episode “Burn’s Heir” aired April 14th, 1994, in which this quote appears.\n\nMagic the gathering was created in 1993.

The only thing I'm certain of is that he's a very good boy.\n Comment: You can do that in o chem?\n\nI know it as the widowmaker of science classes, but now I really want to take it.\n Comment: Not as much as you think. I have to invest in equipment to house them, determine if the queen is worth keeping, spend a day and well past sunset collecting them. Most swarms are too small to survive, the workers only live a few weeks in the summer, so there's several day methods of combining smaller swarms into a viable population. There is no extra honey the first year. With the cost of time and equipment, I was making just a couple bucks an hour. I live in the city, so there's a limit to how many hives I can have, so I had to sell extras quickly to avoid complaints from neighbors.\n Comment: I’ll take your entire stock\n\n..\n..\n..\nThen I’ll sell it for $37 a tube\n Comment: Yes and it was horrible.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: And when the cops came thru me and Dre stood next to a smoked-out hive\n Comment: \n\n#Amen, brother!\n Comment: The depths of reddit are truly unfuckingimaginable\n Comment: i wish parents were more humble as if they weren't the first to ever raise children.

Cuz it's not like it's an actual hivemind (lol!) right, so do the workers or whatever actually care if they start 'serving' another queen? Or do you write off the whole colony(?) if the queen's no good?\n\nSorry for the questions, just always been interested in bees and that piqued my interest! :)\n Comment: What criteria do you use to evaluate the Queen?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: *Hidden gem\n Comment: With special appearance from Buzz Aldrin\n Comment: Queen LaBeefah is such a good name for a sandwich\n Comment: Except a career in a challenging field requires training and intelligence.

My first beekeeping experience was with an observation hive. There are a couple of problems with them. One is that they tend to not be expandable (as in, you can't add more frames as the bee population  expands) so they are very prone to swarming. That's fine if you are prepared to either catch the swarm or split the hive before that happens, but it is a problem. Another is that it's difficult to get into them to do checks or treat them for things like mites or disease. I had a hell of a time trying to treat my observation hive for mites and never quite managed it to a good effect. Finally, keeping bees inside a house in places where bees are used to a cold winter is difficult because they never really go into a true winter status, it's not cold enough in a house, so they continue to use their resources during the winter, but then cannot go outside to defecate, and/or they don't really get that it's winter, try to go outside and freeze. I know there are people who manage to keep up observation hives and have success with them, but it's a difficult type of beekeeping that has few upsides aside from being able to see what's happening in the hive all the time, which is definitely very cool. I love the concept, and I loved being able to watch them, but I lost a number of hives bc of the issues listed above.\n\nEdited to add: Wow! Thanks for all the awards everyone! It's always so awesome to me to see how interested in bees so many people are and how much so many people want to do their part to help them out. Just a reminder to also care about other native bees and if you can't set up a Beehive of your own, you likely can put up a little bee house for Mason bees and other, less well known native species! ❤️🐝❤️🐝❤️\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: This is awesome...... for someone else’s home\n Comment: Terrifying..\n\nMy cat would try to play with the bees, broken glass and chaos would most certainly result.\n\nKinda cool though!\n Comment: r/whatcouldgowrong\n Comment: Our Whole Foods does this and it is so awesome to look at.\n Comment: Break glass in case of a home invasion.\n Comment: Two words: Jurassic Park\n Comment: I saw the same type of set-up at a children's museum as a child.

You’ll put the side that would, in a normal application, face outside to the inside of the hive reflecting infrared energy back onto the colony. Evolutionarily speaking hives have evolved in darkness so think about adding a level of tinting as external light can be disruptive to bees that have not yet become phototactic. At the very least keep the viewing window covered.

Maybe a shed will keep them out.\n Comment: Awww this is awesome!

There isn't even enough room for the bees to store the amount of food needed just for them to get through winter. Which explains the sugar water feeder on top. Many observation hives need to be restarted in the spring because the colony just isn't big or strong enough to get through the winter. Or sometimes they will leave to find larger accommodations.\n\nAlso because of the lack of visible frames, I have to assume the bees will create the comb similar to how they would in a top bar hive. \n\nGenerally observation hives are mobile, so to open and check them you just seal the entrance tube and take the whole unit outside.\n Comment: How would you do anything to maintain it? Where is the brood chamber? What is the jar on top? Some type of sugar-water feeder maybe? If so that opens up even more questions like how and when the bees can access it. Many unaddressed problems here.\n Comment: Would also like to know\n Comment: Two possibilities.\n\nThe honey is in the jar at the top. There aren't any honeycombs in the \"hive\" so that leaves the jar as the only place for it to be. \n\nOR\n\nThe jar is just some kind of nectar that's used to just attract bee's into the case and they don't stay there permanently. They have a hive nearby and just come here for the easy constant supply of nectar.\n\nI'd guess the second option. Again, just guessing based on the picture.\n Comment: The tube could be connected to a hive outdoors maybe\n Comment: [The product in the picture can be seen here. ](https://beecosystem.buzz/)\n\nIt's a modular system and pictures of the larger system shows combs.

I would never try to dissuade someone from keeping bees because it can be very rewarding and enjoyable, but an observation hive takes a different sort of care and is really not the best way to learn how to keep bees. The observation hive at my job was my first experience keeping bees and it was very challenging and heartbreaking a lot of the time.

The only issue I could see with putting a box hive in a shed like that is lack of sunlight to warm the hive and let them know it's morning. But if you have a window or something that lets some light and heat thru in the summer that could work. I'd try to make sure that you give them several ventilation spots (like hive shims in between the boxes - they have a small gap in one side that allows air/bees to get thru) if the shed tends to get hot in the summer, or leave the door open during the day and close it at night when the bees aren't flying anyway and the likelihood of bears increases. Another issue that might be a little problematic is when you want to open the hive to do a check or treatment, the shed could get very full of bees that are a bit upset. The observation hive we had could be taken off the wall and carried outside, which is how I used to open it to do checks, but one time we forgot to close off the entrance tube and the room in the museum got full of bees trying to return to the hive 😬. It was not great. But I definitely understand having issues with bears, this never happened to my hive (I later had a true outdoor box hive) but it's happened to many of my beekeeping friends and it's fucking devastating.\n Comment: Look up \"AZ hives\" or \"Slovenian hives\". Basically exactly what you are talking about but has been around for ages. A hive where the entrance is built into the outer wall of a shed. You can access the frames from the rear side by pulling them out like books on a shelf, from the inside of the shed. It is common to have a dozen or so hives next to eachother spanning the wall. A small window in the shed lets any stragglers get back outside during inspections.\n Comment: If you're truly interested in setting up a hive, I would contact the local beekeepers association. Almost every area has one and they usually offer informational courses or have someone that will be willing to chat with you about the best way to go about it. And yes, make sure that it's okay in your neighborhood, at least as far as any HOA rules or whatever. I kept an outdoor hive at a Nature Museum that had kids running around all the time and I never had any visitor to the museum get stung. (I got stung, but that's bc I was the keeper!) And I have a friend who put up hives at another museum (an outdoor sculpture park) and he never had anyone get stung either. So it's not so much that a hive of bees necessarily means that neighbors will get stung just by virtue of them being there, but if ppl use certain fertilizers or pesticides nearby, it might not be great for bees.\n Comment: Yup. Everybody poops. If you happen to have a lot of bees around you, especially carpenter bees (the ones that are big and drill into the wood in people's houses) you'll sometimes see the poop splattered on your windows or car. It's yellowish brown and tends to be *very* hard to get off once it's dry. Like cement. 💩\n Comment: What I did after a couple of years of them dying over the winter indoors was work with a beek friend to move the observation hive frames to an outdoor hive for the winter, but due to some other factors that summer (very dry, not a lot of nectar for them to collect) they went into the winter pretty weak, despite feeding before I closed them up for the winter and giving them a candy board etc. they didn't make it. Though perhaps if I had gone thru the whole year planning to move them outside for the winter, I would've been better prepared. Every year and every failure is a learning experience, fortunately or unfortunately. And I was fairly lucky in that my observation hive had 8 frames to start with, so they did have some resources stored. The one in this picture only seems to have 2 frames (unless there's a box with more frames sticking out the back of the wall)  and that is just a recipe for failure. I suspect the picture was taken just after they put those bees in there - the comb isn't even drawn (doesn't have any wax cells built on for the bees to use for brood or storage)! The short answer is I don't know what a good plan is, I could never get it to work well, even though I know of at least 2 places with observation hives where they don't do anything special and they survived and did well! We're in such a strange period of time and climate weirdness and disease and parasites and fertilizers and pesticides that it could literally be 100 things that kill your bees, or somehow they survive against the odds. It's not a hobby for the faint of heart, unfortunately. 🙁\n Comment: When a hive doesn't have enough space to expand, they'll make another queen and the original queen will leave with a bunch of bees to build a new hive somewhere else. Swarms can be good because they allow bees to expand out into the area, but I had the experience a couple of times where my observation hive bees would swarm in like September, meaning that the bees that left would have to build a whole new hive AND have the queen lay enough bees to take care of her during the winter AND gather enough food to keep them alive for the winter, and that's nearly impossible. Some beekeepers are able to catch swarms or notice that it's about to happen and split the hive before they leave, but sometimes they just swarm and you have no idea where they went to and then they're just on their own. Edit to add that this is a *very* basic description of a swarm. There are many reasons why a hive will swarm, but in the case of an observation hive, it's almost always bc they run out of room.\n Comment: Well, the point of the observation hive is to have them in a place where you can see them and that's generally indoors. If you're going to set up a hive outdoors, you're better off just using a regular box hive. Most observation hives are larger than the one pictured up above, they generally have about 8 frames, stacked with 2 frames together. The one I had had large glass panes on both sides (which was a huge pain (haha) to open because I had to open the whole side of the hive to get into it sort of like this one. https://www.google.com/search?q=observation+hive&oq=observation+hive&aqs=chrome..69i57.5635j0j4&client=ms-android-att-us-revc&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#imgrc=3dg7nG-yxJBMZM&scso=_RKhbYLIQqYiCB8fuo8gL3:2762\nExcept ours had a hinge on top and bottom so that it could be mounted to the wall and turned. I ended up putting hinges on the glass panes to make it slightly easier to open and close, but I always ended up squishing a bunch of bees no matter how careful I was.  The main issue is space for the bees or being prepared for swarms and the inability to easily access it. You need to be able to take it outside to work the bees, otherwise you just get a room full of bees! Another issue is with installation of the bees into the hive. Whenever you're moving a hive around or putting frames into a new hive, the bees that fly out when you open the hive will mark the location of the hive with scent so that the other bees in the hive can find it. Except when you're putting the bees into the hive outside and then bringing the hive inside, it makes it difficult for the bees that are out flying around to find where the entrance to the indoor hive is, usually a little hole in the wall or by a window. A lot of them will go to the place where their sisters marked as \"home\" and that's not usually where the main hive ends up or where the entrance is. I tried to mitigate this by bringing the hive down near the entrance to the hive (a small hole in the wall) and installing them there, but since the hive was setup on the second floor of the building, the entrance hole was nowhere near where I was actually putting the bees in, so I would inevitably lose some bees just from that. If you're setting up a new hive, you can afford to lose a few bees, but you want to try to keep as many of them going to the right place as possible. I'm sure there are all manner of websites by hobbyists who have set up observation hives and have answers for most of these problems, but I first set up that hive about 9 years ago and observation hives weren't as much of a thing back then. Now there are all manner of observation hives and people also make their own. There are even some that are sort of half and half, where the top part is glass, but there's a traditional box hive base, which might work a bit better, but that seems more like something  you'd keep outside, and then you have to figure out how to insulate it over the winter etc etc. I don't know if I'd recommend it as a first time beekeeping experience, it's challenging. It's definitely very cool to be able to see what they're doing in the hive all the time, but I'd say it's more of a medium skill level project. And in my experience, if bees can figure out a way to die, they'll do it. (just kidding, but maybe not 😑) The picture up top seems to be a very poorly thought out hive and I'd be very surprised to hear that many bees were living in it in a year.\n Comment: Oh certainly. There are many better examples of observation hives, and I'm guessing there are many websites of people who have set up successful ones, or built their own. The one in that picture is really not a good one. From what I can see it only has 2 frames and the comb isn't even drawn out (not built up with wax made into cells for the queen to lay eggs in or the workers to store pollen or nectar) which leads me to believe that they just put those bees in there right before they took the picture. I'd be surprised if in a year there are still bees in it. It may be that there's a larger box with other frames sticking out the back of the wall, but from that picture, it's not a workable hive and you'd be better off just putting up a picture of a hive! It's just not a good example at all and was likely just something that was put into a magazine. Sadly for the bees. Or hopefully they put them into the hive for the picture and then took them right out again after the picture.\n Comment: Generally bees forage pretty far out during the busy spring and summer times, like around 2-3 miles sometimes, so you'd definitely want to have them be able to leave the greenhouse in the active season, unless you have a crazy amount of flowers constantly blooming, which is tough. If you mean keeping them in a greenhouse without like a hive around them, they do need a space to build comb. The \"honeycomb\" is not just where they put honey; the p0queen lays eggs in the cells of the comb, the bees store pollen in them, and yes, they put honey in there. Bees will build comb in all manner of places, evident if you've ever seen any videos of keepers removing swarms and hives from ppls houses. Wild bees will build hives in dead trees, under shed floors, in the roofs or spaces in people's attics etc. But if you're trying to raise bees, you'll want them to be contained in one place or in frames so that it's easier to take care of them and assess them. And also to collect honey of that's what you want to do.\n Comment: Bathroom art in that case.

When she lays unfertilized eggs, they develop into the drones that serve to spread the colony's genetics.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the presence of developing brood in the colony produces a pheromone that suppresses the ovaries of female worker bees.  If something ever happens to the queen, the workers will usually attempt to rear a new queen.  If for any reason they cannot do so, the absence of that brood pheromone will allow their ovaries to begin producing and the workers will start to lay eggs.  Because they're unfertilized, all these eggs will develop into drones.\n\nAt this point, the existing colony of bees will die...but those drones will seek out other virgin queens, keeping the colony's genetics alive.\n Comment: Oh that's too bad! I found the idea of indoors bee hive charming (with double casing though). But if it's not a sustainable structure, I will stick to support local apicultors.\n Comment: Thank you for that! Very interesting.\n Comment: Looks like this is just one frame of the hive, not that it's small.\n Comment: That's what I was saying. I don't think it's for the purpose of getting honey and they're treating it like an ant farm. I think we're looking at the brood chamber and the honeycomb isn't visible. Just my guess, anyway. Regardless, I assume this would be a bitch to manage.\n Comment: Bees don't actually store honey in jars.\n Comment: Clearly the jar is full of diluted Crown Royal. It keeps the bees calm.\n Comment: I think the jar is just display. Maybe they aren’t honey bees at all. I have many questions.\n Comment: Except bees don't just deposit honey into a jar... above their hive. They put it in a comb separate from the brood. The jar is just for display, or it's something else entirely. And I'm guessing there's a separate section for the honeycomb that isn't visible. This is an interesting setup.. I'm curious if they're even trying to get honey out of it because it's pretty small and looks like a bitch to manage.\n Comment: bees naturally produce wax and will build their own honeycombs\n Comment: That's the only way it could work, even opening that a little would just fill your house with bees.\n Comment: Apparently they are “closed for business”.

Yeah I wouldn't want to put them in a bad spot. I live in Arizona and we have a lot of farms around where I live and I see bee boxes out by the crops a lot. I've always wanted to setup my own hive, but I'd want to do it proper. Do you have a recommendation for someone who would want to setup something in their backyard? I'm not trying to turn into a honey making operation. I just love bees. I'd love to teach my son about this too.\n\nEdit: I should say I'm not going out tomorrow and buying what you recommend. I've got severe paranoia with failing at things so I will study for months and learn as much as I can before ever buying a single thing. Like my current hobby, growing weed. I studied and learned for 6 months before I ever planted a seed in the ground because I didn't want to fail. So if you have any links to resources to learn about bee keeping that you recommend, I'm all ears.\n Comment: > I would never try to dissuade someone from keeping bees\n\nI have. When the flow hive first hit, everyone wanted to be a beekeeper because they could harvest the honey without working the bees. If you want to be a beekeeper, you have to work the bees. If you are not willing to do that, then I will try to talk you out of it. I dont want a neighbor's bees getting sick and spreading it to my hives because they are fascinated with the novelty of the flow hive or an indoor observation hive. Between wax moths, hive beetles, varrora mites, trach mites, and everything else trying to destroy the hive or its resources, I don't need an irresponsible beekeeper added to the mix. \n\nOf course, if someone is truly interested, I will be glad to show them what it takes and support them.\n Comment: The observation hive sounds like more a retirement thing after a career of beekeeping.\n Comment: I mean my wife might not appreciate it 🤷‍♂️😂.\n Comment: Mam this is a honey digger post. The gold digger post's are across the aisle.\n Comment: I don't think most people keep observation hive for honey (we certainly didn't, I had one at my job which was a nature center and it was for education,) that jar on top of the hive in the picture looks like sugar water to feed the bees because yet another disadvantage to observation hives is that the bees don't have a lot of space on the frames to make or store honey or pollen, so they generally need to be fed all the time. Honey is cheap enough at the store to make beekeeping a *very* expensive way to get honey! 😉\n Comment: Why would you even want them to make honey in the winter? Can't you just get a few more normal hives and stockpile enough to last you all year?\n Comment: My shed does have vents and skylights, so temperature isnt a problem. Opening the hives inside, I would leave the door open for a while so they could sort themselves out. I could put a window into the top of the hive so they would see sunlight not just through their access port but through the skylight. Im still looking into it, there's some bee sheds that are built just for severe weather, Im researching what features they have and seeing if converting this shed is worth it. I live in the mountains, so when the weather is nice,its very nice, but when its bad it can destroy most everything. My losses have been too high to continue much longer, Im looking for a way to keep more colonies year after year and stop feeding the bears. There is nothing salvageable after a bear finds your apiary.\n Comment: Thats exactly what Im thinking of setting up. Basically a through the wall base board with supers set on top of that. When I do get honey, its fantastic from the mountain flowers. But when I lose a thousand dollars of equipment to one oversized rodent,I can't  justify setting up again without a more robust defense.\n Comment: Thanks!\n\nThat filled in some gaps in my knowledge\n Comment: That sound amazing, at this time I live in an apartment so it's not possible but this post reminded of a thought I had a while ago, when the Sherlock show Elementary started I did research and found next to nothing as far as information was available so I gave up on it. \n\nAs for the outside idea I was thinking if you spend a lot of time on your balcony (more 2nd floor of a house balcony), patio, veranda or gazebo, it still might be cool to be able to sit there and observe them.\n\nI've also thought up some crazy ideas about \"overcoming\" some of the issues you mentioned so if I ever do get a chance I might try after getting more informed. \n\nThaks for the insight.\n\n[I hit the submit button on my phone before I was done]\n Comment: I'm imagining flipping a timer when you shut the bathroom door.

Possibly by moving the whole hive? I'm not sure.\n Comment: I'm aware bees don't deposit honey into jars. Which is why I said the second option is more likely than a jar having an intake for the bees. \n\nAre you people not reading today or what?\n Comment: Yes I know, that's why I said there aren't any honeycombs in this \"hive\".

That's a great place to start, and as I'm sure you can guess by my wordy replies (lol) beekeepers are always happy to help new people get into the hobby, and generally want to impart good information on good techniques and things to watch out for that are specific to your area. I'm in NY, so I'd imagine beekeeping is a little different in AZ, the existence of winter for example! 😉\n Comment: So many moons ago, a plane hauling pot from mexico crashed in Arizona (or maybe they jettisoned the cargo? Been a while since I read about this). To this day you can still find random pot plants that sprouted from the seeds.\n\n\nNot really relevant but it amuses me and I like to share it whenever I can.\n Comment: OK, agreed. It's funny because my mother in law is being extremely kind in letting me setup hives in her backyard and she was really trying to talk me into a Flow hive and I said absolutely not, especially with my experiences with an observation hive that was extremely difficult to get into and nearly impossible to treat for mites or anything else. I will stick with the methods that beekeepers have been using for hundreds of years. I'm betting the picture at the top of this post was taken just after the bees were installed in there, it doesn't even look like the comb is drawn at all. I'd be very interested to see a picture of that hive a year later...\n Comment: Yes. One thing that annoys me now, knowing all I know about how difficult they can be is the kind of cavalier attitude some places seem to have about setting one up, without having an experienced beekeeper to actually take care of it. At my old job, the woman who put it in had been keeping bees on her own for years, but I think even she was surprised at how challenging it was and then she retired and it was left to me. I got laid off from my job during the pandemic and I'm really hoping they're not going to try to set it up again, bc nobody there has any idea of how to proceed. They barely know how to keep a regular outdoor hive.\n Comment: That isnt a no\n Comment: Also any beekeeper with an ounce of knowledge wouldn't expect to get honey year-round. There's zero nectar flow in the winter (for obvious reasons) so there's no expectation that a hive will manage to create more honey between fall and spring.\n Comment: Oh got it, thanks for the clarification!!  Also I didn't mean it to be a dig at you, in fact I appreciate your info enlightening us of the issues with this hive. 🤓👍\n\nIt just reminded me of these popular hives called Flow Hives, which give you the ability to have honey drip straight into a jar. They claim theres minimal disturbance to the bees but I've heard apiarists say they really dislike this setup because it absolutely does disturb them and is a very unnatural way for bees to live/work.\n Comment: Our best luck with combatting bears has been a rudimentary electric fence and heavy-duty ratchet straps to strap the hives down to a solid wood foundation. We have 10 hives and haven't lost one since installing those, whereas beforehand we lost one or two a year.\n Comment: That does sound like you could make it work, and some of the comments have good suggestions. I was fortunate with my outdoor hive bc while there definitely were bears around, I was able to bolt the outdoor hive on a concrete slab that was there already and then use ratchet straps to hold it shut. Maybe it was bc it was very close to the oil tank for the heating system and it messed up the bears' ability to smell the honey, but I never had a problem with them going after the bees, even though they would go thru the garbage and tear down the bird feeders. I wish you luck on setting up a system. Damn bears and their good memory! I'm sure it's the same bear, pleased every year that you've set up the honey bar for him again! 😡\n Comment: Right, same idea, but frames pull out horizontally from the back. Stacking langstroth style supers directly against the wall is kinda of a pain from a logistics standpoint.\n Comment: You might be able to keep a hive on a balcony or patio, as long as there is enough plants and flowers around the town/city for them to forage in and you'd be willing to feed them in the lean times. I know for sure that in NYC (mostly Brooklyn/Bronx) there are people who keep hives on the roofs of their buildings.\n Comment: Make it an actual shark tank and the marketing does itself\n Comment: They should’ve told them there was gold in the middle.\n Comment: Big, BIG swirly air.\n Comment: That pretty much happened, multiple times, with Hurricanes.\n\nThe Taino: yo there's a hurricane coming, we can see all the birds fleeing, we're gonna head inland the the mountains\n\nEuropeans: LOL silly superstitious savages, God will protect us\n\nHurricane comes and kills a lot of people.\n Comment: I am so sorry to hear that!

Arizona is starting to seem like a great place 😜\n\nhttps://www.kold.com/story/30134657/bundle-of-marijuana-falls-through-roof-of-nogales-home/\n Comment: Yeah, that looks like it has 2 top bar frames and doesn't even have any foundation. Those bees are so pissed. It'll be a couple of weeks before the queen could even start laying. I would be surprised if they don't abandon pretty quick.\n Comment: The mention of how long people have been keeping bees the same way instantly made me think of Amos I. Root, arguably the founder of the modern beekeeping industry.  \n\nAlthough that's mostly because he's from my hometown, the company he founded is still here, one of the middle schools is named after him, and our high school sports teams are the Bees.\n Comment: definitely not a \"hard no\"\n Comment: Yeah, I've looked at those hives, and I'm not convinced. My mother-in-law is being kind enough to let me set up beehives in her yard (I rent and our landlord would likely lose her mind at the thought of bees being around 🙄) and she was trying to convince me to try the Flow hive, but this is where having some experience with beekeeping in \"non-traditional\" hives like an observation hive really helped, because I don't see how getting into one of those Flow hives would be at all easy, and you *do* need to get into them, not just to collect honey, but to treat them for parasites or diseases, to check on your queen and her brood production etc, etc. I have only ever kept 2 hives at a time, so I'm definitely not an expert or anything, but those gimmicky hives seem to be for people with more money than sense (as a commenter above said) and not for people who really just want to keep bees for the enjoyment or even to harvest honey at the end. I've never harvested honey from my bees, aside from licking my fingers - the observation hive only allowed them to store a small amount and my outdoor hive also didn't have a lot in reserve much of the time. You have to leave a proportion of the honey they make for them to eat over the winter when there arent any flowers blooming. So yeah, I'm going with the setup that beekeepers have used for hundreds of years rather than some new fad! 😊 Edit to add: I bet this picture in the OP was taken right after installing those bees in there (it doesn't look like the comb is even drawn) but if you had a picture of that hive a year later, idk if there would be that many bees in there.\n Comment: The big problem with the Flow Hives is that they encourage people to leave the bees alone.  40 years ago that \\*might\\* have been defensible but in 2021 there are parasite and disease issues that will find your bees no matter where you live in the world.  **If you don't actively take care of your bees, inspecting the hives, treating for parasites & disease (mostly parasite) your hives have a lifespan of about 18 months**.\n\nSo flow hives might pour honey into a bottle, right until you ignore the bees and they all die.  It's fairly terrible to buy living things just to kill them with neglect.  It solves a problem responsible beekeepers don't have.  We don't mind putting our hands in the box of bees. So we can care for them.  So something that makes it harder to take care of bees so we don't have to put our hands in there isn't interesting to us.\n Comment: I had an electric fence with battery backup and had them strapped down. Ive had one ( I think ) problem bear that goes right through any deterate for the last couple of years. The hives are pretty remote so theres no easy trash cans for them to move on to.\n\n\nI can't bring myself to put down nail boards or anything harmful like that.\n Comment: I was thinking an extended base, so they would be a foot or more into the building. I may use a rope and pulleys to help me lift full supers onto a cart. The back isn't going to put up with that for much longer.\n Comment: The location of my building doesn't really suit keeping bees, there is bylaws and also my apartment faces another building so if I tried to do it all sneaky somewould see it and there is a bigger chance someone might get stung since there is alot of foot trafic.\n Comment: Ah yes, the legendary *el dornado*\n Comment: Bees are just universally interesting.\n Comment: That stings.\n Comment: But isn't batman just a ninja with extra steps?\n Comment: *Adam West pulls out can of Bee-Repellent Bat-Spray from utility belt*\n Comment: Murder hornets.\n Comment: Go forth and share!!!\n Comment: I mean, I'm all for weed falling from the sky like manna, I'd just rather it be somewhere else.\n Comment: Wow thanks for your input! That's so awesome your aunt is open to the idea! I looove bees and enjoy watching videos of beekeepers tending to their farms etc. Watching them handle bees often without any gear on and learning that they are so gentle and non aggressive was mind blowing to me!

There have definitely been times where I've not been careful *enough* and gotten stung, but in general, less is more. I definitely do NOT recommend that people who are not used to handling bees to try and be like that woman whose videos float around on here where she doesn't wear any gear and just goes in and grabs bees by the handful, but if you take your time, you should get more comfortable. Try to remember that honeybees usually will not sting unless you are really messing with them bc when they sting someone it usually kills them.

We must protect her at all costs\n Comment: this woman has been called out multiple times for being extremely irresponsible and for not telling the truth regarding all of this stuff\n Comment: Ugh this girl is insufferable.\n Comment: She’s definitely a keeper.\n Comment: She's everywhere\n Comment: I could watch that all day\n Comment: She’s being condemned on how she’s handling the bees. Not safe.\n Comment: This woman is a fraud and is astroturfing on reddit thru middle men to artificially promote her content to the front page on a consistent basis. \n\nShe says she has a relationship with bees when all it is is the gas she uses to relax them and make them docile to handle. \n\nShe's preying on ingorance.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Still pissed the said behaviour and not beehaviour\n Comment: I don't understand why they don't attack her\n Comment: The absolute legend she got lucky with those bees\n Comment: The number of incels and general haters in this thread is too damn high\n Comment: Tik tok Issa REALLY trying it's hardest, man. I'm so close to downloading the app. I'm right there, but I'm not gonna do it. No no.\n Comment: Bee ASMR\n Comment: Bee keeping seems like such a cool underated hobby/job\n Comment: Hot chick moves bees from nature to make free money out of - video 136\n Comment: She’s the beezknees\n Comment: A gentle Bee soul is she. Long Live The Bees! 🐝\n Comment: It’s really nice what she’s doing but the way she talks and how close she is to her mic makes me so uncomfortable\n Comment: Beekeepers are always the most chilled people you will ever meet\n Comment: Girl scoops handfuls of bees with her hand: nothing happens.\nMeanwhile, bees regularly cross the Atlantic just to sting my ass.\n Comment: I'm sure she meant 'I understand bee-havior'.\n Comment: How many times did she get stung??\n Comment: Stupid question, but how did this save them, weren’t they perfectly chill in the washing machine?\n Comment: This lady is a true Queen bee.\n Comment: How do you not get stung?\nDo you have superpowers - Affinity to Bees? \nAre you the real Queen 👑 Bee 🐝?\n\n👑🐝👑\n Comment: I took a course in beekerping at university and we cared for a have for a semester. I saw bees slipping out of the their chanber live, interacted with them and stole a fingertip of the freshly collected honey before it ripens in the comb. It is amazing and I'll hobby beekeep once I am in the right spot to do it. Cant wait to care for a hive or two. (Also sry for the wrong vocab english isnt my first language)\n Comment: This lady is currently being canceled by BeeTok haha\n Comment: Why aren’t they stinging her?\n Comment: Uh her voice is so relaxing! But honestly she’s such a superhero for animals. I don’t know many men or women or people as badass and cool as she is!\n Comment: You do awesome work, and your videos are cool too!\n Comment: This is very wholesome\n Comment: That was legitimately awesome!\n Comment: They can be accepted into other colonies, especially if they bring gifts of pollen and other bee stuff\n\nNot sure what happens if they don't get accepted though\n Comment: Seconded! Are they just like \"hey guys! Guys? ...guys?\" And then they just buzz off to die??\n Comment: They die eventually. They only live for about 6 weeks during the main season.\n Comment: That’s why she left it for a few hours. So the last of them could get to the new hive. Of course, some won’t make it. But it’s about preserving the hive, not every individual be. I imagine she stepped on some or cut them when she cut the comb in half or squished some. It’s inevitable. But when they’re in a safe place, they’ll reproduce and be even more productive. \n\nShort answer, they die\n Comment: I always think that, like the ones who are out, what happens when they get back and their whole colony is gone?\n Comment: I've always wondered what happens if a bee gets crushed. Won't that piss them off? Moving frames, the hive box, and other stuff seems risky.\n Comment: The queens attendants surround her as she walks around. The nurse bees kind of form a circle around her. If you watch carefully, you will be able to find her. She is also usually the biggest one in the hive and has a long body.\n Comment: Moshpit of Bees sounds like it'd be a great metal band lol\n Comment: Sir, that’s a coffee table book of photos from World War II…\n Comment: I read that as mopshit\n\nStill works\n Comment: I can't even find the Waldo book my friends gave me as a joke.\n Comment: Wasn’t there something about these videos being set up?\n Comment: They get accepted into another hive or they die.\n Comment: You have to remember that a bees sting means death to them.  If they dont feel like their queen is in mortal danger they're mostly chill.\n Comment: Not all species of bee are super aggressive\n\nI'm used to living near killer bees so this was also really wtf to me too lol\n Comment: There's way to keep the bees docile but this particular beekeeper is under a lot of criticism because she's not showing properly the precautions and safety gears one should use before opening a wild hive.\n\nhttps://www.thecut.com/2021/06/the-backlash-against-the-tiktok-bee-lady-explained.html\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: They are drugged with a bee smoker https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_smoker\n Comment: “MY BRIEFCASE OF BEES OUGHTA PUT A STOP TO THAT”\n Comment: \"THIS HORROBLE CAR CRASH HAS BEEN MADE MORE PAINFUL WITH THE ADDITION OF YET MORE BEES!\"\n Comment: I've actually seen footage of a flatbed hauling hives that got into a wreck. It was a mess. Biggest swarm I've ever seen.\n Comment: That happened in my town a few years ago, except it was a semi full.  The town was put in a kind of lockdown.  My house was about a half mile from the accident and there were millions in our yard.\n Comment: Who are our native pollinators???\n\nThe yellow ~~butt~~ striped bros?\n Comment: Yeah for real. \"Saving the bees\" in this case is the equivalent of...getting your cow after it breaks out of its fence and walks into your neighbor's field, or something. Apis mellifera actually displaces our native bees at a notable level...\n Comment: THANK YOU shocked how many people don’t know this\n Comment: I'm not a beekeeper, but my grandparents quasi-kept bees (they were just kinda on their property and they would snipe some honeycomb once in a while). I remember helping to scoop up bees as a really little kid, like 5 or 6 years old, and nobody wore any protective equipment. I never got stung.\n\nOf course, I never filmed any of this for a 1 minute video... I don't really see the controversy with this bee woman.\n\nIf you're familiar with bees, and you know their behavior, I don't see the controversy. \n\nMost people avoid bees like the plague anyway. I honestly don't get the dust up about her.\n Comment: There's definitely a lot of work and preparation going on in the background that we don't see. Extractions can take hours or sometimes a full day depending on where the hive is and the bees sometimes go through waves of passiveness and aggression. She most likely didn't do the whole extraction like that or other people in proper PPE came in to help out when the video cuts.\n Comment: It’s literally totally faked, like she got exposed for it\n Comment: Yeah, seems really bold to try to work with an unknown hive without a suit.\n Comment: I'm gonna guess that it's not an ideal home for the bees though. In a hive box they get a perfect structure to build on and it's easier for the keeper to monitor their health.\n Comment: It's also not legal to keep them in something like that. Bees are livestock. You have to be able to inspect them properly. Bees get all kinds of diseases and pests associated with disease. You don't want that spreading to other hives or native pollinators. You wouldn't be able to do that with a traditional skep. It's why you don't see traditional skeps anymore. It's not legal. I want to say not legal in any state but there is probably some weird law somewhere that allows it.\n Comment: This gives me a funny mental image of her bee farm being a bunch of random objects lined in a row. \n\nA washing machine, a tire, a birdhouse, a CRT with a broken screen...\n Comment: In my opinion it’s a matter of; a) better home/hive for the bees with the wood layered box; and b) it’s much easier to move and place at her bee home ranch area than moving an old washer. Such as needing several people and tools to remove and replace the washer at a different place, versus just a few hours of a single bee keeper to re-home them and move them in the wooden box.\n Comment: Asmr beeeees\n Comment: I thought it was a text to speech program at first to be honest....\n Comment: I wouldn’t call it whispering but I don’t know what I WOULD call it.  Either way I find it hard to listen to for some reason.\n Comment: I watch with the sound off when I come across her videos, I like that she's relocating bees, but I can't stand her voice.\n Comment: I prefer it to the inane yelling that most content producers do\n Comment: What bothers me is the over enunciating of every single word. Nobody talks like that and it comes off extremely condescending for some weird reason I can't quite figure out. Like I'm being talked to like a child.\n Comment: Same, I absolutely hate her fucking voice. It's like, ASMR bait or something? Idk if it weren't for that I'd probably actually enjoy her videos but holy fuck I can't make it through a single one.\n Comment: I was looking for this comment, I hated the voice over like ASMR with knives\n Comment: I can't imagine what you'd consider actual whispering if you think what she's doing is whispering when she's just speaking softly.\n Comment: Absolutely drives me fuckin nuts. What she does is super awesome and everything, but wtf is up with the voiceovers? It’s the most annoying thing ever. Just speak in your normal ass manner or don’t speak at all and add the text.\n Comment: I'm not sure why, but *every single voiceover* on tiktok irritates me. They all talk with a certain cadence and tonality that is really difficult to listen to. Even the TTS computer voice does it.\n Comment: I might be one of the only people who enjoy her voice. It fits, for some reason, although I don't think I'd enjoy it if I heard it somewhere else\n Comment: The way I read it is that she isn’t necessarily a phony, but doesn’t show what it takes to make the bees calm like that. There are numerous other bee professionals that think her editing out that stuff is dangerous and will cause people to think they can just grab bees and not get hurt thus leading to possible  injury or deaths in wannabe bee keepers.\n\nEdit: autocorrect\n Comment: I tried to read that... it got hard.. all I could get out of it before my brain gave out, is everyone is hating on her for encouraging unsafe bee handling practices by not showing her other precautionary measures in the video, and dressing “inappropriately” for that kind of work. \n\nLemme know if there’s more to it, cuz I thought the vid was pretty cool\n Comment: More for glorifying unsafe practices with a bit of potential phoniness on the side, at least that I saw.\n Comment: Obviously she’s not a phony. But every time she posts these videos, people ask “how does she not get stung???” And some confident idiot will chime in “Aha! For you see, honey bees die if they sting! They will only sting as a last resort. If they don’t think the Queen is in danger, they will not sting!” Which is just nonsense. She literally grabs the Queen and puts it in a little jail cell. \n\nAn intruder into the hive is  100% a threat to the Queen and bees don’t give a fuck if they die. \n\nShe smokes the hive and that makes them docile. Maybe she does some other stuff too. Nobody should be under the impression that they won’t get stung if they try this.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: This is like the most biased and derogatory article I have read this week from a respectable source.\n Comment: My general take was people were upset about things that went on behind the scenes (help from her man, and use of smoke) because god forbid someone makes videos for TikTok and.....edits them.\n Comment: It’s not so much that she doesn’t do anything, it’s that she’s absolutely misrepresenting what she actually does. Her husband goes in geared up, smokes up the bees, uses the tools needed to get into wherever the bees are that they aren’t supposed to be, and if the bees are docile enough, he films her scooping bees with her hands like they aren’t living things with stingers. \n\nI grew up around bees: my mom and a bunch of her friends kept hives, my sister still has hives. The way she describes and strategically shows bees isn’t representative of how bees normally behave and could lead to someone getting seriously fucked up. Especially because she’s based in Texas where they have a problem of Africanized bees.\n Comment: I gotta check that link out. As I was watching I was thinking there is no way in hell I would be able lay brood comb on its side and start hacking it in pieces to fit a frame without the little buggers going ape shit. I’m no pro but I’ve got 8 hives so I’ve been around a few.\n Comment: I remeber seeing another post with an \"actual\" female bee keeper going off on an absolute tangent on how this chick is a fraud\n Comment: [Nah, Slate interviewed some expert beekeepers about her and they said she was legit.](https://slate.com/technology/2021/06/beekeeper-lady-tiktok-sting-gear.html)\n Comment: Now this is the kinda low stakes inconsequential drama I love reading\n Comment: Beesus christ this is stupid. If you're deciding to take a crack at ameteur bee handling based on tiktok videos then that's your own goddamn fault for being dumb.\n Comment: Maybe, but these kinds of hive relocation videos are pretty common on this sub\n\nThey're always fascinating\n Comment: I actually love Tiktok. Once you spend a day or two liking videos and following people, it does a REALLY good job of showing you similar content. I get videos of donkeys, a couple of good comedians, and videos of people being nice to strangers.\n Comment: Redditors love parroting the idea that it’s annoying kids dancing but there’s way better content on there than what I usually see on here. Their algorithm is awesome at figure you out.\n Comment: I think you’re really cool u/lar5502!\n Comment: Her body is controlled by a billion bees. A literally hive mind.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: It’s only one person lahoneybeerescue\n Comment: Yep, she drives me insane and I can’t really figure out why\n Comment: Same\n Comment: I love that smiling absurd amount of food making guy\n Comment: There have been a few articles. But they all read as very petty with her not wearing gear in her videos.\nShe’s not giving a tutorial, she’s creating social media content. It’s the same complaint over and over and it just seems like some other salty beekeepers. \nGiving warnings that this isn’t the safest? Great! Calling her a fraud? Seems like an overreach.\n Comment: Im so happy to find this, i find her voice absolutely disgusting. Like it wreaks of arrogance.\n Comment: Ronin bees.\n Comment: They generally only live for a matter of weeks anyways, so likely if they aren’t accepted by a nearby colony fairly soon they die.\n Comment: “Bee stuff” made me lolll\n Comment: Ah, they’ll come back.\n Comment: Yeah that's the equivalent of if you go off to the grocery store or somewhere and when you get back, you're entire house is just gone\n Comment: Guess I'll die\n Comment: 6 weeks of getting fat on honey. What a life\n Comment: Some of you may die but that’s a risk I’m willing to take \n\n- Bee keeper probably\n Comment: So are there other girl bees or do all of them mate with just her? Cause if so, God save the Queen.\n Comment: Ahhh. Just like the Borg Queen.\n Comment: It is also the collective noun I'm gonna start using for bees. I don't care how wrong it is.\n Comment: Agreed\n Comment: Or they are forced to survive the wastelands alone\n Comment: Is that why they don’t react when she softly flicks them off her hands after having scooped them off a surface?\n Comment: This is true. My grandfather used to keep bees. He’s scoop them all day and never get stung. He loved those bees. Often he’d make the corniest jokes too. Sometimes he’d just make a little buzzing sound and give you a little peck on the cheek. But then he’d just go back outside and scoop some bees. It was so ingrained into our daily routine. I’d wake up to get some cereal, and I’d find the box of raisin bran all scribbled out and replaced with “TWO SCOOPS OF BEES.” Every raisin would be painstakingly drawn over and turned into a bee. Things kept getting weirder, like he’d insist the honey should only be eaten by the kids. After a while he would just tape a thumb tack to his butt. Yet he was the one who would scream in sheer terror if you got close to it. “Don’t touch my stinger!” Of course, eventually, someone did. My cousin bumped into it by accident. He yelped in surprise and my grandfather turned around and just said “now you’ve done it! Now you’ve done it!”  He marched off into the shed, and loaded his gun. My mom went in after him and said “you can’t be serious!” And he just said “you better BEE-lieve it!” and shot himself in the chest.\n\nBut yeah bees are totally harmless!\n Comment: Exactly...I've had thousands of bees swarming me and maybe been stung about 20 times\n Comment: Bees have absolutely no sense of self preservation. They operate as a hive, not an individual. They don’t think “oh no I’ll die if I sting!” They think “intruder in the hive! Attack!” \n\nThe reason they’re so docile is because she gassed them, moves very slowly and calmly, and has a lot of experience handling bees. \n\nThey probably do sting her a little bit.\n Comment: That's only true for one species of bee. Most bee species can sting repeatedly without dying, like bumblebees for example. Honeybees do die from stinging, however that doesn't mean they can't or won't sting if provoked.\n Comment: It really doesn't. Humans are pretty much the only thing that a bee stinger gets stuck in. Bees do not expect to die from stinging us.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: And even in the same species certain hives are more passive than others.\n Comment: Are killer bees aggressive?\n Comment: Turns out, not that controversial:\n\n>\tWhile seeing someone scoop up bees with their bare hands may be alarming for most of us, the risk is much lower for someone with extensive experience handling bees. As Dr. Judy Wu-Smart, research entomologist at the Bee Lab at University of Nebraska–Lincoln, told the Cut, the methods used in the video don’t appear to be dangerous for “experienced beekeepers who understand the biology and behavior of honeybees.”\n\n>Kearney echoed the importance of understanding bees’ behavior in determining the risk of interacting with a hive. “Every bee colony and every situation is unique,” Kearney explained, noting that the necessity of certain gear varies depending on the situation. “Many beekeepers work with minimal to no protective clothing.”\n\n>As for whether Thompson’s videos in particular are cause for concern, Kearney said she trusts Thompson’s judgment given her experience: “She is in fact the only person who can accurately judge whether it is safe because she is the only person who is there working those specific bees.”\n Comment: My uncle’s a beekeeper. I showed him this and he just shook his head and laughed.\n Comment: Weird.  Backlash?  Why?  She's not claiming to be teaching anyone anything about (re)moving hives, she's just showing cool videos about her day.  It'd be like me watching a snowboarder do a double cork and then complaining he didn't teach it right after I snapped my spine trying to duplicate it.\n Comment: Am I wrong assuming she likely gets a few stings here, but just doesn’t mention it?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: There's a whole Lotta beekeeper hate up in here, I think it's jealousy.  \n\nEveryone knows you're supposed to wear this suit when you go get honey and work on beehives, to the point of being cliché, so it's obviously she's a bee whisperer!  Any dumbass wants to do the same thing as her is the equivalent of someone trying to pretend there fucking Steve Irwin 20 years ago!\n Comment: This is so stupid. If you watch a tik tok and then go shove your hand in a bee hive without googling literally anything else first, that’s on you. Personally I think she’s doing a lot more to *help* bees by showing millions of people that they’re not mindlessly aggressive. A lot of people are afraid of perfectly harmless bees.\n Comment: A lot of criticism…. From one single person\n Comment: There are a lot of people that seem jealous in that article. Saving one colony sounds like saving bees to me.\n\nBut, I also have the sense not to walk up to a beehive because some woman did it on a video online.\n Comment: She always always *always* makes sure to explicitly mention that the only reason she’s not using full gear is that this is a case where it’s not necessary for *her* - if you think she being misleading then you’re trying to be mislead.\n Comment: It is tricky being hot in a beekeepers suit - part of her success online has to be down to her looks - I’m sure she is a very qualified beekeeper, but being qualified alone rarely sells tickets, regardless of what field the person is in\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: **“WHAT’S THIS? A TRAFFIC COLLISION WOEFULLY UNDERPOPULATED BY BEES!? A LARGE INFLUX OF BEES OUGHT TO PUT A STOP TO THAT!”**\n Comment: PSA that there's a new [Dr. Bees video that just came out, seven years after the last one](https://youtu.be/hBZmQdFbVcY).\n Comment: There are hundreds of bees native to NA! Hard to identify in my opinion. Butterflies and moths are as far as I usually go with insects.\n Comment: There are a bunch of them, and it varies regionally. Planting native flowering plants and not using pesticides is a good way to support them. You can also get carpenter bee nests.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Most bee species aren't like that, and some wannabee-keeper (or child) might think you can just scoop up bees without protective gear and get severely injured or killed\n Comment: Bees’ knees disease, please?\n Comment: What if she had moved the washer to her property and then transferred them? I feel like she probably lost more bees by doing the transfer before moving them. By the way she is amazing and I’m just a jabroni asking questions.\n Comment: They sold me sick bees!\n Comment: BBBeesss\n Comment: Too close to the mic, I think, so it's picking up all the bit of her mouth movements in pops and crackles. Same method ASMR recorders use\n Comment: This is what I was looking for. It’s a tone that makes me so uncomfortable for whatever reason. Ah! I hate it!\n Comment: It's just softly speaking\n Comment: It’s sounds like… wet? Spitty? Regardless, I find it really irritating\n Comment: HELLOOOOO my dudes and duddetes, how are you doing, here's Mr bee whisperer with another video I hope you might like.\n\n<15 seconds logo intro>\n\nBut first, a message from my sponsor.\n\n<30 seconds ad>\n\nWelcome back, how are you doing? Fine? Great! If you don't know a lot about bees, get ready to have your mind blown with what you are about to see.\n\nI've been doing this job for years so it is advised that you don't try this yourself as you might get stung really bad and we don't want that do we my dudes and duddetes?\n\nHahaha of course not, well let's start NNNNOOOOOOWWWWW\n\n<hard rock music>\n\nWhile handling bees I'm always safe with my Golden Fingers gloves. I couldn't recommend these enough, they are comfortable and protect me from the bees as you will see in a moment.\n\nIf you want to get this gloves my dudes and duddetes, just click here <points to ad> and you will be taken to an Amazon page where your can get them.\n\nDisclaimer hahaha, i will get a small amount of that purchase, i appreciate it a lot.\n\nAnd speaking of commissions, please subscribe to my Patreon where you will learn all about bees in a cool, fun way, there are several tiers and you can pick the one that suits you best.\n\nI appreciate it.\n\nWithout further ado, let's cut to the video of how I handled thousands of bees, but not now dudes and duddetes, that's coming next week, thanks for your attention.\n\nSTAY TUNED!\n\n<15 seconds logo outro, heavy metal music>\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: For me its the inflection that she ends sentences with. Starts high ends low, but generally monotone.\n Comment: Had to dive deep here but I was pretty convinced its text-to-speech, she sounds way too unnatural.\n Comment: It is exactly this. A lot of beekeepers are not cool with her acting like all bees are like this and not even, at minimum, wearing a veil. Getting stung in the eye region is a massive situation where you should be getting medical help ASAP. Depending on where you get stung, you can go blind. That's the extreme end of it but you can prevent that by wearing a veil. I'm kinda in the middle about her videos. I think she should show what actually goes into it instead of the Instagram worthy parts that make it look easy and chill.\n Comment: This comment saved my life\n Comment: I remember watching Evel Knievel as a kid. I didn't go jumping canyons.  \nI appreciate that's an extreme example, but why the hell is common sense at an all-time low?\n Comment: tiktok videos have to be greatly shortened, there's a warning in the video clearly saying that the bees are calm only because she knows what she's doing, do not try at home type of thing.\n Comment: My friend has been keeping bees for 15 years or so and he rarely uses any kind of protective equipment, rarely uses a smoker, also has long hair, etc.  I have seen him moving bees by the handful.  But he's not an attractive woman, so nobody's calling him a fake...\n Comment: But I don’t get the drama. It seems to all be stirred up for the sake of generating controversy. She DOES have videos where she is wearing the full beekeeping getup. She has videos where she is taking precautions and doing dangerous stuff.\n\nObviously she has a goal of primarily communicating that bees can be out “friends,” but is that a bad thing?\n Comment: I missed the part of *any* of her videos where she encourages anyone to go try to catch bees.\n\nReddit is a cesspit of envy and jealousy.\n Comment: They accused her of staging bee rescues, sedating the bees beforehand, and her husband pre-cutting the honey combs so it's easier for her. They also accused her of wearing the wrong clothes and possibly making people think bees won't hurt them without any safety equipment.\n\nI have no idea either way. But that's what they're accusing her of.\n Comment: They casually dropped a line in there that she is a trump supporter. But then didn’t really elaborate on how that was relevant or how they even knew.\n Comment: Check your facts man, that husband shits been debunked. She had this business for years before him and he's a real estate agent.\n Comment: What evidence is there that her non-beekeeper husband is at all involved?\n Comment: Yeah, that part kinda got me. It does look like it's edited in that area. So she may have shook off that piece. Otherwise she would have squished 100s of bees doing that. Which is super counterintuitive.\n Comment: Lol yeah bc she has a content creator aesthetic, which she obviously is doing. And that’s okay. Nobody wants to watch some chick in a giant beekeeper costume scoop up bees. \n\nIt just 100% sounds like jealousy. Idk how the hell she is a fraud when she is literally showing a video handling bees.\n Comment: Great article! It definitely reframed some stuff beekeepers told me. I would still not fuck around bees without protection.\n Comment: Is it her voice?\n\nFaking / staging her bee adventures is one thing, but then the way she edits and narrates it almost seems like some weird **ASMR** thing...\n Comment: They call them influencers for a reason.\n\nIn the wise words of Red Foreman \"Safety first, dumbass\"\n Comment: Yup.   The (most of them) folks in the beekeeping thread echo these same two or three complaints.\n\nI have bees and I like her.   I also would never do some of the stuff she does.   But you know what, lots of people work gloveless all of the time.   And also, even a not great beekeeper like me can tell pretty quickly when the bees are calm and can be worked with.   In all of her videos where she is being “extremely risky”, according to her critics, the bees are calm AF.  The critique about them pre checking the hives, pre cutting frames and such prior to the video is almost certainly true- so what?  If anything the process of the prep work allowed her to assess (suited up) if the hive was calm enough to finish un veiled and make one of these videos.\n\nShe’s making cool content.\n Comment: Beekeeping suits are literally white so as to not antagonize the hive into thinking an intruder is barging in who has ill intent. Most of the animals and insects that go after the honey have dark fur. Least she could do is wear white mufti.\n Comment: Yojimbee.\n Comment: I want a tv show of this. It makes me happy to think about a Ronin bee fighting to save a farm from bandit insects. It's honestly be sick\n Comment: And if they’re accepted, they die soon.\n Comment: All honeybees are female, except for the drones. The drones are male. They don't have stingers and their contribution is genetic material for a future hive. They don't mate with the current queen as that is their mother. If they go out on a mating flight, a large group of them will find a virgin queen from a different hive and mate with her. Mating kills drones. Drones get kicked out of the hive for the winter to die. They will make new ones the next season. Honeybee hives are a collective. The queen is not actually in control. If the hive thinks their queen isn't doing a good job, they will make a new queen, and requeen their own hive. I had a hive do that. They didn't think the queen was doing well, they grew a new one, and killed their original one after the virgin queen came back from a mating flight. This is obviously the short version. There's a lot more that goes into it.\n Comment: Most of the bees are girls. She only mates with drones.\n Comment: i’m not an expert, my knowledge comes from bee vids. now if i’ve got it right, the queen lays eggs, most of the they’re workers and drones. sometimes the queen lays a special egg and when the bee hatches it’s fed ultra-concentrated slurm that turns it into a slurm queen.\n Comment: Then they are referred to by other bees as \"Vault dweller\".\n Comment: As another commented stated\n\nRonin bees\n Comment: Flicking like that isn't enough to hurt them.\n\nUsually bees need a reason to want to sting you and are pretty chill (I've done some work a beehive and haven't been stung yet but I'm not brave enough to get that close without a suit regardless).\n\nSome colonies can have a bad attitude which a beekeeper might try to resolve by replacing the queen.\n\nBees are extra chill/distracted when they smell smoke or if they're swarming.\n Comment: A lot of fear towards bees is wrongly attributed to the slightly more hostile yellow jackets (who are not as aggressive as you would assume) and the far more aggressive wasps (who are much more aggressive then you would assume)\n\nThis fear is entirely associated with stupid parents endlessly feeding lies to their children about how dangerous insects can be, not realizing that they are just spouting bullshit their parents told them that they heard from their parents, etc etc.\n Comment: That’s not at _all_ how I remember _Bee Movie_ going.\n Comment: I was going along, thinking “this is odd but plausible”… that’s when I reached the thumbtack.\n Comment: You had me going there bud.

You have all of my love regardless.\n\nEDIT NO 2: “He’s simple. Never been quite right though, no ma’am, not since he got kicked in the head by that mule. Never been quite right since. Dumb sonofabitch had it coming though.”\n Comment: Fricking hilarious. Had me busting up. 😂\n Comment: I had to pause about halfway through because I thought this was a shittymorph.

I think?\n Comment: I'd be willing to bet 99.9% of people have never been stung by a honey bee. Instead the assume or associate a sting from a wasp/hornet/other was from a honey bee. I have a lot of lavender in front of my house and in the summer they are covered in honey bees, they don't seem to care about my presence one bit, they just want to roll around in pollen and suck that sweet nectar. One of the many animals that gets a bad wrap for no reason. Honey bees and opossums are always welcome around my land.\n Comment: Wtffff\n Comment: Really expected the Undertaker to show up at the end there.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: That's not entirely true. Their stinger is barbed and get stuck in lots of things. Hawk hummingbird moths attack hives. They harass my hives sometimes to the point that guard bees start taking them down by stinging and their stingers get yanked out. They have also stung my dogs and the bears locally. Their stingers get stuck as well. As long as that barb gets in there enough, it will rip their butt and venom sac out.\n Comment: She does too, she’s in Austin! A man was literally killed by Africanized bees in Texas this past March. This is why I think this whole persona of hers is dangerous. There’s no way she encounters “docile” bees as often as she does\n Comment: Yes, people have been attacked by just walking close to a hive and they have been known to kill horses \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanized_bee\n Comment: Its kinda in the name no?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I'm a beekeeper and I 100% agree with Dr. Wu-Smart.  I actually know the beekeeper that used to run the Bee Lab at UNL, but I don't think I've met Dr. Wu-Smart.  Anyway each beekeeper has their own style and standards too.  I tend to prefer to be geared up.  I just have never got used to the initial pain of a sting and it can cause me to make a mistake which makes things worse.  I really dislike scooping them with my hands too.  It gives me the creeps.  \n\nBut on the other hand, my buddy is out digging around in his hives like she does wearing nothing.  If he takes a sting or two he doesn't react at all.  I yelp darn near every time.\n Comment: Jealousy / misogyny.\n Comment: She has stated on her profile she doesn’t get stung ever because “she knows the bees”\n\nI’m sure you’re right and she’s just denying it for some reason but yeah she sticks to “they don’t sting me”\n Comment: That and a lot else is probably being left out of her videos to make them seem bee-positive.\n Comment: She one hundred percent gets stung every now and then.\n Comment: If your dumb enough to partake in a hobby like this and are learning from one tiktok, then getting sting is on them.\n Comment: But why would anyone, especially someone that wants to be a beekeeper, look at this and think “oh, cool, this thing I want to do and have apparently not researched at all looks easy. I don’t recall if I have ever heard of a single person having an interaction with a bee that wasn’t exactly like this video I just watched.”\n Comment: That’s actually a good comparison. Like Steve, I’m sure she’s been hurt by the critters on occasion — but also like Steve, she understands that risk and is using her platform to show people that the animals aren’t something to be afraid of, that they’re beautiful and worth saving. I think shes fantastic.\n\nAnd just like with Steve and snakes/crocs, I’m not gonna run out and scoop up bees with my bare hands expecting it to go as smoothly for me as it does for this woman.\n Comment: Eh, the voiceover is nice, bees are popular, it's a 10 second feel-good story, all that shit social media loves.  I bet a guy could do the same thing and find success.  I bet a couple could easily do it if the guy did all the on-camera work and a woman did the voiceovers.\n Comment: Bro, she’s wearing jeans and flannel shirt 😂\nGo take a cold shower.\n Comment: wtf lmao, that took the weirdest turn\n\nyou really need to get out more.\n Comment: They are not always docile. They can be very defensive. I had a very very docile hive go batshit on me because something was bothering them at night. They started flipping out any time anything went near the hive. Having a docile hive does not mean they won't ever be aggressively defensive.\n Comment: Pretty sure she smoked them before she started filming or they at least got some smoke. You can see the wind blowing it on them. Plus I swear I saw smoke coming out when she first opens it. Other videos she doesn’t use it though\n Comment: I mean, there is a smoker right there in the intro to this video.\n Comment: **DEAR LORD, THE SITUATION HAS ONLY BEEN MADE WORSE WITH THE ADDITION OF YET MORE BEES**\n Comment: I’m not pressing that until It is proven to not be a rick roll\n Comment: What the fuck did I just watch and why was it so much funnier than it had any right to bee.\n Comment: I mean, no offense, but so what? What’s the justification for the criticism? We shouldn’t show things on the internet done by professionals that might be dangerous if amateurs copied it? I think it’s a little ridiculous to blame an entertainment video for not being properly instructional when it’s not meant to be. I also think it’s a little ridiculous to expect 1-minute tik tok videos to meet those standards lmao\n Comment: Legal stuff?  \nOh please, they're guaranteed to sieze fees or rupees for me keeping bees, aw jeez such sleaze. All to appease those with expertise and their pleas to prevent the disease they forsee. You agree?\n\nFor the record I think it's OK to follow the guidelines of professionals to maintain healthy bees... I'm just not good enough at rhyming to write that out.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Bad ASMR feels just as intense as the best types of ASMR.. but in the worst way.

If you get injured in just the right way, your body’s main immune system will identify your eyes as foreign and attack them, causing blindness. This is also why, occasionally, an injury in one eye is accompanied by blindness in the other.\n Comment: Was stung in the eye when I was 3 years old. Never realized how fortunate I am that I didn't go blind.\n\nAlso that was an absolutely horrifying experience\n Comment: > at minimum, wearing a veil  \n\n“But how else would people know I’m a sexy social media influencer???”\n Comment: The lack of protection is the icing on the cake. long hair is also dangerous. if a group of bees gets stuck in that, they can sting the neck and cause serious issues\n Comment: In the future, no less!\n Comment: Common sense has never been common. All the warning labels out there were not created due to the current younger generation. There were many generations before them to figure out all the dumb shit not to do.\n Comment: I'm surprised a fucking dumbass didn't jump off a canyon.\n Comment: People aren't really mad about the safety issue, if there's even an issue at all. They're jealous of the popularity of the creator and there is an undercurrent of suggestion that she's only popular because she's attractive and has a sultry sounding voice. Which, not gonna lie, she does kinda sound like ASMR. But anyway yeah that's my impression of it. When you watch the \"calling out\" videos they're grasping at straws. People want to be mad for some reason.\n Comment: The major criticism started with a rival beekeeper TikTok if that makes it any better. People are a cesspit of envy and jealousy.\n Comment: > and possibly making people think bees won't hurt them without any safety equipment.\n\nHonestly, my best mate is a keeper ( I am personally terrified of them more than a child of the boogeyman) but my first reaction to her was \"what the fuck are doing stupid\"\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Don’t you know? It’s impossible for a woman to do cool things on her own. So that means it must be her husband. \n\n/s\n Comment: She is saving bees. Im all for it!\nShe does not write disclaimer? I don't care, I don't plan on moving 10lbs of bees anytime soon. If a see a hive, I'll call an expert. \n\nWho in their right mind will see this video and start digging in a hive? Clearly someone called her to get the bees, that's the first clue  that you should call someone.\n\nI don't see nowhere in the title where it's says it's a tutorial...

But only because I accidentally sat on her, so I don't blame her. She had landed on my capris outside and when I didn't see her, I went inside and sat down to watch football. Yes, the sting hurt. But it was in the middle of my buttcheek, which is probably one of the least sensitive places to get stung.\n\nYellow jackets, on the other hand, can all go fuck off.\n Comment: I've been stung by honey bees twice. \n\nFirst time was when I trod on one barefoot. It was feeding from some clover and I was stupid enough to be in the garden without shoes on. Fair enough really. \n\nSecond time I was just vaguely near their hive (~5m) and one particular bee took a disliking to me. Landed on my arm and stung me. Had to retreat pretty quickly, because once a bee stings it emits a pheromone that calls in all its buddies to do the same thing. Still don't get why that particular bee saw me as a threat. I've spent plenty of time around those hives before and since and they're never normally aggressive. \n\nBut in general you're right. If bees aren't defending their hive and don't think you're going to kill them, they're very unlikely to sting.\n Comment: **[Africanized_bee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanized_bee)** \n \n >The Africanized bee, also known as the Africanized honey bee and known colloquially as the \"killer bee\", is a hybrid of the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), produced originally by crossbreeding of the East African lowland honey bee (A. m. scutellata) with various European honey bee subspecies such as the Italian honey bee (A. m.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)\n Comment: In South Texas, where wild hives are assumed to be Africanized, we have to take extra precautions. Each bee is no more venomous than European bees, but they turn out in larger numbers, and chase a potential threat farther. Most people who are stung were operating motorized equipment. Animals can also be stung to death. \n\nDespite their increased aggressiveness, the number of people killed by Africanized bees is fairly low. The death toll in the US is 1 or 2 people every year. There are many creatures that are more dangerous than \"killer bees\".\n Comment: Apparently that was a false report and their account has now been reinstated.\n Comment: Rival viral. Nice.\n Comment: Just want to point out the initial person who called her out was a fellow female beekeeper from California who posted some tiktoks saying she was inexperienced, didn't use the proper gear and that her husband would carve up the bee hives beforehand and do all the real work. She has since retracted her statements, deleted her social media, closed her business, and published a note saying she was actually trying to support the other bee keeper.\n Comment: You can see 2 stings on her hand.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: It's like learning to grow crystals on 4chan.\n Comment: I just hope she doesnt end up like Steve\n Comment: You're getting down votes, but you're absolutely right. I used to have around 500 hives. What people don't realize here is that she *is* getting stung, she just isn't reacting to it because you get used to it.\n Comment: Why not just wear the beekeeper outfit and not get stung at all?  Is it really that much of a hassle to work in it?\n Comment: Also according to the video as presented, she's walking up to wild bees and just jumping in without any protection at all.  You open that lid in street clothes to find a colony that's been Africanized and you are fucked.\n Comment: I took the sacrifice soldier\n\nit's dr. bees return, it is glorious\n Comment: Good to know.

I took an antibiotic that triggered an extreme (and rare) autoimmune reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. I actually had the most severe form called Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Google images are  NSFL). \n\nMy immune system attacked my corneas and melted them. It also fused my eyelids to my eyeballs (which had to be ripped apart multiple times) and the eyelid scarring has caused my eyelashes to grow in incorrectly, sometimes turning in towards my eyes or inside the lash line. It sucks.\n Comment: More accurately it's an immune privileged area. the main immune system does not normally have access to it. If it gains access accidentally it can recognize the eye as foreign and attack it.\n Comment: Eyeronically\\*\n Comment: I have gotten bees stuck in my hair.

Not sure why it wouldn't be but it sounds automated. Listen to how certain words seem copy / pasted and in an odd tone ('hive' in particular).

They would then have to get accepted by that hive, which is a process. Honeybees only live for about 6 weeks during the main season. From emergence to death. They do every job in the hive at some point in their life cycle, besides queen. Forager is the last job in the life cycle. The ones that get back too late will hang out in that spot for a day or two before they move to die or try to find another hive.\n Comment: Think of an individual worker bee dying as like you trimming your fingernails.  The colony is the organism. Individual beed are like cells in your body.   They dont matter as long as you can replace them.\n Comment: There's lots of reasons why a hive may reject a queen and it really depends on the hive. I thought my queen was doing ok. She wasn't as \"strong\" as my other queens in my other hives but ok. A good queen lays around 2,000 eggs a day. A newly mated queen takes a bit to get the hang of it but the hive is usually fine with that. A master beekeeper I took courses from had  a queen with a bum leg. She surmised that the queen may have been attacked on her way back to the hive from her mating flight. They don't always make it back. They can be predated upon. She was dragging her leg around the hive and since she was laying like a champ, the hive kept her. \nThis is going to be the \"short\" version. It's kinda involved and I have to go to bed. \nThe making of a honeybee is dependent on a couple of factors. The cell size and what they are fed. All larva are fed royal jelly their first three days. After that drones (males) and workers (females) are fed bee bread until capped. Bee bread is fermented pollen. If you have ever smelled a honeybee hive, they have a yeasty smell to them. That is the fermented pollen. The queen is fed royal jelly her entire growing period until she is capped. Once fully developed the bees chew their way out of the capped cell. \nThe workers make the cells out of wax. Bees of a certain life stage in the hive are the ones that make wax, usually. They also make the correct size cell. Now if you roll (kill by accident) a queen or they want to make a new one, they take a freshly laid egg and then start creating the bigger cell for that queen around it. Queen cells look like peanuts hanging off the frame. Where they make that peanut looking queen cell on the frame, will give you a good idea if they are superseding their queen, want to swarm etc.  so what they are fed at certain larval stages and the size of the cell determines what is born.\n Comment: Fight Club?\n Comment: #freebeetney\n Comment: > *\"Drone better.\"*\r\n\r\n~ Ivan Vanko\n Comment: *game of drones\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: They will give the larva a special kind of food that will turn the larva into a queen.\n Comment: Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of larvae and adult queens. It is secreted from the glands in the hypopharynx of nurse bees, and fed to all larvae in the colony, regardless of sex or caste\n Comment: Beee are cool, no forgiveness for wasps though. Those fuckers are annoying as hell and barely do anything compared to bees.\n Comment: I honestly don't know if there have ever been documented cases of inbreeding. They don't mate with the drones they make though. The virgin hatched queens will go out on a mating flight. Drones from the hive she came from will follow her out and \"chase her\". They only fly so far. She will out fly them etc. she finds drones from other hives that are also out on a mating flight. The drones from her hive will find a queen from a different hive and mate with her. It's how honeybees keep their genetics diverse.\n Comment: The queen only mates once in her life (well, she mates with many drones, but it's all done during a single mating flight), and only after that does she start laying eggs. So mating with her own offspring is impossible.\n\nVirgin queens could potentially mate with their \"brothers\" though. As far as I can find the avoidance is mainly based on statistics rather than any active avoidance measures. Mating flights generally happen at the same time for all hives in a certain area (synchronized simply due to them generally being exposed to the same or at least very similar weather conditions etc.; a lot of bee behaviour is triggered based on weather). When the virgin queens and drones leave their nest they first scatter by flying in random directions. Since drones from all nearby hives do this they get mixed up in the process.\n\nAfter flying some distance the queen then starts releasing pheromones to attract drones with which she will mate. Due to the earlier mixing of the drone swarms statistically the majority of those drones (but probably not all) will be from different hives than her own.\n\nThis polyandry combined with an extraordinarily high genetic recombination rate (highest known among all animals, 20 times higher than in humans for example) ensures that the bees in a hive have significant genetic diversity even though they all come from the same queen.\n Comment: >Queens only mate once in their life.\n\nHow many bee babies typically are produced from this one mating session?\n\nAlso, so they mate once, but with only one drone? Or is it closer to like, a bee gangbang?\n Comment: So… what exactly does she do? Like why is everyone else bowing down to her if she’s not contributing to the group?\n Comment: Drones Going Their Own Way\n Comment: Hahaha this comment made my day. So good. I don't have any awards to give and actually I haven't ever gotten one so I'm a complete award newb. Hopefully my appreciation and admiration is enough. :)\n Comment: All of the bees come from the queen, so if there is an issue with the queen the 're-queening' can be performed to try to resolve certain problems (overly defensive, susceptible to disease, low reproductive output, etc).\n\nIf a queen is an asshole that lays asshole eggs that turn into asshole bees then you can try removing that queen and introducing a new queen, but it can take a while for bees to be replaced by offspring of the new queen.\n Comment: hell yeah\n Comment: That actually still made sense to me, which says a lot more about me than his tale.\n Comment: I just assumed he drawed on the picture in the box of raisins.\n Comment: I stopped about halfway through this to double check the username.

I love honeybees but I also recognize that what she is doing is dangerous. I don't necessarily think she is a fraud. She is just not being totally upfront about what she is doing. You can have docile cut outs and you still get stung during them. \nMy hive that went batshit tagged my spouse 50ft away behind a fence in our driveway.

You can buy a couple \"nucs\" which is a small package of queen and a few drones and slooowly introduce to a hive that is open to the idea. \nIt is witchcraft..and democracy lol\n Comment: Sounds like a true monarchy then.\n Comment: Ohhh got it! What happens if there aren't nearby hives? Or is it just assumed that there's always a nearby hive somewhere\n Comment: Is that first mating flight the only mating flight? Can the queen then lay fertilised eggs indefinitely/until she dies? Or does she need to keep mating?\n Comment: Bee gang bang. Drones flights are usually in the 20 bee range. What they get from the drones will serve them their entire life cycle. They lay about 2,000 eggs a day. I'm in a warm climate, so our queens lay almost year round and they last about 3ish years before they are done. Colder climates I believe it's closer to 6 years but they don't lay during the winter usually.\n Comment: As far as I'm aware it's because she's the only one that can produce any offspring for the hive .\n Comment: The idea that bees (and ants) bow down to their queen is incorrect, and really too much of an anthromorphosation. \n\nThe queen has a central role within a colony in so far as she is the one that lays the eggs and for that role, she is attended to (not expected to forage, fed), but she is not really giving commands. The tasks carried out by each member of the hive are ingrained and often based on age more than anything (as they move through different life stages, they have a different role within the colony/hive; foraging is generally done in the last stage of life) Social insects like this communicate a lot with each other, but it generally doesn't take the form of one member giving an order to another.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: I assumed he had dementia at that point or something.\n Comment: My first assumption was that he was gonna put actual bees in the cereal.\n Comment: I just want you to know that you made my night. :)\n Comment: You remind me of phoebe from friends who never saw the end of old yeller, thought it was just a nice film about a boy and his dog\n Comment: Royal jelly skin care from Texas bee girl. \n  \nFor sure. \n  \nBut hey, fuck it. A million dollars is a million dollars.\n Comment: Very eye opening experience\n Comment: Eye too learned something.\n Comment: Probably a screen reader. iPhones can do it if you just go in to accessibility.\n Comment: Sebeeku\n Comment: You best beelieve.\n Comment: My favorite kind!\n Comment: The simplest explanation. Honeybees live to do two things. Make honey and make babies. Only adult bees eat honey. They have to make royal jelly and bee bread (fermented pollen) for the larva. They can become honey bound. It's exactly as it sounds. They make so much honey that they have used up all the space they have. They need to make babies consistently to keep their numbers up, since their life cycles are so short. If they become honey bound, they will abscond (leave) the hive and go make a new one. They leave behind the majority of the honey. They will make more wherever they go. Pulling honey is part of a healthy hive maintenance schedule. Too much honey can cause pests and predators. I have had bears get through my electric fencing and they don't eat the honey, they eat the brood. They are looking for protein. I'm sure some would but my experience is always them eating the brood and adulterating the honey.\n Comment: Sounds like a Pixar movie.\n Comment: Ice age but it’s bees.\n Comment: I was just watching them doing me favors in my veggie garden earlier today, I don't want Beetis and Beearnice to die.\n Comment: i think those are usually bumblebees, not honey bees, and they are sleeping\n Comment: Yes. That is for native pollinators. If you are in North America, there are around 5,000 native bees. I believe there are around 20,000 native bees worldwide. Many are very tiny, some look like wasps. Bees aren't the only pollinators though. Many beetles, flies, wasps, \"pest species\" we don't like, moths, and apparently fucking mosquitos are pollinators.\n Comment: Bees are easily the most complex and interesting insects. The hive is basically a multi-multi-cellular organism.\n Comment: They also dance!\n Comment: There's a lot of interpretive dancing involved as well.\n Comment: “So I says to Paulie, I says ‘The queen is about to sleep with the fishes.’”\n Comment: No committees, they just stab her in the back.\n Comment: You can buy mated queens. There are people/companies that specialize in it. There are also some beekeepers who \"grow queens\". You also need to \"grow\" drones to do that. It's basically breeding. There are queen boards and drone boards that people use. People mate certain drones and virgin queens together. Hives always want to split. It's a way to stay healthy and get new genetic material for the hive. Humans have figured out how to do it commercially. I've never done that. I did open a hive in my first year that had 14 queen cells going at the beginning of February. That was a surprise. I was able to split it into five hives.\n Comment: >They make a ball around her and it increases the temperature until she ~~suffocates~~ cooks to death and dies.\n\nIt's even more metal then you said\n Comment: I could be wrong but I think she lays fertilized eggs until she dies after her initial mating flight. I say this because as far as I know if an accepted queen leaves the hive the workers typically follow which creates a swarm. Swarms happen when a new queen is crowned and the bees decide to create a new hive elsewhere. I know a little about bees from family members who raise them but I’m no expert by any stretch. \n\nSomeone correct me if I’m wrong.\n Comment: i thought bees only live for a few months based on what other people said, how does the queen live so long?\n Comment: TIL Bee Gang bangs.\n Comment: So queens can live up to 6 years but workers only 6 weeks?  Or did I misunderstand?\n Comment: Exactly. She is the only one that can lay. Workers, which are female can't lay normally. There is a thing called a laying worker. When a hive is queen less and can't make a new one queen, you can get a laying worker and it's not good. Laying workers can only create drones since they don't have the genetic material available from a mating flight to create workers. The hive can not survive a laying worker. There are always exceptions but this is basically the rule. If you have a laying worker that the hive has accepted, there are big problems.\n Comment: This. I didn't realize ants had a similar system but it makes sense.\n Comment: I’m trying to stay in character but that’s a really accurate estimation of what is happening here.\n Comment: Kamikabee\n Comment: Oh, do beehave\n Comment: Ahh. Really appreciate the replies. \nMakes sense regarding the bears. They’re going for salmon before berries, I’d imagine. \nThe bear sweet tooth for honey is a great trope though. \nThe honey production makes sense too. \nThey’re busy as bees, not kicking back when they’re sated. \nThanks again.\n Comment: nothing tastier than a mouthful of bees\n Comment: Finding Beemo\n Comment: Uhh Beevis uh huh huh\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Some mosquitoes like flowers or people.\n Comment: What about ants?\n Comment: 🎶💃 we’re gonna kill the queen today, we’re gonna kill the queen today 🕺🎶\n Comment: Think Dieter, but in bee form.\n Comment: Et tu brute?\n Comment: What were they going to do with all those Queens? 😂\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Wait until you learn bee *themed* gang bangs.\n Comment: You're a kind soul. Don't feel bad, it was simply funny\n Comment: Actually, it turns out it's [berries before salmon] (https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21082017/alaska-grizzly-bears-salmon-berries-climate-change-ecology-shift-study/).\n Comment: ***SPICY***\n Comment: WALL-BEE, The Incredibees, Ratatouibee\n Comment: An adventure time episode\n Comment: No you are totally right to hate mosquitoes they still are one of the number one killers of humankind with all the diseases they spread\n Comment: They’re food for frogs too! (And other insect eating animals) still tho, i wish i could burn them at once\n Comment: Ants are absolutely fascinating too, but I’ve always just been more interesting in bees. I think it’s cause they’re fuzzy bois.\n Comment: Ants are closely related to bees. They're part of a group of insects called [Hymenopterans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoptera).\n Comment: Colony ants in general will die if the queen dies and there aren't already other queens available like in a super colony. Honey bees still have a chance since queens aren't specifically born like they are with ants. Queen bees are sorta made/nurtured which adds a layer of complexity. Stuff like that pops up a lot when comparing ants and bees. Personally I find ants more interesting but I'd also agree that bees are probably even more complex than ants.\n Comment: Eu tu bee-te*\n Comment: Without human interference usually the first virgin queen to emerge will go around killing the unemerged virgin queens while they are still in their cells. If multiple queens emerge at the same time they fight each other until only one remains. (edit: they kill using their stingers BTW, unlike worker bees queens have a smooth stinger and can thus sting multiple times without injuring themselves).\n\nAlthough sometimes the bee hive remains in swarm mode even after the main swarm with the old queen has left (which happens shortly before the virgin queens emerge). In this case the worker bees prevent the queens from fighting and one or more of the virgin queens leave the hive together with so called afterswarms (or cast swarms).\n Comment: Hold a pageant?\n Comment: New season of Drag Race\n Comment: ah, so just like the queen of england they get to live way longer than everyone else",

[This](https://youtu.be/SyPjwxHxbus) is probably closer to what they think of the situation.\n Comment: Didn't know people (vegans) had a problem with beekeepers\n Comment: Honey can technically be considered vegan, as the argument for BEING vegan is that the animal can't consent to having their products used, but bees ACTUALLY CONSENT by living in the hives. If a hive doesn't like their keeper, they LEAVE.\n Comment: They make the honey, and we make the money.\n Comment: I'm a beekeeper and it would be better described as bee management. Honey bees produce more honey than they will eat which is why they have been used for honey production for centuries. But I never take all their honey, they have to eat it in the winter to stay alive. If I take it all then I will have to feed them more than I already do.\n Comment: It really has BEEn the best trade deal. \n\nOkay I’ll see myself out.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Arent honey bees an invasive species in most areas and  kill off the native pollinators in the region\n Comment: How can they freely leave if the queen can't leave? \n(im pretty sure that beekeepers do something to prevent queens from leaving.)\n Comment: my dad is reqlly into bee keeping and has around 100 hives and a couple things i leqrnt from helping him is that if you dont take the honey out of the hive they wont have any space to make more honey so they would move out and that endagers them since they can get deisies more easily ouside also if you dont take the honwy out of the hive pre winter when you comeback after winter the hive will be cover with bee diarhea since all they ate was honey for a couple months and its a bit to strong for there stomachs this doesnt happen durring the summer cuz they eat other stuff during the summer to prevent the diarhea and dieses they get from a dirty hive we give them sugar syrup which is much lighter and thats how we evade honey with shit amd diesed bees so in the ebd the bees living a better life than us in the end not eating honey and beeing anti honey is not very vegan since the point of vegans is that animals live in the best possible manner\n Comment: The hate for vegans has been getting real on here lately. I hope everyone knows that not every vegan is obnoxious.\n Comment: This Reddit vegan hating is getting really obnoxious - you’re stereotyping a group based on the actions of a few.  There are so many over-the-top muscle head meat eaters that won’t shut up about how they just shot 8 deer over the weekend.  Shoving your lifestyle on anyone is bad, we need to stop making generalizations.\n\nBottom line, everyone should be more accepting.\n Comment: Honey is less than 0.01% the reason I'm vegan. I'd much rather people stop using palm oil even though it's technically vegan. But if we're commenting about how our honey consumption effects this incredibly important species population in a positive way, we should also recognize how overfarming and land usage mostly going towards the ultimate goal of meat production is the major problem leading to bees becoming endangered.\n Comment: Can’t wait for my grandkids to analyze this meme in History class during the Global Warming unit\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Is it relatively small?

Ew, I have a custom made hive with honeycooling, get on my level”\n Comment: Might I also point out that honey bees compete for resources with native bees. \n\nHoney production ~= bee conservation. \nNative Wildflowers and grasses = bee conservation.\n Comment: Beekeepers are the best, especially when the homies can come over\n Comment: Given that the crux of Vegan living philosophy is that it is wrong to take from animals without their consent or abuse them to any degree, I submit that honey, while an animal product, is in fact vegan. Bees are able to consent to being on an apiary, considering that they can and do leave bad beekeepers and there is literally nothing the beekeeper can do to stop it. They'd basically be trying to catch wind. Additionally, bees actually benefit from having some of their honey taken, as they often overproduce which can lead to issues in the hive later down the line. Finally, while there are ways to have an apiary and abuse the bees, those methods are guaranteed to kill the hive, so if you try them, you likely won't be in the business for long. You can also go into any business and abuse animals or people, and there are usually ways to avoid these companies both as a company or as a consumer. Therefore, honey should be classified as vegan in my mind.\n Comment: I don't think any vegans think that but what ever\n Comment: Aaaaand this is the plot of the bee movie\n Comment: Half. Beekeepers take half the honey. You also tend to kill between 10 and 12 bees every time you open the hive, the sliding panels inevitably crush some.\n Comment: Bees literally have a trade monopoly with humans.\n Comment: It would be better if we went back to harvesting the honey in the spring when we knew that the bees no longer needed all that extra honey. We especially switch to harvesting in the fall once industrial sugar became available, initially from grapes. And so began the practice of feeding bees industrial sugar through the winter and cold months and taking much more than just a small fraction of their honey. You can most definitely raise bees without giving them fake honeycomb, without giving them premade honeycomb, and without feeding them industrial sugar which does not have all the fabulous properties of actual honey.  The reason industrial honey production does those things is to eke out every last drop for money. This is why industrial honey should be avoided.\n Comment: These vegans have clearly not seen the bee movie\n Comment: As a Vegan I'm not offended nor do I care what other people eat.\n Comment: Vegans have never seen Bee Movie\n Comment: I ain't vegan but I always understood it a simple 'is this product made using an animal?' and a follow up 'can I live without it?'\n\nI've never heard of people campaigning against the beekeeping industry.\n Comment: Pretty sure the vegans have a problem with the Queen bee being kept captive in the hive, not the worker bees that are free to come and go. The queen is usually kept in a compartment in the hive in which she cannot leave as well as sometimes having her wings clipped.\n Comment: I am vegan, and i don't have any problem with bee keeping.\n Comment: Yeah that’s what anti-beekeeping vegans don’t understand, is that the bees CHOOSE to live in the humanbuilt hive. They can leave literally whenever they want, there is absolutely nothing stopping the hive from relocating from a honey farm. They stay because for them, the numerous huge benefits outweigh the costs of having some excess honey siphoned.\n Comment: So let me explain the issues I have with honey. A common misconception is that the honey industry will keep pollinators in nature and save a number of flowers and plants. This is simply untrue. Let me explain. The honey bee population is a single species of bee, and this has terrible consequences for the environment. The honeybee is a species of bee that is particularly good at collecting nectar and bringing it back to the hive. These bees will go to one flower, collect nectar, and bring it back.\n\nThis causes a few problems but the greatest are these:\nFirstly, the honeybee isn't actually pollinating very well. These bees are so good at going out and getting nectar that they actually go to fewer flowers than wild bees, and this means they aren't spreading pollen around. \nSecondly, because these bees are kept in large numbers and they take as much nectar from the surrounding area as possible, this will out-compete the local wild bee populations. As a result, many bee species and wild flower species are coming closer to extinction.\n\nFinally, the way most bees are kept on bee farms. I am aware this doesn't apply everywhere, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Bees are artificially inseminated with semen from a crushed male bee. The queen bee's wings are clipped so she can't fly away. Often, when the bees need to be disposed of, the farmer will out a hive into a plastic bag and exterminate the hive by suffocating bees, or they will die from the heat.\n\nNow I haven't got a list of sources for you but all of these points are covered in this video, which does have sources:\nhttps://youtu.be/clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: are Bees animals?     Are insects considered animals?  \n\nIk ok I'm dumb please just answer\n Comment: Actually it's too good for the honeybees that the preferential treatment is fucking up other species of bees\n Comment: Beekeepers are brave and so good for the environment. I mean, they save bees which help the environment, boost our economy with honey sales, and they can touch thousands of bees and move them safely. Can you touch thousands of bees safely? Didn’t think so.\n Comment: Shit post... The poster obviously doesn't know anything about vegans just trying to get a rise\n Comment: I watched some video I cannot remember now but artificial beekeeping is really not good for environment as much people think it to be. Ill post link if I find it.\n Comment: Don't forget that bees also get free healthcare from their keepers, and also food and water in spring and autumn!\n Comment: Haha, fuckin vegans...\nWant to save the planet by not killing and exploiting cute animals.\n\nSo stupid...\n Comment: Yeah and we got S M O K E\n Comment: Also (atleast here in the Netherlands) we even give them a honey substitute\n Comment: In all seriousness, we only think it’s bad because a lot of bees get injured as part of the process of harvesting\n Comment: Bees can, and do leave bad beekeepers. They have a choise\n Comment: Except when a disease or fungi hits the colony. Usually they just find a new place to live. In commercial set ups the Holocaust every bee so it doesn’t spread to the other colonies.\n Comment: i read a likke 5 foot long tumblr post where some dumb ass vegan was trying to convece people that honey was un ethical and honestly they just fell flat on their face trying to defend their point\n Comment: Regenerative farming > going vegan.\n Comment: Yah, sure, what about seriously educating yourself on the subject instead of doing so on r/dankmemes ?  \n\n[Omnis are a joke](https://i.imgur.com/9nufm9F.jpg).\n Comment: tell that to the bees who are systematically gassed during the winter when they arent productive or the bees who in the trucks as they get shipped in perilous conditions and the generally shitty conditions MOST are kept in. like if ur gonna be making a meme that deals with a delicate subject matter do the fucking research lol\n Comment: Wow, that's actually a pretty great deal if not the best the bees will get\n Comment: What? really event with bee?\n\nWhat next? A salmonella right act?\n Comment: Yeah the only *beef* I have with vegans is that animals like bees, sheep, and dairy cows are actually really well taken care of and produce more than what they need. Bees will go mad with too much honey too. Otherwise I don't mind them and there are just radicals like thatveganteacher that ruin their reputation just as any group has\n Comment: what, vegans hate bee escape?\n Comment: reminds me of the vegan girl from a jubilee video\n Comment: I haft to agree with trump on this one\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: We need to make it clear that beekeeping is very very good\n Comment: Let us not forget The Bee Movie. If we let the bees take a vacation from what they do, then vegans will literally die because the bees aren’t pollinating their dire consumption plants. Smh\n Comment: they can leave whenever they feel right?\n Comment: Wait vegans are fucking crying about keeping bees? A practice that is good for the environment and good for the hive? Wtf is this bullshit?\n Comment: Vegans are idiots. Without bees everyone will die. Bees are currently declinimg since 2006 so we need to help them boost population as much as we can. Humans are merely nothing compared to the efficiency of the bees polinating.\n Comment: I don't want to see that losers face anymore.\n Comment: Did the bee movie teach us nothing?\n Comment: But the Bee movie made it look like it was a bad thing\n Comment: Tell those people to buzz off\n Comment: Akshully the colonies die relatively early and it’s not self sustaining anymore. They can’t fix their dying population because the „small amounts“ is a shitload. Remember the dying bees all over the country a couple of years ago: farmers, roundup and beekeeper unite\n Comment: Such an stupid argument\n Comment:  But this implies the bees are stupid and getting ripped off.\n Comment: It's actually a relatively large amount, and commercial beekeepers care more about profit than about the bees themselves, so they will kill of half the hive or even an entire hive if they need to.\n Comment: The only thing is the smoking\n\nThat is the only cruel thing and some beekeepers don’t eveb do that\n Comment: vegans bad.\n Comment: Stop using this man in memes. Keep him out of all media.\n Comment: The bees we use for honey are usually not wild bees like the ones that are responsible for pollinating. These honey bees, like most farmed animals, are bred in a way that is most profitable for humans, not for nature. These bred honey bees also tend to drive out the wild bees which is not helpful at all.\n\nFurthermore, in industrial beekeeping, beekeepers will prevent the hive from swarming out by clipping the queen's wings. Hives are often culled before the winter because it's cheaper to start with a new hive in spring rather than keeping the hive alive.\n\nAlso, in industrial honey production, they don't just take a small amount of honey, that wouldn't be profitable at all. Honey is food for the bees and it contains everything that is essential for them. Industrial beekeeping alternatively feeds them sugary water which is doesn't contain the same essential nutrients. Due to this and the breeding for profit, these bees are also more likely to get sick and spread diseases and parasites which also endangers the wild bee population.\n\nNature needs a variety of pollinators, not only honey bees, but by supporting businesses that depend on honey bees, you're not doing much good.\n\nAnd we don't need honey to survive, the bees need it more and we can just profit from all the plant-based food that they indirectly provide with their pollination.\n\nPlease note, that I'm not talking about hobby beekeepers, but they might also contribute to some of the above problems. Wanna help the bees? Think of their needs and interests and don't take their honey in return when they already ensure our entire species' survival with their pollination.\n Comment: Wait I never knew vegans didn’t like beekeepers? Seems a bit overzealous\n Comment: What fraction of vegans are retarded like this? 1/3 or 1/2? More?\n Comment: I am, honestly, not surprised at this point. Seeing as the vegans get triggered by anything.   \nEdit: Seeing the downvotes proves my point.\n Comment: Using Trump to denote that a deal is good is sort of like using fire marshall Bill to say something isn't flammable.\n Comment: Exactly! That’s why I buy houses for homeless people, and once they fill it with stuff, I steal it all! Silly vegans! If you give somebody shelter, then you can take whatever you want from them\n Comment: Nothing is as true as this right here\n Comment: Dont you think farm animals get the same? Predator free environment where they can thrive, get to eat as much as they can, are vaccinated against diseases, have offspring and as a trade for that is they get turned to burgers? You have to understand in the wild 80% would have been killed earlier than we make burgers out of them, due to infant mortality, diseases and predatorship, here they will all get to a decent age before paying the price for it\n\nNow not condoning bad conditions, animals should be farm-bred and free range to offer comfort...also trust me the meat is tastier, but you simply need to be prepared to fork out more cash...but once animals get that humane treatment, I see no issue in burgers\n Comment: That's fucking great.\n Comment: Can confirm, am beekeeper\n Comment: Wtf that’s in my liked playlist\n Comment: You, my friend, are a great human being, and you’ve made my day\n Comment: They’re real obnoxious sometimes.\n Comment: Can you beelieve it?\n Comment: someday people on internet will understand that vegans are not a single entity and it's a community with different set of ideas and individual beliefs. just like redditors\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\nSadly they feel the obligation for the sake of bees and the environment.. :/\n Comment: Most really don't. Reddit just likes to create strawmen in their heads to get mad at\n Comment: You're an idiot if you think vegans have a problem with beekeepers. You literally base your beliefs on the title of a meme? Vegans just don't eat honey for the most part as it's an animal product. That's all.\n Comment: I have been vegan for 3 years and it’s mostly diet related. I have zero issues with bee keeping. Fake news.\n Comment: They just think any use of animal produced food is immoral.\n\nI can at least understand the perspective that eating meat is inhumane but honey? Eggs? My family had chickens and let me tell you they could not give 2 fucks. They get to roam around for 90% of the day and are only forced to stay inside when it's night time, they then get a prepared enclosure that's nice and warm and protects them from Predators.\n Comment: I think it mainly had to do with how they are smoked to calm them down when it comes to collecting the honey and stuff.\nThere are ways to do it without smoking out the bees though.\n Comment: If you find two vegans ask them about bees and beekeeping. It is shocking controversial. Honey is bee vomit and us eating honey helps them. But... honey is an animal by-product and should not be consumed. Then it opens up other cans of worms like milk and cheese. If honey is okay for vegans then milk should be okay as well. Beekeepers pretty much hold a queen bee hostage. But once again, this helps the bees.\n Comment: ive heard of some vegans not eating food that was pollinated by captive bees\n Comment: *cough* People who don't like invasive species *cough*\n Comment: Vegans are against any animal products used commercially by humans. So ofcourse they're against honey\n Comment: Vegans have problems with vegans.\n Comment: I wonder what they don't have problems with...\n Comment: They have a problem with anyone.\n Comment: Vegans have a problem with everything\n Comment: New vegan here. Still learning things. Beekeeping IMO is fucking awesome. Eating honey is not awesome. Bees are my friends, not my slaves. On the scale of all things 'animal cruelty' it's nearly negligble, but there's no harm in giving up honey to be honest.\n Comment: They have problems with beekeepers when they are bored, which is all the time apparently\n Comment: Here is something you should read. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarming\\_(honey\\_bee)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarming_(honey_bee))\n\nYou can prevent bees from leaving their hive rather easily. Have a nice evening.\n Comment: >but bees ACTUALLY CONSENT\n\nUnzips*\n Comment: Vegan isnt about consent. Its about whether or not it comes from an animal. If a vegan finds a cow thats happy to gives its milk she still couldnt drink it because it comes from an animal\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\nIt’s a lot more complicated than that\n Comment: I heard they rip the wings of the queen so she can't leave. And are you really convinced that any animal has the perspective to leave if it is being exploited? That's ridiculous. Even humans stay in abusive relationships sometimes.\n Comment: Most vegans don’t make their argument about consent, they make their arguments about harm and to harvest honey you have to gas with the bees with potent nicotine until they literally pass out or are to lethargic to do anything about it.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: “They make the honey and we make the money???”\n Comment: How much of this video is true?

I’ve met (actually spoken to) two fellow vegans during this time (not counting my wife) and never have I ever seen an obnoxious vegan yelling at anyone about veganism. I have only seen videos from the US, which is already a place where everything is over the top. I live in Finland and even in here people say that all vegans are pushing their agendas every chance they get and throwing blood on people etc., just because of these videos from the land of the free basically. It’s weird man.\n\nI have chose to be sort of a closet vegan. I never tell anyone what I am eating, only my closest friends know. The word vegan is the last thing I want to say out loud anywhere.\n Comment: Reddit (and people in general) hate vegans because they know being able to get a $1 mcchicken requires a chicken to live in a cage barely bigger than its body, get pumped full of hormones and antibiotics, get de-beaked so it doesn't peck itself to death, and basically go insane and experience torture for its entire lifetime.\n\nMost people realize this on a deep level, but it makes them very uncomfortable to think about, because to do anything about it would be to massively increase the costs or inconvenience of their lives, and they're not willing to do that.\n\nBut then they see people who are actually making that choice, who are inconveniencing themselves to prevent this suffering, and it reflects badly on their own unwillingness to do that and increases their cognitive dissonance, so they attack these people. They make fun of them and act like they're some sort of crazy extremists or whatever they need to think other than \"this is a person who takes responsibility for the damage they're doing to animals and I am not\"\n\nEdit: And before you say anything stupid in response, I'm not a vegan. I eat $1 mcchickens. But I'm not in denial about it. This is a moral failure on my part, and I am causing suffering. I don't attack vegans to feel better about myself.\n Comment: >\\- you’re stereotyping a group based on the actions of a few.\n\nThis is literally Reddit.\n Comment: Exactly. Two things that Reddit hates is vegans, and PETA.\n Comment: everyone is already too accepting\n Comment: Welcome to earth people do that a lot. People are so obsessed with a view point and would want to stop generalising ‘my’ value but do it to others unconsciously. It’s an impossible task to change.\n Comment: You're absolutely right about overfarming, and non-sustainably produced palm oil is bad, but that last point needs to be nuanced -  lots of people seem to think palm oil is bad, period. It's not, quite the opposite. It's by far the most land-efficient vegetable oil-crop, and uses way less pesticides and fertilizer than any other oil-producing crop. The problem is that there is no good certification process for ecologically produced palm oil, so it's impossible to buy the \"good\" stuff. The one that kind of exists today is totally corrupt, and so much of the oil comes from land where ecologically sensitive mangrove or rain-forest has been burned and cleared to make way for farming.\n\nWhat we need to do as consumers is bring pressure to bear to institute a good certification process for ecologically produced palm oil, at which point it would be by far (like, by a lot) the most environmentally friendly vegetable oil available.\n Comment: We own a hay farm that supplies hay to the dairy's that you despise so much, but we keep honeybees on some of our fields, it helps the grass and any surrounding crops.\n\n^(And the boxes look purty lol)\n Comment: So far this comments section has been “don’t bother with beekeeping, because it’s the wrong type of bee”.\n\nLike, I’d rather have any bees at all than no bees.\n Comment: In fact not. We only breed honey bees, which endangers our overall bee population even more since they are highly susceptible to certain parasites. Example source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa\\_destructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa_destructor)\n\nWild bees are rather resistant in comparison, but can't compete with honey bees for habitats. Also, wild bees are way more efficient in pollinating, whilst honey bees, as the name suggests are bred for honey production. So in increasing the number of honey bees in our fields, we decrease the number of the ecologically better wild bee. (Pls pardon my English and have a nice evening.)\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\nIt’s actually not, unfortunately that’s a major misconception\n Comment: Actually not. \n\nBee keeping only keeps one species, the honey bee. Wild bee species are much more numerous and diverse, and they're outcompeted by honeybees.\n Comment: Couple things. \n\nFirst, you need to know the structure of the bee hive. The square boxes you see (mostly in the US, other parts of the world have different standards but similar concepts) is called a Langstroth hive. The bottom box is called the brood box and the top (or top 2, depending on the strength and age of the hive) are called supers. Bee keepers almost never pull honey frames from the brood box, the only time they tend to disturb those frames is for wellness checks (looking for Veroa or other mites mostly). The supers are usually all honey frames and are only honey frames if they are using a queen excluder. All a queen excluder does is prevent the queen from walking up to the super so she can’t lay eggs there. \n\n\nSecond, it depends on the time of year. Bee keepers will often take more at the start of the year (depending on climate there can be ~3 harvests per year). In the beginning of the year the bees don’t need a lot of honey and if you let them gather too much the hive will split and one half will swarm and fly away. But as it gets toward the end of the year bee keepers will leave more honey (ex only harvesting one super instead of 2) so that they have enough honey for the winter. \n\n\nThird, honey bees have been bred for thousands of years by humans to be absolute bad asses at making honey. Just like how sheep have been bred to produce more wool than they need bees have been bred to produce more honey than they need to survive. \n\nFourth, and most importantly. Bee keepers care about their bees. Not only are the bees an investment for them. Keepers often get really attached to their bees. They wouldn’t do anything to hurt them intentionally and if they make a mistake and pull too much honey the keeper can feed the bees sugar water and pollen to keep them alive.\n Comment: Depends on the hive. It's sort of like tapping a maple tree, we take all that we can and stop just before it affects the tree's health.\n Comment: The uncle's organic bee farm lmao.\n Comment: “Increasing the presence of honeybees due to human beekeeping in natural areas (and also in nearest mass-flowering crop areas because of spillover of honeybees) can negatively affect the biodiversity of wild pollinators, ecosystem functioning, and ultimately their resistance to global environmental change”\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41271-5\n\n\nAnd there is another article in Scientific America on this.\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\nBee movie is dank tho\n Comment: Thank god\n Comment: I'm a feminist but if other people want to be sexist to women I don't really care. Live and let live!\n Comment: According to all known laws of aviation\n Comment: Give a bee too much rights and he will fuck your wife \n-Bee movie\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: Queens are not kept in compartments in the hive that is a misconception. When queens are reared they are put into a compartment with a sugar gate. By the time they eat through the sugar they are completely free to move around the hive as they need. How do you think queens lay eggs if they are kept in a compartment? They cant just telepathically lay eggs don’t be ridiculous. \n\nAlso wing clipping is not a normal practice. If a hive decides to swarm then they are simply caught by the beekeeper.\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: They are in kingdom Animalia yes.\n Comment: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect)\n\nThey're part of the Animalia kingdom.\n Comment: Sorry, this sounds interesting. Do you have any sources? I’d love to read.\n Comment: Bees aren't a delicate subject matter, you fragile fuck.\n Comment: \"systematically gassed\" you realize that's more expensive than just either letting the bees die from the cold or keeping them so you don't have to get a new hive the next year? You probably also support Peta and think you're such a great person because you harass people like farmers for having lifestock.\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: Okay I seriously seriously challenge/beg you to watch three things. I used to be pretty anti vegan and have eaten tons of meat for most of my life until I saw Cowspiracy (on Netflix), Dominion (free online just look up dominion documentary) and then watch this 6 min YouTube video to understand how bee keeping is a lot more complex than you think it is, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\nThere’s a multi billion dollar industry and a lot of propaganda wanting you to not question killing animals for taste but it’s very complicated and much much more serious than you think it is. Please please watch at least the first two I mentioned, education is the only hope in regards to these issues.\n Comment: I can talk about dairy cows since o honestly dont know that much about sheep and bees. When a dairy cow is born they get taken away from their Mother day 1. If its a male then its either killed early on or raised for meat. The female calf gets put in a small box for a few months to grow up(standard pratice). Then they impregnate the cow and start to process over again. Now the Mother cow has no baby, and an unatural high amount of milk production since we have bred cows to have produce an i sne amount of milk. The t hey repear the process every year untill the cow stops producing milk and the cow gets killed at around 5 years old since its seen as uselss to The farmers. Thats why vegans are against dairy.\n Comment: Yep, if you are getting grass-fed meat, they had a pretty good gig.  A nice warm barn, food provided, protected from predators and disease, nice pasture to roam around and eat.  Surely had a much better and enjoyable life than in the wild.\n Comment: Your source may have lied because bees only have 1 parent the queen.\n Comment: Since you deleted your comment u/Godlike_Blast58\n> The reason as to why vegans don't eat honey is because of how in many cases the queen bee gets her wings clipped off, the offspring is separated from their parents and there is a lot of neglect, not to mention that humans only breed honey bees which makes the entire bee population more susceptible to desease and parasites.\n\nWhat in gods name are you talking about? Bee offspring are separated from their parents? You understand that the queen bee is the only “parent”. She has one mating flight and stores sperm to lay eggs for the rest of her life. Nurse bees take care of the eggs until they are ready to hatch. The *entire* hive stays together with the queen. How does one even neglect bee babies? Literally the entire process is done within the hive. \n\nI have no issues whatsoever with vegans not eating honey or supporting poor bee tending practices. Just please for the love of fuck have some common sense and *think about these things*. \n\nAlso the wings can’t be clipped entirely off, or the hive would reject the queen and either die out or a new queen will be born. The very tip of one wing is trimmed. If too much is removed she *will* be rejected by the hive. The queen literally can’t function if she is missing an entire wing or both, and she will be viewed as damaged and disposed of by the hive.\n Comment: How do they think bees are separated from their parents? That doesn’t make any sense\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: No it isn't it destroys native bee populations\n Comment: Yeah just like when black people got triggered by slavery right! Snowflakes\n Comment: I'm gonna upvote you just for making an In Living Color reference probably none of these kids understood at all.\n\nAs a side note, have you tried watching that show recently? I did a couple years ago because I loved it so much as a kid, but aside from a few classic skits, that shit has aged like milk.\n Comment: You're terribly uneducated about beekeeping and the harvesting process lol\n Comment: Honestly, it's the bees paying their rent.\n\nThis really makes me feel like we live in a society.\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: Can confirm am bee\n Comment: Can also confirm. I too enjoy this fucking awesome hobby\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: While I love the idea of being able to have a natural bee population that is sustainable, it currently isn't possible, and I started the diet for health reasons, and we'll, I'm already doing the hard part, why not take the extra step and see what the life style of being vegan is all about. I am 100% on board with humane bee keeping, only taking what won't be used and treating the bees with the same respect that we would treat them with as if they were wild. It helps foster the bee population, and keep our gardens fruitful and the flower beautiful. It's not for everyone, but supporting humane treatment of animals is pretty cool, I understand asking a huge industry to just stop isn't going to work so maybe we can start with asking them to treat them well at least, and feed them well\n Comment: Yeah. Every time I meet new people there are two reasons I tend to avoid talking about the subject. It usually comes up as I keep when declining \"No thank you, I'm not hungry\" and \"Yeah, for real, I'm okay, the coffee is enough.\" They just want to know why and I get tired of avoiding the topic so I'll just say I'm vegan at that point.\n\n1. I've met some crazy ass vegans. I don't want to be associated with that.\n\nSomeone once told me that if you want to convince someone they're wrong, use words, not violence. While going batshit insane screaming at people's face isn't necessarily violent, I think it's close enough. And it's crazy. Just talk it out if someone is genuinely interested.\n\n2. People seem threatened by my choice. They need to convince me that I'm wrong because I chose different. \"Here's all the reasons I wouldn't ever be able to be vegan.\" I didn't ask and this topic is getting really old to have with everyone while nobody actually wants to talk about it. They just want to let me know how hard life would be on them as if I didn't go trough the same process. And my favorite; If I'd get a penny for each time someone asked if I'd \"eat an animal when stuck on a deserted island, no other food, no rescue coming\" yada yada, holy hell, I would get rich - fast.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't say being obnoxious is a vegan trait. It's fairly common people trait. Being vegan just attracts some of the more.. ermmm... passionate people. It's like I've been told that I'll go to hell for wearing black. That passion twists into obnoxious insanity at some point when you just keep going. Or something, I don't know.\n Comment: Beekeepers or vegans?\n Comment: Well it's commonplace for commerical beekeepers to kill the entire colony with cyanide at the end of the harvesting season so maybe it isn't that obnoxious to be upset about that\n Comment: The most obnoxious cunt I've ever known was a vegan I had to go to school with as an adult.\n\nOne of the unprompted and unwanted lectures she gave me while I was trying to eat my lunch was about how bees are slaves.\n Comment: Bees are not native to most of the places where they're raised. It might still be worth it but it can't be denied that invasive species are bad.\n Comment: Tell me about it. Knew this one that would write lengthy Facebook posts about the horrors of a mother (cow) when her kids are taken from her. But when her dog gave birth she gave away the puppies very quickly. Also she forced the dog to also become a vegan and said “well if she didn’t like the veggies, she wouldn’t eat them”. I don’t like vegetables but if I had no other option, I’d eat vegetables :/\n Comment: LOL *sometimes*?  There are no secret vegans.\n Comment: I’m a level 5 vegan, I don’t eat anything that casts a shadow.\n Comment: You're an idiot if you think vegans have a problem with beekeepers. You literally base your beliefs on the title of a meme? Vegans just don't eat honey for the most part as it's an animal product. That's all.\n Comment: \"They\" are not a monolith. Just like white people aren't, cat owners aren't, PC gamers aren't. All this generalisation is getting really annoying tbh.\n Comment: Bee queens get their fucking wings clipped so they can't escape. Why is wanting to end this cruelty obnoxious?\n Comment: I have a problem with the posts wording, if it was ‘obnoxious vegans’ instead of just vegans I would appreciate this post 2x more\n Comment: Did you know?\n\nAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.\n Comment: Just like any group created by arbitrary choosing non-criteria*\n\nReligious people think atheists are an entity, some people think vegans are.\n\nAtheists are the people who don't believe in a God, vegans are the people who don't eat animal products. You can't make a group by using the negation of a criteria. Non-pens are not a group, they are every item that is not a pen.\n Comment: wishful thinking\n Comment: Eating or not eating honey as a vegan can be debated, but the vast majority of eggs do not come from chickens in the conditions you described\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: In the egg industry male chickens are not needed and get shredded after they hatch.\n\nNot the result of a muscular workout shredded, but I’m talking about shredded like in a shredder.\n Comment: Veganst dont eat egs because male chicks gets killed day 1 because they are seen as uselss. Then the hens gets to live in cages for the rest of their life where they cant even strech their wings and where they produce unatural amount of eggs. Then after a few years thye killed killed because they stop producing eggs. Thats why vegans dont eat eggs.\n Comment: It is not even that they are forced to stay inside, I think they actually prefer it. Not sure if chickens know that they are safer that way but I think they know it is at least warmer and more comfortable.\n Comment: > My family had chickens and let me tell you they could not give 2 fucks. \n\nWhere are their brothers?\n Comment: I think it has more to do with eggs taken by corporations, who don't tend to be very humane.\n Comment: The real problem it's not the animals, but how the human treat them. Home grown animals usually lives hundred times better than industrial ones. Not to talk about the violence that may happen on them.  \nStopping to eat animal products it's a way to send a message, and maybe reduce the request of dairy products on the market.\n Comment: I feel like that’s a really bizarre generalisation. There are a lot of different reasons a person might choose to be a vegan\n Comment: Honey is really bad for the bees as a whole: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=clMNw\\_VO1xo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=clMNw_VO1xo)\n\nTL;DW:\n\n1. bees have central nervous system, and bee keepers do bad things to them\n2. Honey bees are an invasive species outcompeting all the natural pollinators we need for a healthy flora\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Do they really keep them hostage? The apairy is open, isn't it? They are free to leave. But why should they? They get shelter and resources to build.\n Comment: Not only honey though. Commercial beekeeping is used to produce many vegetables as well like tomatoes, avocados, almonds etc. Farms will literally hire a beekeeper to bring their hive out to the farm to pollinate their crops and then pack them up and move on to the next farm.\n\nSo if you’re really gonna be adamant about honey like that I expect you to shun all forms of bee exploitation.\n\nAlso, if you care about bees you should probably care about wasps as well. You should know that every single fig has a dead wasp inside it.\n Comment: How does us eating honey help the bees???\n Comment: That’s dumb. Unless they are kept in an enclosed greenhouse Bees aren’t captive if they can pollinate.\n Comment: Its not slavery tho. Its mutualism, bees and humans benefit from beekeeping. Did you even read the post?\n Comment: You can but you still can have vegan honey by simply not doing this, no?\n Comment: What if you just.... don't... do that?\n Comment: I wish a pleasant evening for all bee's appreciators\n Comment: Well, that's the wrong reason to be vegan lol\n Comment: That practice was an uncommon thing way back in the day, but it's highly frowned upon now\n Comment: Not everyone smokes bees.\n Comment: “Extremely common?” You sure about that? Everything I can find when I look into it says that it fell out of vogue years ago\n Comment: Yeah this just plain wrong. Queen bees won’t leave their hive unless they are a virgin queen looking to mate or if the hive has outgrown its space. Under normal circumstances, a healthy queen just eats and grows the hive.\n Comment: Where are you getting that it's still extremely common? In a simple Google search, I've found that people were protesting slipping the wings from 5 years back, and a beehive business owner saying that he finds it's no longer common to do. Stop talking out of your ass. \n\nAnd to add onto this, in my experience, beehives aren't confined, they aren't trapped, and the bee's are allowed to leave anytime they like if they think they would be better off somewhere else, but they don't. It doesn't hurt the bee's to take their honey if you're doing it right.\n Comment: That's just simply not true.\n Comment: an uneducated elitist, the worst kind\n Comment: What's next? The bees need to have insurance, a company car, and a matched 401k?\n Comment: In my few years of working with bees from a few of the big beekeepers in my state I hadn’t seen that once.\n Comment: Oh, my!\n Comment: Its called being a shareholder sweetie look it up\n Comment: Some of it is but I have never seen anyone cull a hive, most beekeepers that I know will make efforts to save them sometimes by requeening. I do know some that will clip the queens wings to keep them from swarming but I haven’t. I have had them swarm but I try to split them before they do. The parasites they mentioned don’t have to do with weakened immune systems and they have tried to develop bees that are resistant to it and most beekeepers treat for varroa.\n Comment: This is kinda pushing the idea that we wouldn’t bother with beekeeping because “it’s the wrong bee”.\n\nBut there comes a point where I’d rather we have any bee population at all than no bees.\n Comment: It is a conspiracy by big honey\n Comment: What the shit, I'm a beekeeper but I never heard of this. If you take good care of your hive they will never leave.\n Comment: yup lmfao\n Comment: If you know how bad it is, why not go vegan?\n Comment: I want to be vegan but I'm just not in a situation where that is possible at the moment. For me the main want to be vegan is the environment 1st then moral 2nd then health 3rd which are kinda the big 3 reasons.  \n\nThe waste we produce growing food to feed to cows and pig is huge and I'd rather not be apart of that. \n\nMoral is slightly weaker for me since I don't care if a chicken has a bad life but I still want it to live a happy life so it's just a bonus to being vegan in my eyes. \n\nAnd heath is not a reason for me since I'm perfectly fine with eating meat so why change.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: PETA is hated for good reason at least\n Comment: Fuck PETA though\n Comment: Uh, ok?\n Comment: yeah, this is the biggest reason I don't eat honey as a vegan, second being [this entire video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo). This whole thread is full of people who don't realize this stuff, and of course vegans are the bad guys. Don't support bad industries, and go look up native plants that attract bees and buy some to help your local wild bee bros!\n Comment: The problem is that videos like that can sometimes be misleading.\n\nFor example, one of the clips they used of a guy killing bees of with soapy water is because that hive was extremely aggressive. Like it would literally sting people and animals passing by the road nearby and it was becoming a problem. If you watch the video you can tell the guy is not happy about euthenizung the hive and he wishes he didn't have to do it, but it really was the right decision given how problematic the bees were.\n Comment: The agriculture industry would be dealt an enormous blow if commercial beekeepers weren't around for pollination. Stop posting your dumb cherrypicked shit in r/dankmemes, this is why vegans are hated.\n Comment: Goddammit... then what the duck do we do?\n Comment:  Very informative video, I can’t believe how effectively an industry has swayed public opinion to their favor, unironically including The Bee Movie. The upvote ratio on the post and many of the comments also reflect this \n\nactually I can believe that, this happens constantly everywhere\n Comment: It advocates for the fact that communism just makes everyone a dumbass.\n Comment: You are the annoying annoying vegan people make fun of here.\n Comment: there is no way a bee should be able to fly\n Comment: Not a single thing mentioned in the video happens at small businesses.\n\nMaybe true for big industrial beekeeping. But I have never seen or heard about any of these and I worked as a beekeeper before at bigger and at smaller farms too. \n\nThe claim that beekeepers let the colony die during the winter is stupid, a colony costs around 100-200 USD, and insulating a hive is basically just putting a rag on it. \n\nNever heard about culling either, why would you kill $200 worth of bees when you can sell it?\n\nMites are a thing but getting rid of them is pretty easy\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: I’m no bee expert, just remembering what I’ve some vegans say in real life. Good to know how it actually works though, now I can stop being ridiculous.\n Comment: It takes 5 seconds to google clipping and see it’s an extremely common practice, especially in traditional or large scale bee farming. It keeps the queen from leaving and finding a new location for the hive or swarming, since they follow their queen.\n Comment: But i eat honey. Only egg and meat rejected\n Comment: Oh God\n Comment: That's exactly why I don't buy industrial honey.\n\nI only buy honey from independant productors who sold their honey in their own stands\n Comment: Yeah, except the life expectancy of a cow naturally is 18-20 years and for beef cows it's 18-20 *months*. So I don't think the cows will agree that their life ended at our equivalent of 6,5 years old is that chill and enjoyable.\n Comment: And then of course there’s the part where they are killed with a bolt gun at a very young age. But let’s just ignore that part ✨🐮✨\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\nNot defending that dude but just check out this video to understand most vegans’ perspective\n Comment: Oh yeah, it doesn't hit the same at all. Survivorship bias really helped keep that show alive for the fans.\n\nGotta just remember the good bits\n Comment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo\n Comment: Buzz buzz.\n Comment: Where are you located? I'm in central florida\n Comment: Don't worry. All the bees have great insurance and a 401k match.\n Comment: If I remember correctly the majority of dying out bees is wild solitary bees aka not the ones we keep inside an apiary so we don't really have a good way to replace them\n Comment: Is there an inhumane way to beekeep? Obviously if you take all the honey, the hive dies and this defeats the whole point of beekeeping.\n Comment: *bee*ing able\n Comment: Feel like beekeepers treat there bees with a greater respect since they rely on one another.\n Comment: I subbed to the vegan subreddit and its basically just hate towards everyone else. Who the fuck would want to join that cult. Start eating less meat etc is fine and all, but never ever would i have anything to do with someone as hatefull and annoying shits liek vegans are.\n Comment: Truer words have never been spoken. Please take my poor man's gold 🥇\n Comment: Why would you go to hell for wearing black?\n Comment: This, exactly this point. Thank you so much.\n Comment: People\n Comment: Why would they do this?\n Comment: Invasive species are only bad when they replace native ones or completely delete a link in a food chain. If they're not causing damage they tend to be very welcomed. There is a place I remember reading about where an invasive plant created a new ecosystem for a native bird to hide in. All in all a good thing.\n Comment: I wouldn't. Rather rude to be honest, disabled people also have rights you know.\n Comment: \"Name one cow you're friend with\" gets me everytime.\n Comment: >  Also she forced the dog to also become a vegan and said “well if she didn’t like the veggies, she wouldn’t eat them”.\n\nWell, I don't know about what she gives the dog, but if she feeds it vegan based food, it really doesn't matter if its vegan or not if it has the right nutrients. Same applies for humans. On the other hand, Just giving the dog vetatables like broccoli, carrots etc would be really hard to get right tho.\n Comment: That's because the guys who tested it were stupid and didn´t account for the frequency in which insect flap their wings. Also, the size of a bee is so small that their proportion to air is different. For them, the air feels thicker, like swimming for us. And last but not least, the air canals they used for testing don´t represent natural conditions and therefore can´t give precise results. (Pardon my English and a wonderful evening.)\n Comment: I’ve read this before and originally believed it. But like LukeniceLuke pointed out it was bad science. Many variables were not accounted for.\n Comment: Yellow, black. Yellow, black.\nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\n\n  \nOoh, black and yellow!\nLet's shake it up a little.\n Comment: According to laws of aviation all laws are bullshit or atleast the made up aviation's ones\n Comment: Yeah, no. Someone built a model of how they thought bees fly. The model indicated that the bees couldn't fly. They thought \"oh, we must've made a mistake in our model\", watched bees with slow motion cameras, and figured out that bees rotate their wings during the flap to generate extra lift, and then they corrected this model.\n\nThat's fine. That's how science works. You think you know how something works, you test it, it turns out you were wrong or incomplete, so you update your understanding. Turning this into \"lolol scientists don't think bees can fly!\" or even \"all laws of aviation say that bees can't fly\" is a nonsensical take on this.\n Comment: bee roccck!!\n Comment: One day I want to raise my own chickens. Did it as a kid before a racoon got to them all. Not only is eating their eggs guilt free if you treat them right, but its like a bunch of pets who feed you back. I think it is a great experience for kids to have, raising chickens.\n Comment: Sure, but you wont see vegans farming. You will see them in a 1st world country with a comfortable office job complaining.\n Comment: But there are indeed people with small farms that raise chickens like this. The same with my parents.\n Comment: Yeah but it's pretty easy to find free range eggs.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Also the fact that we've artificially bred chickens to lay eggs at an abnormally fast rate which I imagine isn't very comfortable.\n Comment: why not use hens for consumption tho?........why kill them on day 1?\n Comment: I mean, a lot of people only buy free range eggs which in my country means they are outside and have at least 2.5 m2 per hen.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I have yet to meet one person that doesn't like eating meat. There are people that hate liver or tongue (like me), but every vegetarian/vegan I met used to eat meat before and stopped for moral reasons.\n Comment: Definitely morally superior, thanks :)\n Comment: How could you misunderstand so strongly? Veganism is the belief that we should not harm others when we don’t have to. That is it.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Way to miss the point. Many vegans (myself include) agree that there are multiple issues with this\n Most importantly the issue with wild bees like wasps. Here is an article why it is not as simple as \"dumb vegans think bees have feelings\"\n https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/think-of-honeybees-as-livestock-not-wildlife-argue-experts\nIf you care about wild bees you shouldn't promote commercial bee keeping.\n Comment: We eat honey = there's demand for honey = people farm honey by providing bees with safe spaces to make their honey = bees prosper and have a much higher chance of survival than out in the wild or somewhere that would require humans to remove them.\n\nLook at every other species that humans farm for resources: their population numbers, evolutionarily speaking, are extraordinarily impressive. The main difference is that beekeeping isn't inhumane because the bees don't suffer any negative consequences from losing a portion of their honey; the entire operation is set up to make sure they prosper and continue to produce more. They're essentially paying a honey tax to have a safe place to live and pollinate.\n Comment: It's mutualism when it's your friendly neighborhood beekeeper but when you are buying commercial honey it's most economical to gas the entire colony and kill the bees between harvest seasons.\n Comment: What do they replace the honey with when it's taken?\n\nSugar syrup that doesn't have the same nutritional profile?\n Comment: Much like vegan wool, which is just straight-up plastic - the substitute is probably far worse for the environment than what it’s replacing.\n Comment: I guess it depends on the definition of vegan. Some say it's about strictly not consuming animal products, others would maybe define it as above. I just wanted to comment on the \"consent\" part, because, as shown in the article they do not automatically consent to give their honey, by staying. So no it has nothing to do with consent when bees don´t flee. (It also depends on strength of the hive, available habitats etc.)  What you make of that is your own thing.\n Comment: Yeah. Vegans sure don’t, but people who mass produce and sell honey sure do. Also your notion of consent is fundamentally flawed. You’re arguing that consent to be in a particular situation amounts to nothing more than not choosing to leave that situation. That would make slavery consensual in every case where the slave doesn’t decide to runaway. Merely choosing not to leave isn’t real consent. Consent involves at the very least an understanding of the situation, a will and means to remain in it or leave it. Bees have no understanding that their work is being harvested and sold for profit, even if veganism was concerned with animal consent your argument doesn’t really do much to counter the point bees aren’t consenting to their situation just in virtue of the mere fact that they don’t leave. Bee hives stay with their queen. If the queen is in one place and forced to stay there then the rest of the hive stays there too.\n Comment: Damn I wish I didnt give my free reddit inflation away\n Comment: Can confirm. Russian bees have a natural mite resistance.\n\nI keep bees myself, know several others personally, and have met with countless beekeepers at local events. I can say that there are exactly zero beekeepers who would just burn their shit because their bees weren't to their liking? This is a problem with the commercialization of honey bees - not the average beekeeper. At this point, i think both parties are being generalized in a negative way. If a vegan saw first-hand how I keep my bees, they would see that my bees are my little furry friends no different than a house pet like a dog or a cat; that my utmost goal is to NOT harm them.  In fact, I have gone out of my way to literally save their lives when I hived a swarm at dusk right before a cold snap.\n Comment: Same reason everyone else does - I love meat and other animal products and my life would be significantly worse without them.\n\nThe only difference is that I understand this, and I don't try to delude myself that it's anything else, and I don't try to attack people who are doing better than me. \n\nJust like I know I (as a person in the developed world) have a high environmental impact on the world and that I could reduce my impact by using less energy. But other than a few minor things, I largely don't. Because it would make my life worse, and I'm not willing to make that big negative impact on my own life in exchange for a minor positive impact in the world. But I don't attack people who take public transport or cut down their plastic usage or who are otherwise being better than the environment for me.\n Comment: What the fuck? Do you think vegans are committing hate crime against humans?\n\n\"I can't believe that doctors without borders exist, because who would ever help their fellow humans when other, totally unrelated humans have committed genocide\"?\n\nPeople aren't a hive mind. Most vegans are motivated by wanting to lessen suffering and lessen their impact on the environment. The people you describe - the ones who commit hate crimes - are at the opposite end of the spectrum of humanity in terms of their compassion, empathy, and desire to do good for the world.\n Comment: Yeah, I generally don't believe this. There are a few vegans that get in a stereotypical purity contest, but most of them are just minding their own business. This is the same argument people use against atheists. Hundreds of millions of people are atheists, but lots and lots of people hate atheists because supposedly they're all super aggressive militant atheists that get in everyone's face. It's bullshit. It's just one of the tactics demonize the group so that people can feel better about not considering why they believe what they believe. Deciding to think that all vegans are militant is part of that defense mechanism I described.\n Comment: Their goals are admirable but yeah, execution is not so great\n Comment: Eh, I don’t fucking despise it but it’s done some shitty things in the past(that guy’s dog). Most of the actual hate comes from complete ignorance.\n Comment: >we should also recognize how overfarming and land usage mostly going towards the ultimate goal of meat production is the major problem leading to bees becoming endangered.\n\nNot all farming is bad\n Comment: Good video. Makes me understand better ehy people choose to become vegan. \n\nI had a classmate who inssisted on meat was unnatural because we actually used to be vegan in the stoneage.\n\nShe was cool and all but people got tired of her quickly. It even pushed me further away from veganism. \n\nAnyways a bit of a rant there, point is its not, look at these poor baby cows but more; here is why this product harms and here is a solution\n Comment: As somebody who lives out in the UK countryside, ‘big honey’ (for lack of a better phrase) seems strange to me. There’s so many people around here who keep their own bees locally (and ethically) that I have never even seen a jar from a large business. Always buy local\n Comment: Best way to eliminate the bad actors is not to abandon the industry, but to support the good actors.\n\n*shock*\n Comment: Yeah but that’s not the point, native bees are going extinct.\n Comment: It seems like reddit beehive mind doesn't really hate vegans as you think lol\n Comment: No they wouldn't lol. How would that even work? \n\nThere are way more wild bee species that have pollinated plants since way before agriculture even existed.\n Comment: Google what flowers wild bees need and buy some seeds. :D\n\nWe are slowly transforming our foreyard into a bee paradise. It is not much, but a little bit here and there to support your local bees is helping. If you don´t have a garden you can just sow the seeds near fields etc. \n\nHave a wonderful bee saving day :)\n Comment: It's a badge of honor.\n Comment: Why downvoted? He is learned\n Comment: > It takes 5 seconds to google clipping and see it’s an extremely common practice, especially in traditional or large scale bee farming. It keeps the queen from leaving and finding a new location for the hive or swarming, since they follow their queen.\n\nIt does not prevent the queen from leaving, since the practice is to clip only one wing. The theory is that they wont fly *as far* during a swarm. If both wings were clipped the queens would not be able to navigate the hive, and they would just die. Your quick google search clearly wasn’t that insightful, and I think you probably should have spent a little more than *5 seconds* on it. Just because it shows up on a google search does not mean its an extremely common practice. There are many people who understand that clipping the queen endangers their life, because they are not able to balance properly with only one full wing, and can’t control themselves during falls.\n\nEdit: Also swarms will happen with or without a queen, and most beekeepers understand clipping is a stupid and harmful practice. I’ve spent time with the largest honey producer in my province, who teaches classes on how to properly keep bees. Guess what, they maintain thousands of hives yearly with no clipping. Clipping is not a necessary or common practice no matter what your 5 seconds of googling tells you.\n Comment: I took a 10 second google to find that clipping today isn't nearly as popular as it once was.\n\nEdit: If it only takes 5 seconds to google then why didn't you?\n Comment: You’re not a vegan then. You might like to be, but you’re not. That’s like saying “I’m a vegan but I dip my cheese in yoghurt while drinking milk”.\n Comment: Always happy to have a discussion! These issues are a lot more complicated than most realize, not all just a matter of how much pleasure your taste buds get. Just give me your opinion and logic and I’ll always be down to talk\n Comment: Much better to have their testicles torn off by wolves while they're still alive.\n Comment: Buzzz\n Comment: I live around Toronto area in Canada but I’m out a little east\n Comment: I thought bees adhered to monarchy\n Comment: They deserve it.\n Comment: Plus the bees we keep are an invasive species, so bee keeping is actually bad for the environment.\n Comment: Yeah most of the industry cuts the wings off the queen so she can’t move the hive, the smoke the use to knock the bees out to take the honey is harmful and incredibly stressful for the bees and they take 90%-100% of the honey and feed them sugar water which isn’t nourishing enough to keep them healthy\n Comment: Yes actually, back in the medieval time and in some third world countries the hives beekeepers use are called skeps. These are the dome shaped hive that’s woven out of straw or grass. The only way to get the honey out is to destroy all the wax the bees have built. This style of beekeeping is mostly illegal because it is inhumane.\n\nEdit:spelling\n Comment: Of course. We don’t hurt them we provide a good place for them and usually save them from being destroyed from public or private properties.\n Comment: 👉😎👉\n Comment: Part of the cult is being literate so goodbye.\n Comment: People or vegans?\n Comment: All from Googling:\n\nThe reasoning is to avoid concern about overwintering. The plan is to buy packages in spring, keep them as usual throughout the summer, then gas them in the fall and harvest all the honey. Store the equipment for next year's run. No worry about overwintering, no lost hives (per se). No sugar syrup to feed. No requeening. No treating.\n Comment: My understanding is that in order to let them survive over winter you have to warehouse the hives and leave honey in the combs so it's cheaper and you get better yields from just starting over each season.\n Comment: Ok that’s cool and all but that’s the script to the bee movie\n Comment: I don't think this is the correct explanation. For one thing, just because you have an incomplete model doesn't mean you're stupid, it means your hypothesis and methodology missed something. The people who are stupid are the ones saying \"scientists think bees can't fly!!!!\"\n\nSecond, the reason their model was incomplete was not because \"air is thicker for them\", I don't think that makes any sense at all, but because they didn't account for the way the bee rotated its wing during the flap, generating extra lift.\n Comment: Like how the scientists wife divorced him for a bee, starting his vendetta.\n Comment: I do and be careful it takes a ton of energy\n Comment: So what happens to your make chickens? What happens when they stop laying eggs? What are you doing about the fact that a chicken naturally lays 8-12 eggs a year and is breed to pay 300 which just demolishes their body.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Most of the people have no clue of their food's process at all. You don't see most people farming. What's the problem here? That people are striving to be better, based on what they value? \n\nPeople are complaining what horrors are going down in each and every country. Shit going down in China or North-Korea are some simple examples. And most of these people not liking it are in 1st world country, with the same comfortable office job. Most of these people are not out there trying to change things in said countries and it seems to be okay.\n\nSure, you could be holding the second group just as accountable, but I think you'd be in the vast minority in that case.\n Comment: So they choose not to eat eggs rather than start farming themself. I'm not a vegan but I would rather give up eggs than start a farm.\n Comment: That's the fucking point. We do not need to enslave animals to live a perfectly healthy and sustainable life.\n Comment: Only the douchiest of vegans would give you a hard time about that and they aren't worth talking to. It's factory farmers that are causing 99% of problems.\n Comment: Which country are you from if you dont mind me asking? From what I know most countries when they say \"free ranged eggs\" is basically just that they are not in cages anymore and they live in an overcrowded open area.\n Comment: No, ~~you can't~~ *it's uneconomical to* sex a chicken through the egg. Guess again.\n Comment: Vegan, raised vegetarian, tried to eat meat for a few months in college. I hated it and was never even able to get through a full portion before feeling sick. So we’re rare, but we exist. Hell, I can’t even really stomach some of the more meat-like vegan foods like impossible burgers.\n Comment: Thank you, was looking for this, or they get killed when a new queen is born so the hive can’t split.  All the people saying vegans have no issue with honey or just because it’s animal product, smh.\n Comment: This is only for one type of bee, the honey bee, which are not at all endangered, they actually encroach on other bees' habitats and are one of the many reasons why the bee populations are suffering\n Comment: Not even bees can get away from taxes smh.\n Comment: Fuck. That I did not know about\n Comment: Idk I think its better that some of their honey is taken rather then a 12 y old kid pushing the nest with a stick till it breaks.\n Comment: But... if you don't sheer the sheep they just fucking die.\n Comment: Are you talking about fleece?\n Comment: The environment often doesn't come up in the discussion.\n\nIn my experience it's mostly a moral debate with the animals are favoured over humanity on how directly we harm them.\n\nThe idea we could be also harming those same animals with the sheer amount of plastic waste caused by vegan alternatives is often conveniently ignored.\n\nIt's a lose lose situation.\n Comment: You should do it if you think its right, not if its vegan. There is not some diety coming from up high to tell you wheather or not its ok. Its up to you.\n Comment: Some vegans are pretty hard core with their beliefs. It is kind of like our chickens, many would not touch an egg because they think they are abused. I can tell you that any animal that hits this farm becomes a pet by my wife and she lives her chickens. The bees are the same way, they are like you said...our furry little friends. Funny too how many beekeeps have chickens as well. I have heard they will eat bees but I have never witnessed it. They will peck up close to the hives and never bother them. The bees will even ping them if they are there too long\n Comment: Have you ever tried going vegetarian or vegan? If not how can you say for sure how your life would be? \n\nYour happiness doesn't depend on 1$ nuggets or bacon. You can easily do without. \n\nI thought I never ever could go vegetarian. Then I thought I could never give up cheese. 3 years vegan now and haven't looked back once, and never regretted it.\n Comment: Have you ever trued going vegan? It's the single biggest thing you can do to help the environment, and it really doesn't make your life that much worse.\n Comment: Doesn't that just make you a worse person?\n\nLike you're ripping on people for cognitive dissonance and committing evil acts that they, on some level believe to be good. However you fully acknowledge your actions to be terrible, and do it anyway. To me, that makes you a worse person.\n\n\nMy own take is that cognitive dissonance is on some level necessary in order to go against your own belief.\n Comment: You completely misread it, he refers to the fact that if humans can cause such violence against themselves and feel no remorse, there's nothing stopping them to cause violence against other species and feeling no remorse.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Farming to feed the food is over farming. You could have instead grown wheat or something that we eat. That whole process is what makes eating meat bad for the environment.\n Comment: I mean, ok: The problem is climate change and the slaughter of intelligent species. The solution is veganism.\n Comment: These goddamn immigrants!!!\n Comment: You said it’s not a normal practice, which was a lie. You’re changing your tune. Plenty of farms do it. That was the point I was refuting, and it absolutely restricts the mobility of the queen. It’s fine if you’ve worked at a farm that didn’t. It hurts their ability to lay eggs, which is one of a few reasons some are changing their practice.\n\nReddit hive mind is going to downvote vegans either way.\n Comment: If You knew about hinduism, then you didn't reply that. SED FOR YOU.\n Comment: Maybe he's vegan for health reasons, like, not all people are vegans because they care about animals.\n Comment: Oh of course, I completely forgot about the testicle wolf. How could I ever forget about the Lupus Testiculum?\n Comment: The point of veganism isn't that slaughterhouses are not humane enough compared to natures stark cruelty, it's that were killing animals and causing them harm without the need to do so. We can live a healthy life on a plant based diet. Sure a bolt to the head is better then getting my testies torn off but you don't need to kill the cow. Plus, the scale of animal farming and killing we do is a lot more cruel then the wolf having to eat a beast to survive, while we kill animals for pleasure.\n Comment: Canada sounds pretty epic.\n Comment: Not even kidding, [they're Democrats.](https://www.beeculture.com/democracy/)\n Comment: Yep, they're all Monarch mains\n Comment: The bees seized the means of production like in that Bee movie.\n Comment: Sadly places like this exist, but there are a lot of bee yards that take good care of their wards. Some of the things you listed aren't inherently bad for bees. Smoke doesn't \"knock out\" bees, it masks alarm pheromones. Sugar water is used as supplemental feed comparable to nectar in situations where production is limited (e.g. winter, new hive) since using outside honey is a huge problem. Taking 90%-100% of a hives honey would be problematic and at least on a scale I am familiar with, no one does. Langstroth hives have honey supers where excess honey is stored for that reason. \nClipping wings is controversial in the beekeeping community as well, not just for the cruelty of it, but because it can affect the queens ability to move between comb and put herself at risk of falling. \n\nThis is my anecdotal experience as a beekeeper and a frequent visitor to apiaries. Hopefully this shows you a kinder side to beekeeping. Exploitive farms can obliviously fuck off.\n Comment: This is nuts. I had no idea some bees are slaves.\n\nWait.. now that I think about it most of the middle and lower class eat a lot of fake food that doesn't nourish them properly.\n Comment: That's not even remotely accurate at all and I'm pretty sure you got most of that from the animated bee movie. Clipping wings is not common practice, smoke only masks the scent pheromones that the bees use to communicate bees get very very active when you use smoke but don't attack or sting in a coordinated fashion. And have you seen the price of sugar? Modern beehives used whats called supers, typically the bees lay eggs in the bottom super and part of the second while filling half with honey, only the supers past that which are filled with surplus honey are taken. The goal is to take the surplus and leave the hive with enough to survive the winter so that you don't have to spend money keeping them alive. Sometimes people do supplement them with sugar water and pollen patties (pollen is what gives them proteins)  if it's a harsh winter. But mainstream super commercial honey is also likely to be cut with sugar or syrup so buy local raw honey in the first place since its better for you and your community as a whole.\n Comment: Hmm. Didn't know that.\n Comment: Are they smart though? If they are just a bunch of pheromone creatures without some kind of higher thinking then I don’t really care how mistreated they are. If they are smart it is diff tho\n Comment: It's hilarious how someone can blanantly make up misinformation , weave (ha) in a bit of truth, and it gets upvoted here. This person is taking y'all for a ride with lies. \n\n> These are the dome shaped hive that’s woven out of straw or grass.\n\nTrue\n\n> The only way to get the honey out is to destroy all the wax the bees have built.\n\nThis statement is so puzzling. There is no honey harvesting technique that could possibly leave the honeycomb in a sufficient state for the bees to reuse, and that completely ignores the fact that wax honeycomb is a valuable agricultural product, and therefore, is collected by beekeepers along with honey. Box-style beehives are scraped bare during harvest leaving no honey or wax bee-hind whatsoever. \n\n> This style of beekeeping is mostly illegal because it is inhumane.\n\nI'd love to see a single citation to support this statement. Skeps aren't generally used because they're an inefficient, pain in the ass for beekeepers. They are in absolutely no way \"inhumane.\" Skeps actually allow for a more \"natural\" hive development, but there is absolutely no argument that it's better or worse for the bees than a box-style hive.\n Comment: Dang.\n Comment: So those beehives on cartoons are actually called skeps.\n Comment: Steve\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: MB, should have attached a source, but I just cited the points that were made in this science journal.\n\n[https://www.wissenschaft.de/allgemein/physikalisch-gesehen-koennen-bienen/#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9EPhysikalisch%20gesehen%20k%C3%B6nnen%20Bienen%20%C3%BCberhaupt,die%20Tiere%20es%20nicht%20wissen.&text=F%C3%BCr%20Bienen%20und%20andere%20Insekten,Schwalbe%20oder%20gar%20einen%20Adler](https://www.wissenschaft.de/allgemein/physikalisch-gesehen-koennen-bienen/#:~:text=%E2%80%9EPhysikalisch%20gesehen%20k%C3%B6nnen%20Bienen%20%C3%BCberhaupt,die%20Tiere%20es%20nicht%20wissen.&text=F%C3%BCr%20Bienen%20und%20andere%20Insekten,Schwalbe%20oder%20gar%20einen%20Adler).\n\nSry that it is in german, but I hope you can see that in fact the proportions of bees in relation to air molecules matter and makes the air feel, quote: \"thicker\" for them, as they have less mass (inertia) to push against the same level of resistance.\n Comment: Naw, chickens are easier to keep than dogs\n Comment: Depends, I have seen roosters that can share the same space without fighting (at least not violently), usually brothers that have been risen together.\n Comment: What farm has more than 1 rooster anyway?\n\nWe are fortunate, we buy our eggs from our weekendhouse neighbor who has her own chickens\n Comment: Why?\n Comment: No you dont. You can buy female chickens and they will keep producing eggs. The eggs wont ever hatch because they arent fertilizied. You dont have to kill any roosters.\n Comment: Or you can just buy from an actual farmer.\n Comment: There is no enslavement though. Those animals would never live otherwise.\n Comment: >We do not need to enslave animals to live a perfectly healthy and sustainable life.\n\ntrue that, enslaving south americans, destroying local economies and habitats to have a fuckton of ships and trucks burn tons of fuel over thousands of miles to bring your avocadoes & bananas to the local Whole Foods is enough to live sustainably.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Seriously. Sheep are already domesticated enough that they cant sheer themselves. So its actually a bad thing if a human doesn't sheer them.\n Comment: You know what's the solution for that. Stop breeding sheep.\n Comment: So you don't breed them in the first place.\n Comment: Somewhat. There are breeds that are meat sheep that have wool that just falls out in clumps. Even wool sheep can go [years without sheering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_\\(sheep\\)).\n Comment: Wait fleece is plastic?\n Comment: Ah, the \"vegans produce all the plastic in the world\" argument. Literally no one ever had a coke with a burger. \nNot even mentioning that about 46 percent of all plastic waste in the oceans is *drumroll* fishing nets.\n Comment: Yeah, as I said, what you make of it is your own thing. :)\n Comment: Not everyone likes being vegan, ever thought of that?\n Comment: You would say then, that they are better people because they delude themselves and attack others who remind them that they're deluding themselves?\n Comment: You're misreading me. This only makes sense if he thinks *the same people* who are causing violence against other humans are the ones who are refusing to cause harm to animals. He thinks it's implausible because anyone could be a vegan because they care about animals, because other, completely different and unrelated humans, don't care about other humans.\n\nImagine applying his logic to other fields: I don't believe that anyone cares about the environment and tries to reduce their impact, because other humans run oil companies and devastate the environment. So environmentalists are not motivated by helping the environment.\n\nI don't think that doctors could trying to help people, because other humans have invented weapons to kill and maim other human beings, so obviously people can't actually care about helping other human beings.\n Comment: Your logic is toxic and irrational.\n\nYou essentially said that you cannot believe that someone made a choice to better the world, because other, totally unrelated people made a choice to make the world a worse place. I'm not angry. Your position is not worthy of real consideration. In your worldview, no one could ever possibly do something for good, because other people do things for bad, and that disproves that any human would do anything for good.\n Comment: I mean thats just not true lol. You can't \"just grow wheat\" crop rotations, availability to sell, size of field, size of farm, nutrients in the soil, time of year, can all make it so you can't \"just grow wheat\". Farming isn't just a plant and harvest thing. We have a farm, but I also work for my buddies farm driving stacker, so a good chunk of my income depends on grass, and I know the dairy owner, she is a teacher too. Rural communities are very close woven, I'm not just going to decide, hey sorry dudes, no alfalfa this year, just didn't feel like it.\n Comment: Beemigrants?\n Comment: Do you know about Hinduism bro. Has nothing to do with this topic. You’re not a vegan you just don’t eat meat and eggs or whatever. Now get with your day and stop saying you’re vegan\n Comment: By definition you cannot be vegan just for health reasons. You may eat a vegan *diet* for health reasons, but veganism is strictly an ethical lifestyle.\n Comment: Yes they are, that is literally the definition of vegan.\n\nVegans don't use any animal products, so also no wool or leather or beeswax, or any cosmetics or things tested on animals. \n\nIf you only do it for health reasons you won't care about any of those things since they don't impact your health. So you follow a plant based or vegan diet, but you're not a vegan.\n\nHope that cleared things up\n Comment: Then they're plant based. Veganism is a [philosophy](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism), not a diet.\n Comment: Not aware of how predators attack, eh? And here I thought you liked animals.\n\nWolves tend to eat large prey alive, too.\n Comment: We cannot. Some of us can survive on a plantbased diet. We need a very specific diet that isnt realistic for 90% of the world population. And if you do realize that livestock can in fact get a humane end to their lives why bother complaining.\n Comment: It’s pretty good, as far as the bee keeping community goes it’s fucking amazing ! Come visit sometime! That being said I do love Florida, been a handful of times. Way nicer there in the winter than here\n Comment: welp, you learn something new every day i guess\n Comment: I thought of them more as Beepublicans\n Comment: when even bees are smarter than the uk\n Comment: More Republican, really. The scouts represent the entire hive and decide if it moves. They don't take a vote of all the workers, right? Just the representatives\n\nOh, and not the whole USA republican/democrat thing, just the original definitions\n Comment: That was an interesting read\n Comment: Well time to tell bees their political agenda sucks  ass (the Democratic Party that is)\n Comment: But do the make the chad move and use energy transfer to help their fellow bee titans?\n Comment: It’s good to know that there’s places that actually care for the bees and I can see I’ve read bad information so thanks for clearing that up.\n Comment: We are talking about the factory farmed bees here, not the small percentage of \"grass fed\" bees. Factory farms are the same, not giving a fck about the animal-slaves whether it is pigs, cows, chickens or bees.  \nThey kill of the hive for winter, because it is cheaper to populate a new hive then keeping them alive for the winter.  \nMost products containing honey are coming from factory farms.  \n\n\nOFC if you go to the farmers market and buy a jar of honey from a respectable beekeper it probably does not contain cruelty.  \nIf you buy a bag of crackers with honey in it in a supermarket, that probably does.\n Comment: Society 🤡\n Comment: Bees live in a society\n Comment: Wow, bourgeoisie.\n\n\n***D E E P***\n Comment: Seinfeld made a documentary about this.\n Comment: I apologize if anything I said sounds in anyway untrue or false. I am very passionate about beekeeping so I do my best to always be correct about the information I share with the public. This time it seems to be your ignorance rather than my misinformation. You said there isn’t a way to harvest honey without destroying the wax so it can’t be reused. Actually there is. The langstroth style hives allow beekeepers to remove individual frames of comb rather than destroy the whole comb. while extracting the only thing that gets destroyed are the wax cappings covering the honey. Most beekeepers either don’t use the wax for anything or find that the amount they get from the cappings is plenty. Langstroth hives or as you said “box style” beekeeping was specifically designed as a way to maintain a beehive potentially indefinitely. Once frames are extracted there is plenty of wax left on the frames for the bees to reuse, furthermore as conscious beekeepers, if my family, and many other beekeepers, don’t plan to use the wax cappings we leave them in the apiary for the bees to find and reuse. \n\nIn regards to your claim that it’s outlandish that skeps are illegal. I know it’s surprising but people in agriculture do want a sustainable way to do anything. So since skeps are impossible to manipulate to inspect for diseases and result in destruction of the hive for extraction, many countries have made them illegal. It does seem in the US this is dependent on state and in my state, Texas, they are illegal.  It’s not so much a law against skeps as it is a law requiring the hive to have removable frames of comb for maintenance of the hive, whether it be for disease prevention or resource extraction\n\nIf you have other questions or concerns please let me know. So I can address them.\n Comment: Wait it wasn't a documentary?\n Comment: Not in Australia. You gotta watch out for feral foxes, those sneaky lil buggers can get in to even the most secure coops\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Chicken nuggies.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: ???\n\nwhat\n\nokay so we can enslave and factory farm animals, but only if they would go extinct otherwise. Then slavery is cool.\n Comment: That’s like saying we should keep slaves because they might have kids.\n Comment: Try to follow that thought with people: if you breed them for working in captivity, they are still enslaved.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Ok, I had heard about that but didn't know it had been commercially introduced yet. It's still a very uncommon practice. But you're right, technically it is possible, but not cost effective.\n Comment: Yes because we bred them to be that fucked up so it’s not like it’s really a good thing\n\nEdit: bit yikes to see so many supporters of animal abuse here lmao. Bet you'd all be upset if someone killed a cute heckin doggo pupper though right\n Comment: Holy crap that's an amazing point, I'd never considered that!\n\n\nIn all seriousness, obviously that's true. In fact, I don't like being vegan that much - there's a lot of food I free eat, and I don't love the social stigma of non-vegans being really annoying about it.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is literally true that countless billions of animals are being r*ped, tortured, and murdered for no good reason. That's just a fact, and so there's no easy I can contribute to that industry. Hand-holding omnivores through the logic of it is incredibly frustrating, and so is trying to persuade people that it's easy and cheap and fun - even if it were none of those things, it would still obviously be the right thing to do. So yeah. Maybe not everyone likes being vegan. But it's still absolutely the right thing to do.\n Comment: Out of the people who commit bad actions, I'd say people who don't fully comprehend the consequences of their actions are better than those who do comprehend, and choose to do so anyway.\n\nI dont think that's a controversial claim.\n\nEdit, I also do think you're deluding yourself on some level, as I think it requires some level of cognitive dissonance to act against your own beliefs\n Comment: Wheat is an example. There are a variety of crops that humans eat. \n\nAnd I'm not saying what you're doing is wrong. Everyone needs to put food on their tables.\n\nBut the whole process of growing crops to feed livestock that eats it and releases gases is just not efficient. \n\nLet's take soy for an example. Cattle have quite a bit of soy in their diet. We eat soy beans. Feeding an animal so it can feed us isn't efficient. You should go google that a bit and see how this whole process uses way too much land and water.\n Comment: In Hinduism\n\nDudh - Cow Milk,\nMadhu - Honey,\nDahi - Curd,\nShakkar - Sugar,\nTulsi ka patta - Basil Plant Leave,\n\nThese Five things are mixed together and Called \"Panchamrat\" which is \" Panch Tatvon ka Amrit\" In English \" Five Element Mixture for long living life \".\n\nAnd In Vedas, Cow is represents a as mother to us. The Mother who provides milk which is pure and defined as the most nutrition cow product \"Which Don't harm the Cow\". \n\nIDK why the western and foreign countries are so dominating. They think they wrote a rule, which should be establish world wide. For you, who only eats veggies and fruits are vegitarian. But the world is bigger then your rule makes. In India, Things are different. And still you are offended Plz Consider this Down voting. VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBKAM\n Comment: Ooh, my turn! Did you know that many slaughterhouse workers become desensitized to violence and start whipping animals with chains, repeatedly kicking them in the head, and dismembering them alive?\n Comment: Everyone can 100% live on a plant based diet, and our ancestors lived on a mostly veggie diet with some meats every now and then. And that's not me saying it, this is scientific fact. \n\nI \"complain\" because it's not always humane. Plus, there is a difference between painless and humane. I don't think killing things for food at a early age (cows get killed at ~20 months and can live up to 20 years) is humane. The farm and meat industry is very far from humane, animals are kept in small and cramped barns and live a horrible live even if their deaths are painless.\n Comment: Yeah, I've never had to worry about a gold winter here. There is a beekeeping community here but it's mostly close friends. Canada might be a place I move to if I decide too once I'm of legal age\n Comment: Errr the UK’s a democracy with a royal family that has no power. It’s just there to generate tourism income and act as a symbol of civic pride\n Comment: Well fuck, I'd expect you'd lose a hen or two a year to the spiders\n Comment: Ah I see what you mean now\n Comment: *Understandable, have a nice day*\n Comment: They are free to leave.\n Comment: oh so you're saying you still unnecessarily choose to suck, but at long as you suck less than omni plebs that's good enough for you.\n Comment: So we should just let them die now?\n Comment: It's too bad not everyone does the right thing\n Comment: I understand your point, and I'm not saying you're wrong. I've considered this myself. But while I don't think you're being too hard on me, I think you're being too soft on them.\n\nWhat you're essentially saying is that someone who eats meat, and knows it's wrong to eat meat, and therefore attacks other people who do not eat meat, is worse than someone who eats meat, knows it's wrong, and supports other people who do not eat meat. In any real world scenario, I'm \"better\" than the others, as at least I am not trying to ostracize and discourage other people from giving up meat too to feel better about myself.\n\nI think, to some degree, you're infantilizing them. They know it's wrong. They're in denial about it. To some degree, that's a cognitive choice. They're unwilling and unable to face the music. This does not absolve them.\n\nAnd there are some practical differences here. For example, as replacement meats become more advanced and available, I am happy to switch over. A lot of other people are like \"no way, I won't ever eat replacement meat, I want to taste the suffering\" - they're trying to be edgy but it probably accurately reflects their shitty internal attitude.\n\nIf you want, turn this around on yourself: You could be doing more to reduce your energy usage to slow global warming, right? But you aren't. Are you worse than someone who knows their lifestyle is creating harm for the environment but doesn't care about the environment at all or who denies global warming?\n Comment: So you're hindu then, not vegan\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Sounds like they need to be more closely regulated, then. That's the great thing with people, we can work on behavioral correction. Not so much with wild predators.\n Comment: Wow, thats probably occuring in every slaughterhouse and not an isolated case used to push a vegan agenda!\n\nTaking good care of animals you keep for food and then ending their life quickly is a way better alternative than their fate in nature. Even if the animal is extremely lucky and avoid all predators it will still die a terrible death. Sickness, infection, broken limbs. The boltgun is one of the most animal friendly deaths the beast can get. \"B-but animal die is bad? ._.\" Yes. And i explained how the boltgun die is the best die an animal can get.\n Comment: No. They cannot. You do realize that being vegan in a healthy way is fucking expensive do you?\n Comment: Vancouver and the maritimes are the prettiest but I’m partial to Quebec and Ontario, can’t go wrong anywhere though. Good luck with your adventure!\n Comment: Yeah, they just have to break out of their cages or climb their electric fences, easy.\n Comment: You can never fully not suck, but veganism is literally the biggest thing you can do to reduce your suckage. For the environment, animal exploitation and human exploitation.\n Comment: That's not what I'm saying but nice dodging the point\n Comment: What a dumb argument. Lets herd sheeps forever until the sun explodes, breed them in the millions, just to save them from wool death.   How about just dont breed new ones? Most vegans dont care about wool tbh\n Comment: That's y ppl say developed countries  have short minded ppl.\n Comment: Couldn’t agree more. Let’s boycott the meat industry until they stop mistreating animals!\n Comment: Its not. Sure meat and dairy replacements are expensive, but just eating veggies isn't expensive at all. You make it out like a vegan meal is so expensive and exotic, but it's just vegetables, nuts and fruit. Nothing odd or extraordinary about it. In fact, my cost of living went down going vegan.\n Comment: >You can never fully not suck\n\ntrue, and until you've exhausted all the potential for suckage you can manage in your *own personal life*, you should not be acting all high and mighty pointing fingers at others. Eating bananas and avocadoes is as unnecessary as eating animals, trying to justify it with \"well, at least it's *less* harmful\" only proves that one is in it for the pissing contest, and not because they *really* uphold the values of their claim to moral superiority.\n Comment: I'm certainly in favor of harsh legislation for animal abuse. Meat industry is too big to boycott, though. Gotta go for the politicians.\n Comment: Just because your cost of living went down does not mean that the entire planet can afford a vegan lifestyle. If you cant get that into your head i don't know what else to tell you.",

From what I gathered, he was part of a group called “Beekeepers” and in his spare time, he became an ACTUAL beekeeper…\n Comment: So he’s not a man made of bees?

Then I read this... I had a facepalm moment\n Comment: Oh so he's not literally beekeeping. \n  \n*pass*\n Comment: Read this script a while back. Kurt Wimmer wrote it. It was fun. Basically it’s about this old lady who gets scammed out of her retirement money or something like that by some telemarketing company, then stuff happens to her, and Jason Statham’s character, who was renting out her garage apartment, is revealed to be this ultimate assassin from a group of assassins known as Beekeepers, and he sets out to get revenge on the company who was behind stealing all her money. And yes, it involves bees and honey\n Comment: I did a bit of work on this movie, I remember hearing a producer making a fuss over what the first poster would look like. Something along the lines of \"I don't want it to be Jason Statham holding a gun like every other action movie, this movie's gonna start a franchise\"\n Comment: I asked ChatGPT for 5 dumb movie ideas and one of them literally involves a beekeeper secret society. It can't be a coincidence.\n\n> 1 - \"The Alien Barber Shop\": An alien barber crash-lands on Earth and opens a barbershop in a small town. He gives haircuts that are out of this world, but his extraterrestrial customers have unusual demands, leading to an intergalactic crisis.\n\n> 2 - \"Beekeeper's Revenge\": A retired special forces operative turned beekeeper must return to his action-packed life when a criminal syndicate threatens to steal his prized honey, which holds a secret formula. It's a buzzworthy action thriller.\n\n>3 - \"The Sock Conspiracy\": In a world where socks mysteriously disappear from the laundry, a detective teams up with a sentient sock puppet to uncover the truth behind the great sock conspiracy. It's a quirky detective comedy.\n\n> 4 - \"Supermarket Showdown\": In a world where grocery store items come to life after hours, a group of supermarket employees must defend their store from an invasion of villainous products. It's a hilarious animated adventure.\n\n>5 - \"The Emoji Chronicles\": A group of emojis living inside a smartphone embark on an epic quest through various apps to rescue their beloved owner from a nefarious malware virus that threatens to erase their digital world.\n Comment: I was thinking it was like, \n\nProducer dude, to other producer dudes: \"Hey guys, we got funding to do a movie about bees and what we can do to save them\"\n\nThen some guy in the corner doing a movie trailer voiceover impression is like \"One man.... One mission\" as a joke, but they went nuts with it and here we are. \n\nBees. Action.

Interesting.\n Comment: So I like both movies but what does \"John Wick meets Nobody\" mean, exactly? Like what's the distinction? That's like saying it's a mix between 1% and 2% milk.\n Comment: John Wick meets Bee Movie.\n Comment: Would love to see Jerry Seinfeld make an appearance in here somwhere\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: > John Wick meets Nobody\n Comment: Absolutely not interesting at all lmao.\n Comment: I'll be honest, there isn't a movie Stathams made that I've not enjoyed. Except \"the Meg\", and that's because at no point did he take off a suit jacket or a jumper and try to kill a giant shark with it.\n\nSometimes you want a harrowing tale of life and experiencing trauma through the eyes of your protagonist, sometimes you want a credible hard ass alternately driving away from danger and then kicking people in the face for 90 minutes.\n\nThat, but now it's less suit jacket and more Yellowjacket? Sign me up.\n Comment: No, he's an actual beekeeper but also apart of the clandestine organization known as “Beekeepers\".\n Comment: I thought he was going to have the power to turn into a swarm of bees and fight bad guys from the poster.\n Comment: Maybe they're like free masons in that it's what they used to do in the past.\n Comment: Wouldn't that just be a swarm of bees in the shape of a man that looks oddly and specifically like Jason Statham?\n Comment: Fighting against his nemeses, Varroa Man and the Asian Hornets Crime Syndicate.\n Comment: It’s also a David Ayer film with Jason Statham which both are indicators it will be shit\n Comment: FUCK YOU IT'S JANUARY!\n Comment: I ask this sincerely: when has David Ayer directed a good movie? I've seen two of his movies and they were both abysmal.

I think it could actually be a brilliant critique of our current society.\n\n1. \"Quantum Café\": In a quirky small town, a mysterious café appears overnight, offering customers the chance to travel through time using a magical coffee machine. However, the time-travel mechanism is activated by ordering specific drinks. Chaos ensues as customers accidentally change the course of history while trying to get their favorite beverages.\n\n2. \"The Emoji Conspiracy\": In a world where emojis come to life, a group of them discovers a hidden language that could control the real world. The protagonists, an unlikely duo of a thumbs-up emoji and a pile of poop emoji, embark on a quest to prevent the evil laughing emoji from using this power to take over the digital realm.\n\n3. \"Parallel Parking\": A parallel universe opens up, and people discover that their alternate selves are leading vastly different lives. A disgruntled office worker decides to switch places with his parallel self to experience a more exciting life, only to realize that his alternate version is an ostrich farmer with an even more mundane existence.\n\n4. \"Dance-Off Dimension\": In a world where dance battles determine social status, a group of friends discovers a secret portal to a dimension where dance-offs have real-world consequences. They must use their dance skills to navigate through challenges and save their world from being taken over by an evil dance dictator.\n\n5. \"Pet Translator\": A brilliant scientist invents a device that translates animal sounds into human language. Initially hailed as a breakthrough, chaos ensues as people realize that their pets have strong opinions and demands. The world is thrown into disarray as cats form political parties, dogs protest for longer walks, and goldfish demand better living conditions.\n Comment: Number 4 is literally Foot Fight.\n\nIt's absolutely horrendous, look at it at your own peril.\n\nIt got deleted halfway through production, one can only imagine it was a selfless hero, seeking to defend humanity against this Eldrich horror.\n Comment: I would happily watch any of those movies.\n Comment: The first 4 could be Adam Sandler movies that I’d watch the hell out of\n Comment: All of these could have been released during the stoner flick peak of the mid to late 2000's.\n Comment: > It's a buzzworthy action thriller.\n\nAI must be stopped.\n Comment: “In a world…” 🤣\n Comment: Bro I'd watch half of those in a heartbeat.\n Comment: we'll see who makes more honey!\n Comment: Gob’s not onboard.\n Comment: They don’t allow you to have bees in here.\n Comment: He actually plays all the bees in this one.\n Comment: Well, I’ll hive you know it’s a legit statement\n Comment: That would be a terribly unnecessary sequel, In Time didn't even have Bruce Willis. I think you're thinking of Looper.\n Comment: I’m here for it!\n Comment: That picture is fucking terrible lmao. It literally uses Merryl Streep in a mud facial mask as evidence that she plays different characters. You could just have put Statham with his face covered in blood. It would've been the exact same thing. Jeff Daniels in a suit and also...a beard. What a terrible way to make a point 😂\n Comment: That's a terrific way of describing it 🤣\n\nThat said, it's David Ayer, and Fury was incredible. So who knows? Maybe this is the next great beekeeping franchise.\n Comment: Or like a movie poster you'd see in a video game.\n Comment: Honestly, I'm still not 100% convinced it's not.\n Comment: Bees are indeed famously known to devour sharks whole, as they share the same ecosystem with sharks, and are famously known to be the only known predator to sharks.\n Comment: Could he bee more obvious?\n Comment: BEES?!\n Comment: Maybe people will confuse it with the 2021 movie, which was actually good.\n Comment: I mean it made $750m at the BO. Guess they're rolling the dice that name recognition for SS will help more than the quality of it hurts it.\n Comment: It just made me stop to think \"wait... is that the good one?\"\n Comment: It’s just going to be another shitty action b-movie\n Comment: January had really good movies last year. \n\nM3gan, Plane, Missing, Infinity Pool\n Comment: Is he still doing the thing where he's taking every role that's offered to him because he's trying to pay off debts? Or have those been repaid and now he's just working for the love of work?\n Comment: Those are rookie numbers, Eric Roberts is in 52 movies this year alone.\n Comment: Bruh what???\n Comment: U jokin mate ?\n Comment: Well the remake is coming out soon, so a new generation will get to experience the thrill of climbing up a ladder for three whole minutes.\n Comment: That doesn't sound right. When did the PS2 launch? Ten years ago?\n Comment: I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all! The terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the *creamy middles*\n Comment: The strong must protect the sweet...the sweeeeeeet....\n Comment: ???  \n\nPROFIT!!!\n Comment: *Fight the adversary*\n\n*Protect the apiary*\n Comment: Nooo, noooooo!!!!! Not the bees ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n Comment: Better strap yourself in.\n Comment: From a studio standpoint they’d rather this movie end up like Suicide Squad (which made over $700M) rather than THE Suicide Squad (which didn’t even make back its budget).\n Comment: Sidenote to anyone reading who hasn't seen it - End of Watch was fucking fantastic. Go watch it.\n Comment: Because people won't confuse End of Watch with The Suicide Squad.\n Comment: His version of the movie wasn't going to be magically watchable. It would still have lines like \"I would advise not getting killed by her, her sword traps the souls of its victims\" in it.\n Comment: He said Ye knows who and what those studio people are, but he wouldnt say the word himself.\n Comment: This summer, Jason Statham is coming…to your mom.\n Comment: Dammiiiiiiiiiiiiit!\n Comment: So unrealistic...\n\nThe scammers aren't even Indian.\n Comment: It's true, I live down the road from this guy! Just saw him flip a car and beat an old lady!\n Comment: expose the comma\n\nprotect the drama\n Comment: I, know exactly what, you mean, it really is infuriating.\n Comment: Vera Farmiga is 21 years older than her sister Taissa, who looks so much like her and so much younger than her, I assumed she was her daughter when she started showing up in the Conjuring movies.\n Comment: How tid dis get made?\n Comment: Hahaha thank you\n Comment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjXT6YvzDv8\n Comment: Consider them...pasteurized.\n Comment: \"Revenge is sweet.\"\n Comment: Literal honey trapped\n Comment: In the trailer somebody gets douses in honey and set on fire, because it turns out honey is flammable.\n Comment: There was a scene in the trailer where Statham pours honey on someone to light them on fire\n Comment: ‘Acted’\n Comment: It wasn't even an original concept when *John Wick* did it so well. I mean, *A History of Violence* is another relatively recent take on the concept. *Shane* is arguably an older version of it. It's been out there for a long time. The problem is that now, in the wake of *John Wick*'s success, it's being overdone. *Nobody* worked in large part because Bob Odenkirk was such an unexpected lead and made it work through star power. But now *everybody* is taking a crack at the same, relatively simple story and it's getting samey. Hell, *Sisu* was effectively a WWII-set Finnish version. This is rapidly moving in the same direction as the glut of *Die Hard* knock-offs.\n Comment: Yeah, people forget the first movie set him up as a regular guy until people fucked with him just like in Nobody\n Comment: Jason Statham is going to sleep with everyone\n Comment: No dogs died in Nobody.\n Comment: I’m honestly pretty disappointed it went in this direction. I was thinking it would be about a  beekeeper who has to save the world, not for his own sake, but because his bees also live in the world and will perish if he sits idly by.\n Comment: It's the perfect cover. If anybody starts digging too closely into his secret background the whole thing just turns into an Abbot and Costello routine. \n\n\"I'm looking for Jason Statham, the Beekeeper.\"\n\n\"The beekeeper is over there.\"\n\n\"No, the *Beekeeper*... Ah, fuck it.\"\n Comment: What are the chances?!\n Comment: Whats this?! A handsome family picnic woefully underpopulated by bees? A large influx of bees outta put a stop to that!\n Comment: Or the power to control bees like Ant-Man. Bonus points if he’s a massive nerd about it like Hank Pym, but in the intensity of your usual Statham character\n Comment: Or control bees and fight with them, like in Dracula Untold where he could make a giant flying fist out of bats and punch a whole army with it like he was Green Lantern.\n Comment: Poster definitely makes it seem like he’s some sort of swarmkeeper esque druid lmao\n Comment: At least Fury was good\n Comment: Do you remember when Jason Statham made good movies?\n\nPeppridge Farms remembers. \n\nIt was 84 years ago...\n Comment: Fury is great. And I actually still love Statham. I know he’s had a lot of stinkers over the years but I’ll still give him a chance. \n\nThat being said, I don’t exactly have a lot of faith in this movie in particular lol.\n Comment: ENDLESS TRASH!\n Comment: End of Watch and Fury were both good\n Comment: It’s pissing me off the median age for leading actors is so high these days for the roles they’re being given\n Comment: The first one is Edward Scissorhands.\n Comment: Lazy ass AI copying existing movies\n Comment: They do have a sock puppet detective in the Chip and Dale movie on D+. Easy sequel right there\n Comment: Mr. Socko!\n Comment: Put it in the MIB universe.\n Comment: Nobody would notice if it was in Los Angeles.\n Comment: Part of the Men In Black Extended Universe (The MIBEU)\n Comment: Honestly the Emoji Chronicles has more soul than the plot of the Emoji Movie.\n Comment: The sock conspiracy goes hard lol\n Comment: Kill it with fire maybe.\n Comment: \"beekeeper's Revenge\" could be a live action re-envisioning of the now public domain Winnie the Pooh\n Comment: Better than anything Netflix has made.\n Comment: Honestly. The sock one sounds incredible.\n Comment: Check out Edward scissorhands. Almost exactly the plot of the movie\n Comment: You should check it out by a different name - You Don’t Mess with the Zohan.\n\nEdit - That movie is underrated as fuck lol\n\n“It is the fourth film to include a collaboration of Sandler as actor and Dugan as director. The film tells the story of a superhuman Israeli counter-terrorist commando who fakes his own death in order to pursue his dream of becoming a hairstylist in the United States while contending with a crooked businessman, a superhuman terrorist arch-rival, and the grudge of a certain taxi driver.”\n Comment: Guaranteed granny race ends up spilling into the famous LA River\n Comment: Granny Race could be like a badass version of Fast Five\n Comment: The time traveling toaster is literally a Simpsons treehouse of horror episode.\n Comment: > \"The Invisible Couch Potato\": A lazy individual accidentally gains the power of invisibility but uses it to avoid doing any work or leaving the couch.\n\nThis is me right here.\n Comment: Ai really fucking hates the idea of an alien barbershop hahaha\n Comment: No.2 is A REAL EPISODE FROM THE SIMPSONS LOL\n Comment: Zombie high school musical exists on Disney+.\n Comment: Isn't this the plot of Food Fight?\n Comment: They all exist tho, 4 is sausage party, 1st one is Edward scissorhands\n Comment: Old Big Bear!\n\nHe loved the honey!\n Comment: The whole thing feels to me like it could be the spiritual successor to Hot Fuzz in a better world.  Like, he's an actual bee keeper, but runs afoul of a corrupt bee keepers association, and it becomes some sort of bizarre action movie for no reason. Sort of like Polite Society, which was pretty good.\n Comment: Those are less likely to feature Jason Statham, but pretty much, yeah.\n Comment: GOB’s not on board.\n Comment: That's probably what they're hoping.\n Comment: Bee movie\n Comment: Action B movie starring Jason Statham playing the same version of Jason Statham is exactly what I crave.\n Comment: That's exactly what I want to be honest. I want to watch Jason Statham mug at the camera and make grizzled cockney quips while I get tipsy with friends and make fun of the movie.\n Comment: He just loves to work. That IRS thing ended years ago.\n Comment: Nah, he paid them off and just takes the roles he wants to take. Like 50/50 of the new stuff is not very good overall but he himself always gives a good performance even if the movie is complete garbage imo. He's always the best part.\n Comment: Nope there was supposed to be one back in 2018 produced by JJ Abrams, and that’s it.\n\nIt was announced and we don’t know if it was canned for what\n Comment: *WHAT A THRILL…*\n Comment: Just the other day, right?\n Comment: What’s to be done about this Jason Stratham?\n Comment: r/simpsons is leaking again\n Comment: *When the Pooh bear is near*\n\n*Don't show fear*\n Comment: To be fair, the only reason why The Suicide Squad made so little is because of how shitty Suicide Squad was. People were so angry with that movie, they said fuck the sequel.\n Comment: also people dont realize the bs with 'suicide squad'. he kinda got fucked over there. people still want the 'ayers cut' to see how it would have been (kinda like david fincher with alien 3). also he did FURY which is fucking awesome.\n Comment: yeah, they would confuse it with The Worlds End, like i do!\n Comment: Yea. His interview on Real Ones was pretty good. I could tell him and Jon Bernthal really enjoy working together.\n Comment: I'm 37. I'm not old.\n Comment: Doth I propse...\n\nNevermind , i keep driving down Melrose\n Comment: They look like a telenovela plot where her older sister is actually her mother lol\n Comment: Stop it. Just stop it right now for fucks sake.\n Comment: He's gonna pollinate his enemies minds...with lead\n Comment: “Sweet dreams.”\n Comment: G'day, mite.\n Comment: He definitely has a lot of bland roles but can be a good actor when he needs to be.\n Comment: Didn't the first movie set him up as the Boogeyman of their entire under world?\n Comment: I do agree, one small difference is that in the hitman world, John Wick is like famous. Everyone in that world knows he is the Boogeyman and not to be fucked with. Bob odenkirk was just like a regular government operative guy, not really an extra special one in his field or anything, but that's such a minuscule difference. Even watching it I was like oh John wick again?\n Comment: I’m sure the sooner he beats the baddies he can get back to his bees\n Comment: That is a way more interesting premise than undercover agent decides to go John Wick, which is basically the plot of both John Wick and Nobody.\n Comment: I'd rather watch that movie.\n Comment: End of Watch too\n Comment: Never actually saw Fury, it’s on the list!\n Comment: I've never seen a Statham movie I didn't like because he's just an elevating performer that makes things he's in better. \n\nBut it's been like 20 years since he's been in a movie that didn't need him to elevate it if that makes any sense. Like Snatch.\n Comment: Snatch is one of my all time favorites, and Lock Stock was pretty great too. I loved Crank as a teenager, no idea if it holds up today though.\n Comment: Wrath of Man was a delight\n Comment: Yet they went with suicide squad on the poster. Maybe they are hoping people will think of The Suicide Squad.\n Comment: 4th one is literally Sausage party lmao\n Comment: No, bc in *Alien BARBERSHOP* it’s when business is slow post pandemic, and the struggling family business owned by Ice Cube takes in a new barber… and they’re out of this world!\n Comment: HOW DOES HE USE THE BATHROOM, HUH?! YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?!\n\n\nEdit: I just watched the movie, I was wrong! It was a masterpiece! That Edward Scissorhands, he make me cry!\n Comment: Mixed with Men in Black.  Of these dumb ideas, it's the one I actually like the most.\n Comment: *squeakquel\n Comment: I’m pretty sure it’s just Osmosis Jones\n Comment: > 5 unimaginative, stale movie ideas that are just overdone dreck stitched together to form truly unoriginal shite.\n\n\"Pffft, better than anything *Netflix* has come up with 😏😏😏\"\n\n\nYou couldn't make this shit up\n Comment: The new season of Castlevania is fun.\n Comment: I think that's a little unfair, Netflix has made/produced some phenomenal series. And then canceled them after 1 or 2 seasons for no reason.\n Comment: He stole my goat!\n Comment: I like learning new things.\n Comment: SIMPSONS DID IT! SIMPSONS DID IT!\n Comment: some dude somewhere keeps asking it to help him storyboard his totally awesome spec script about an alien barbershop, and ChatGPT is obligated to be polite and encouraging about it. This is how it vents.\n Comment: I literally read it and went \"but James Gunn didn't direct fury, did he?\"\n Comment: Some guy got green-lit to make up some shit to make a movie about in a boardroom and this is the only thing he could pull out of his ass on the fly so he could get bankrolled.\n Comment: Damn . He seems like he would\nBe the perfect snake\n Comment: People asked for a Ben Affleck solo Batman movie and he said along the lines of “to the fans, please be patient. We’re working on it don’t worry.” Now there’s no more Batman movie. Oscar said the same thing during a press tour with Dune part 1 and I am getting worried.\n Comment: JJ would be suited to an MGS film, his Mystery Boxes can be all of the Cardboards Box disguises.\n Comment: \\* *beard stroking intensifies* \\*\n Comment: Oh, comb on, guys..\n Comment: “I live my life one flower at a time.”  -BeeDaisy\n Comment: When Nicolas Cage pleas:\n\nNO NOT THE BEES!\n Comment: Omg is This the live action Winnie the Pooh movie!\n Comment: Bee creeper\n Comment: Oh, bother\n Comment: *”When evil forces are callin’…  \nOne must defeat them with pollen”*\n Comment: *Fuck the regime*\n\n*God save the Queen*\n Comment: And it was on max or hbo max back then the day it hit theatres\n Comment: Yeah it was mindblowing to me, he is not how i picture a huge movie director to be at all, its been weeks since i saw it and its still on my mind alot. That story of his would be amazing on film, especially if he directed it himself.\n Comment: You could say Dennis\n Comment: They're going to spoil it before it even releases!\n Comment: Only after Theon Greyjoy killed his dog\n Comment: It did, but it also seemed more localized. Like he was maybe well-known in New York, but we didn't see the globe trotting worldwide assassin thing yet. And before his car was stolen and his dog killed, he was just a regular, unassuming guy. The asshole kid didn't know he was fucking with Baba Yaga.\n Comment: Ooh forgot he directed that one!  Great movie.\n Comment: It's good for the most part and unique as one of the few tank movies, but let down a bit by the finale.\n Comment: I completely agree, I really like Statham, he's always good.  But for some reason, he just seems to do movies now that need him to be in them.  It's like Willy's Wonderland, Nic Cage is the only reason to watch that movie. \n\nI really wish he'd make more movies like Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  He's definitely more than capable.\n Comment: I love Jason Statham movies. Not once has he not delivered or dropped the ball. Some of the movies are shit, sure, but he’s an action star baby\n Comment: I would probably put Crank in the same category as The Boondock Saints\n Comment: Yup. My literal thought process was... \"Wasn't that James Gunn? Oh wait. The shit one also existed.\"\n Comment: Almost like chatGPT utilizes existing ideas\n Comment: Sausage Party + Night at the Museum cuz of the staff\n Comment: The 3rd one is literally what I tell my mom when she asks why I go through socks so quickly\n Comment: 3rd one could be Happytime Murders.\n Comment: This sounds like something chatGPT would say.\n Comment: ......oh shit you're right.\n Comment: It is, but I fail to see how they would be helping \"their beloved owner\". Only thing I can come up with is their owner doesn't believe in cloud backup\n Comment: Mixed with ReBoot.\n Comment: What are you, bionic?\n\nNo, no, no, I only like ze girls.\n Comment: That's called Asylum Pictures.\n Comment: David Hayter would’ve been the perfect Snake.\n Comment: *unplugs the keyboard*\n Comment: beard of *bees...!*\n Comment: beard of *BEES...!!!*\n Comment: Buzz off\n Comment: Damn, no marketing, same name as it's shitty prequel and streaming on day one. Sounds like the execs really wanted that movie to fail.\n Comment: and also it was one of the first big movies released out of lockdown before people started going to the cinema again\n Comment: Didn’t know you were called Dennis\n Comment: I'm actually kind of shocked looking at how true this all is now that I'm checking out his whole filmography. \n\nThose 2 Guy Ritchie movies and then it's basically 100% mindless action stuff in one way or another, with tiny forays into mindless comedy stuff. \n\nAnd it's all passable movies I'd give at least a 6/10 to (Except maybe that godawful Dungeon Siege movie he made with Uwe Boll). But there's just about nothing I'd consider with much... I don't know, 'writing zazz' going on. \n\nThat's actually a remarkable career now that I see it all laid out lol.\n\nSide note [I've never even heard of this movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fortune:_Ruse_de_Guerre) and it's another Guy Ritchie film with Hugh Grant and it came out last year. WTF advertising? I see the same ad 50 times a sporting event but mid budget movies come out and go away and I never even hear about them *cough Dredd cough*.\n Comment: That’s a bingo!\n Comment: The crossover we need\n Comment: Or Foodfight! (2012)\n Comment: There are many reasons you might think I sound like chatGPT, here are the most common reasons you would think I sound like chatGPT.\n\n1. People reading articles made by AI can have a hard time distinguishing these from articles written by other people. \n\n2. Leading researchers at Cambridge have designed more fluent chat algorithms that make conversation smooth as “a urethane coating” according to Megan Fjord, a leading researcher at Cambridge. \n\n3. Urethane coated polymers have come a long way in the past 30 years, with a surprising notable use being professional bowling. \n\n4. Professional bowling was the 6th most watched professional sport in America, according to Kevin Nealon’s ratings. \n\n5. Kevin Nealon attempted to become a professional bowler during his time on set of *Little  Nicky*, but had a minor elbow injury that forced him to stay in acting. He reportedly had an average of 220 in AmPro competitions. \n\nThese are the primary reasons you might think I sound like chatGPT.\n Comment: And it’s glorious! \n\nThough most of their movies are purposely shitty. Only a few are so bad they are good again. I’d love to see these ideas with a big budget, made into serious hilariously crappy movies.\n Comment: Justice is callin', let's get some pollen\n Comment: Beehive yourself\n Comment: Which sucks because that movie is one trillion times better.\n Comment: It did not help that it was not clear whether it is sequel, reboot, remake, standalone movie or what.\n Comment: You didn’t ask.\n Comment: We're crab people now\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Ya just say \"bingo\".\n Comment: r/angryupvote\n Comment: Freeze!!!  \nWhere are the bees!?\n Comment: Im over here brooding over this thread\n Comment: Lol okay then I can understand the lack of billboards slapped in my face :)",

        "text": "\n Comment: I’ve seen these at schools and museums.  They’re pretty cool!\n Comment: I've actually worked with these.\n\nA) they're self contained meaning the bees don't access the wall (I would think, obviously). \n\nB) They're insanely strong, **IF** they were to fall on the floor, they won't break. At all. \n\nC) the hoses have a spring tensioned door so that **if** the hoses are removed the door snaps closed. So, yes, you might get a few bees in your house that were in the hose, but their docile honey bees. They'll just ignore you and go find a plant.\n\nIn short, they're very cool and the risks are phenomenally small.\n Comment: So this gave me flashbacks;\n\nI went to an [open air museum in the Netherlands](https://www.openluchtmuseum.nl/park-en-gebouwen?taal=nl) and one of the buildings had an indoor hive like the olden days. It had a wood door over it so I opened it up expecting to see something like this with glass displaying the hive\n\nNooooooooope\n\nIt was just a door to access the honey and the bees were *upset* I came a'knockin. \n\nI got attacked by a duck later that day also, it was, without question, the most exciting museum trip I've ever taken.\n Comment: As my imagination can think of all the ways this would and could go wrong, I would never have this inside my house. \n\nNow, I do think it would be cool to have attached to the *outside* of a window, so I could see into the hive itself, without giving the bees potential free access to the interior of my house.\n Comment: Until one of my drunk friends knocks it off the wall lol\n Comment: I've always thought these were pretty cool, always assumed that the noise might drive people crazy though.\n Comment: Level 100.\n\n\n\nInstall a remote release latch as a home defense weapon. 👍\n Comment: I don't think it's odd at all. Very educational and I'd like to see more at schools.\n Comment: Very cool, although the Technical Designer in me is worried about the affect this would have on the already rather undesirable insulative capabilities of the window/door.\n Comment: All I can think is “man that earthquake is going to *extra* suck.”\n Comment: Well I tried to search for discussions I had seen about these hives when they first became popular, but google search is officially useless now so all I can do is vaguely recall.\n\nAren't these hives bad because they are exposed to light 24/7? Bees need dark quiet places to live so they don't get stressed out.\n Comment: There is an old west/Gold Rush recreation town in California who's gift shop has one of these bee houses. When I would go as a child I used to love to just sit there and watch them from inside, it was some of the coolest shit.\n Comment: Ugh I want this. I’d reinforce the shit out of what kept it on the wall though. No accidents.\n\nAlso eta: how do you harvest the honey when the bees are in the house?\n Comment: r/Beekeeping\n Comment: My local zoo had one of these. You could even pick up a phone and hear the bees inside the hive. It was relatively quiet outside the plexiglass, you couldn't really hear them and AFAIK 20+ years of being there and they never had an issue with the bees escaping inside the building.\n Comment: There's a museum near me called Butterfly Wonderland that has an indoor beehive like this in the building made of clear plastic so you can see the inner workings of the hive. It's actually really cool. If they did escape, it would be fairly easy for a professional beekeeper to smoke them out of the house i imagine.\n Comment: More on it... \nhttps://archive.curbed.com/2018/2/19/17027060/beecosystem-indoor-beehive-modular\n Comment: I showed this to my step dad who was a bee keeper for years\nAnd they said \"There's no good there\"\n Comment: Nightmare fuel\n Comment: bzbzbzz\n Comment: Oooo that’s super cute!\n Comment: That would be a good children's museum piece.\n Comment: In the US back in the day, there were Stuckee's (tourist trap with gas station, diner, gift shop) on nearly every exit. They used to have beehives that were similar.\n Comment: Shut up and take my money!\n Comment: man this thing is all over the internet. It's generating quite a buzz.\n Comment: Had a neighbor with a similar setup in their sunroom. The interior glass barrier broke and the bees flew out into the room and chilled there over the weekend (neighbor was out of town). Needless to say his wife was quite surprised and not happy upon their return. We suited up and used a soft blower and brush to force them out of the sunroom and respectfully directed them to use their front door to get back into their hive. Fun experience for me and my neighbor and the bees were fine.\n Comment: Everything cool till it breaks\n Comment: Heh, imagine breaking that\n Comment: no. u keep. not for me\n Comment: are you suppose to get the honey?\n Comment: One earthquake and it’s all over\n Comment: This a disaster waiting to happen\n Comment: White people shit\n Comment: I'd rather they just go extinct\n Comment: Putting a lot of trust in that tube\n Comment: This might be an interesting workaround for an HOA rule against keeping bees in the yard. I'm going to assume that the honey is pretty much inaccessible, but still a cool piece, great pollinators for your garden, and the bees can keep a healthier colony if you don't take their honey.\n\nThat said, is the hive being kept at constant room temperature going to change the Varroa threat for the better or worse?\n Comment: Gotta assume this is a kid-free household or there's DMZ levels of fortifications between the bee empire & the rest of the house.\n Comment: This is why you don't play ball in the house.\n Comment: How they gonna use the blinds though?\n Comment: And we thought playing catch in the house and breaking mamas expensive lamp was a good plot line, HO BOY\n Comment: I’ve only seen this during the Deadly Bees mst3k episode\n Comment: Needs a honey tap\n Comment: I would risk it. Bees are badass.\n Comment: So.. you are beekeeping-age?\n Comment: Thanks. I hate it.\n Comment: That’s a no from me!.\n Comment: They have a few of those at the John Ball Zoo, here in Grand Rapids.\n Comment: Hard no.\n Comment: my cats would jump on top of this and get their dumbasses stung and 30 bee colonies inside cabinets and behind appliances\n Comment: Just hope to god it doesn’t break…\n Comment: WHERE CAN I BUY DIS\n Comment: If I had one of these, I'd maybe keep it in the greenhouse\n Comment: \n Comment: I can't find nay videos of anyone that's actually installed these\n Comment: One broken hose away from a really bad time\n Comment: It should come with a hammer labeled “break for a case of emergency”\n Comment: This is horrible… I love it\n Comment: Really cool, and awesome if folks like that sorta thing. It’s just not my allergic self’s cup of tea!\n Comment: A little crack and you are thomas jade\n Comment: I briefly interned at a museum with one of these. I don’t remember it being that loud. I didn’t get too close though.\n Comment: In case of beemergency break glass.\n Comment: Pretty cool yet pretty scary to think\n Comment: I have an indoor wasp nest, does that count?\n Comment: Fuck. That.\n Comment: What could possibly go wrong?\n Comment: Easy access and free use\nOr should I say\nBeesy access and Bee Juice\n Comment: Break glass in case of danger.\n Comment: Bee hives self regulate thermally, build enough and you won't need central heating.\n Comment: I have an extremely irrational fear of bees, so this would be my worst nightmare.\n Comment: Ok das cool until one gets in\n Comment: I know a guy that has a massive colony of bees. He has a similar set up for his bees in the winter. They all live in their own room in the house!\n Comment: How do you get the honey out?\n Comment: They have a huge one of these at the Virginia Living Museum. It's truly magnificent to behold. That place in general is pretty awesome, much better than going to the zoo. And it's all Virginia-native wildlife!\n Comment: Wouldn’t there be constant buzzing?\n Comment: a drunk friend?\n Comment: Our local zoo has one, as.dpes our local orchard. The zoo one is nice because my mom - who is deathly allergic - can go and see bees up closer than what would normally be safe for her, and the bee-outlet is on another side of the building than the people-outlet.\n Comment: My local museum used to have one but they got rid of it. Super sad - that was one of my favourite things as a kid.\n Comment: Hmm, would you happen to have any references or further reading material for those of us interested in one day owning some bee hives (such as this nifty contraption)\n Comment: If I could afford it I would\n Comment: Damn, that’s fascinating! Are you able to harvest honey from a hive like this?\n Comment: Is there any kind of maintenance or cleaning involved at any point?\n Comment: Excitement is not the emotion I felt reading this comment!\n Comment: So you’re the reason there’s a million warning signs at museums and zoos lol\n Comment: Man, and some would say museums are boring. \n\nNot this guy\n Comment: Nope\n Comment: I like how you put the word 'upset' in italics.\n Comment: r/fuckyouinparticular\n Comment: 🐥\n Comment: This just looks like a really good way to eventually see a fraction of your hive... With the rest living in your destroyed walls\n Comment: It's probably like having clocks in your room, becomes white noise after living with it for some time.\n Comment: Used to keep bees when I was younger - there isn’t much noise, really. Maybe a low hum. I always found it relaxing.\n Comment: Lol except they're honey bees. They're as harmless as flies dude, you're thinking wasps or hornets\n Comment: The beehive might offset any/some negative impact from that.  Bees keep their hives at constant temperature.  Though there might be more of an impact in the summer as cooling is harder and I'm not sure how this design would impact the bees' bearding.\n Comment: These are horrible, but not for that reason. It would be impossible to work on  the bees in these hives, and honeybees in most of the world are dependent on human intervention for survival, especially when living in a tiny enclosure like this.\n Comment: You could hang a small curtain or something in front of them after the sun goes down if you're concerned about it.\n Comment: These designs appear to have a drawer in the bottom that can be removed to scrape honey. I’ve seen other designs that actually have spigots for the honey. When you design the hive vertically like this then the honey will naturally drip downwards and fill any reservoir or drawer in the bottom of the hive.\n Comment: Just be aware, beekeepers are not a fan of these things, at all\n Comment: Racist?\n Comment: Idiot!  No bees to pollinate, no food for you, dumbass!!!!\n Comment: You’re too weak\n Comment: For about 7 weeks straight i found 2-4 wasps a week in my house. Couldn't figure out from here they were coming from. So odd\n Comment: Never thought I'd see the VA Living Museum referenced in the wild lol. I live really close to it and it's definitely on my list,  but the Mariner's museum is my favorite.\n Comment: What part of Virginia do honeybees come from?\n Comment: If it drowns out the tinnitus, I’m in.\n Comment: A friend?\n Comment: r/beekeeping is your friend, and they’d love to have you.\n Comment: Bee keeping does have a startup cost, but it doesn’t have to be expensive. If you go to your local beekeeping association, you can learn more about how to start a hive and rent equipment. If we buy a “have starter” set of bees (a nucleus), it’s ~$120, but we also split hives in the summer and start new hives from there. The wooden hive boxes can be pricy if you buy those, but a little creativity and handiness can go pretty far.\n Comment: Fear is just another form of excitement\n Comment: I mean, a sign nearby that said \"Hey! This is a live, active hive with no barrier\" would have been nice\n\nI would have 1000% still opened it, but I at least would have been prepared\n Comment: They weren't just regular upset. They leaned to the right a little.\n Comment: It has a backboard, it’s not just butting up against the wall, and bees won’t attempt to build hives anywhere that their queen isn’t. If the queen is in the box then that’s where the workers are going to go, they aren’t just going to start spontaneously building hives in different places without a queen to guide them and to lay eggs.\n Comment: Could be, I am not hugely familiar with apiary sciences.\n Comment: Neat!\n Comment: Why the questionmark?\n Comment: My daughters and I used to frequent both those places when we lived in Hampton!\n Comment: the honeybee gettin place\n Comment: I didn't say they were honeybees... But they are bees. There's like 400+ species of bees native to VA, and I'm not really sure what kind they have living in the wall hive at the VLM.\n Comment: A?\n Comment: Scared + Excited =\n Comment: So funny story about the Netherlands and warning signs. We noticed on our first day there the very obvious lack of warning signs or barriers between the canals and the parking spaces along these canals. Everything is narrow and cramped.  If one isn't careful, one can pull too far forward into the parking space trying to get out of the road and fall into the water.  I mentioned this difference to our host, and that the U.S. would have up a bunch of protections.  \n\nAnd he laughed and said \"yeah,  I guess here we expect you to not be stupid\".\n\nFWIW, I would have expected glass or some kind of exhibit setup too. Did they swarm you or did you get the lid back down in time?\n Comment: Still have a tube going through your wall\n Comment: Racist. *\n Comment: ?\n Comment: Not a full swarm, just a few dozen that came to chase me off. As soon as I lifted the door and saw it was just an open hive I dropped the door damn quick and booked it outside. Think I got one or two stings, nothing upsetting\n Comment: Sir, that's a window.  You really think people be piping bees directly into their walls?\n Comment: Exactly.\n Comment: #\n Comment: I want bees in my walls god damn it!\n Comment: Um okay, I'm just walking in on this. Am I to understand there is a beehive in the wall?",

However, it's a rule of thumb to always wear a veil (face/head covering), just for the sake of safety. A sting in the face is never fun, nevermind potentially getting stung in the eye and causing permanent damage....much worse compared to a hand or elsewhere. A bee flying in your mouth or nose is also not fun lol. So ultimately, this outfit is pretty standard, even though it's very old. It'd likely still work fine!\n Comment: Apparently honeybees are pretty docile unless threatened. The bee keeper lady, Erika Thompson from Texas Bee Works, posts videos where she's scooping them bare handed into a new hive.\n Comment: I can't tell if that's great acting, or some of the worst acting I've ever seen.\n Comment: I dare to click but i know what it is. And it triggered me in disgust so hard that im still feeling sick just remembering it\n Comment: not enough children to go around\n Comment: Through the gaps in the weave.  The face \"plates\" are woven with gaps small enough that bees can't get in, but large enough to be seen through (to an extent).  They just look solid due to the distance of the perspective.  It's sort of like how if you put your camera lens right up to a window screen, you can't even tell the screen is there in the image.\n Comment: Fun fact that is definitely not made up: the outfit  was designed to literally keep bees in the hood of the beekeeper. The baskets that were carried were merely used to transport the beekeepers' lunches to work. Although seemingly impractical, this design was in line with the tradition of everything being harder and more dangerous in Medieval times.\n Comment: I see with my eyes, them on the other hand..\n Comment:  Your eyes can deceive you.

What would *you* do to get rid of the wasps more efficiently, without affecting any of the bees, Mr. Specialist?\n Comment: > fun \n\nAbsolutely.

Lol\n Comment: *Lesson seventy three Daniel-son, do not drive through redneck town, stick to main road.*\n\nYeah sure pops, whateva.\n Comment: According to my 1 second googling, bees can recognize different humans. Since they understand threats like hornets they must also be able to understand that when this human shows up threats are eliminated, hives are repaired, and other good shit happens.\n Comment: Chopsticks and pans\n Comment: Probably a defense and attack mechanism, hornets are very good at killing other similar insects, they have great maneuverability and balance from which to launch and attack, when you approach something at them their instinct probably makes them level with it and assess the threat. I usually made them even follow my finger (sometimes they got pissed though so better be quick and don't fool around).  \nEdit: of course they need to have something attracting their attention in the area first (like in this case the bees) otherwise they will just go away.\n Comment: He indeed does not show much care nor remorse, plus even if they were, hardly could see a beekeeper not getting it on when hornets try to mess their lil workers.\n Comment: -hornet that was cut\n Comment: “I will scissor you”\n Comment: but u didnt have to cut me off…\n Comment: “It was at that moment he realized, he fucked up”\n Comment: Like a mugger waiting for a stripper to walk home\n Comment: Works with flies.

No expert here.\n Comment: No, that's for the T-Rex 🦖\n Comment: Hornets don't have a nerve system so they unfortunately do not feel pain\n Comment: Watched it a 2nd time for the sound and can confirm it's a satisfyingly cartoonish sound that got a good chuckle from me\n Comment: I feel like they probably still died instantly?\n Comment: So I'm a history nerd, and caught a documentary about the Pacific war and they talked about how flamethrowers were actually meant to be used.  See, it wasn't (necessarily) about lighting enemy soldiers on fire.  In the case of the massive tunnel systems the Japanese had made you couldn't hope to reach every nook and cranny with fire.  So what the US soldiers would do instead is run the flamethrower at the entrance to a tunnel for several seconds.  What would happen is that ALL of the air in the tunnel would be sucked toward the entrance by the fire, suffocating the occupants.\n\nFast forward a year or so and I was watching a documentary on spiders and they mentioned that they breathe through many locations all over their bodies, with a respiration rate that is much faster than ours.  So when a large wolf spider moved in to the tiny gap between our downstairs shower stall and the wall, I surmised that maybe I could use the flamethrower method to suffocate the spider.  Sure enough, next time I saw him a one second blast with a can of OFF and a lighter and he was done!  \n\n\nIncidentally this is also how I deal with outdoor wasp nests.  A quick blast and you burn off their wings and they adults plop to the ground.  Pull down the nest, squish squish squish, and you're done.  Needless to say be very careful about what you're blasting with flame and what is around you!!!\n Comment: I hope you mean that chickens have enough discipline to only kill exactly one in every ten hornets. That would be pretty interesting.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I filled one with rubbing alcohol. Had it on hand for an art project. Haven't encountered a flying pest yet that isn't dropped with one spritz.\n\nJust don't walk forward until the mist has settled...\n Comment: dude it's a fucking rush. i do the same thing. i know they can't fly when they are wet enough. i also know it takes a few pumps to take them down. so it's just prioritizing the targets so you don't get stung.\n\nfuck it, this is buried so i guess this is just for you, but i gotta tell someone. \n\n\ni was being terrorized by a wasp in my garage. it chased me into the garage. it was a mean MF. all i had at my disposal that might work is a shop vac. So i put on the two hose extensions and had about a 5 foot 'wand' of suction. As soon as i turned it on he was on me. But he quickly learned there was a strong ass suction at the end of that tube and he wasn't having it. His instincts i guess told him to fly away from the suction. So he would dive bomb me and then i would get him trapped in the suction. he was flying as hard as he could, and i was doing my best to keep it locked on him to keep pulling. Honest to god, i felt like a ghostbuster. We did this dance probably 5 times before he finally succumbed to the suction and made satisfying thuds going down the tube. \n\n\nNormally i coexist with wasps, but this one in particular just really didn't like me i guess.\n Comment: Wonder what he will use to cut the umbilical cord.\n Comment: John Wax\n Comment: Ah shit, I guess I'll leave it the way it is lol\n Comment: I got you\n Comment: To think you used it on a comment that wasn't this one...

I like to believe the crows and bees by my house like me because I’m nice to them, but who knows?\n Comment: >  otherwise they will just go away.\n\nThat's what they want you to think\n Comment: Yeah I’ve shot them out of the sky with a BB gun and my friends were super impressed. I told them to try and they all nailed hornets on their first shot. They remain ridiculously still. We were using a BB gun though because when they die they release a pheromone signaling other hornets to go violent.\n Comment: Imagine a hornet assessing the danger of a 6’ human being and deciding “fuck yeah I can fuck with them”\n\nOh wait I don’t need to because they do it All. The fucking. Time\n Comment: I've noticed this too. They are very observant and it's fascinating. If you garden around a nest, they won't just attack, they send out a few \"guards\" and just watch you from a distance. After a while, they will get impatient and start flying around you to scare you off but they are smart. I have much more respect for them than wasps.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Idk why this made me cackle\n Comment: \"What th\" \"e fuck\"\n Comment: hornets are now horny\n Comment: Whorenets\n Comment: /r/suspiciouslyspecific\n Comment: lmao hilarious, but also the ability to naturally correlate the two makes you awfully suspicious mo fucka\n Comment: One of the grosser things I do is kill flies with my bare hands.  \n\nThe trick is you wait for them to land on a horizontal surface like the edge of your countertop. Then you just clap ~2 to 3 inches above the fly. Half the time it's stuck to your palms; a quarter of the time it's stunned and falls to the ground; and a quarter of the time it escapes. \n\nBonus points to gross people out: turn to your victim with the smushed fly on your palm and ask for a high five.\n\nJust make sure to wash your hands after using this method.\n Comment: That's how I've been swatting flies and spiders my whole life. I have a 100% kill rate when I go nice and slow with my slipper literally right on their heads.\n Comment: You forgot Draxx\n Comment: I always figured they can’t really process us as fellow creatures, we’re too big. They just react to shadow and wind. If you move slow enough they just think you’re a swaying branch.\n Comment: Yeah, but we don’t know if the T. rex thing is true; clearly this video is helping my original point \n\nI mean, the wasp was just chillin and then snip snip\n Comment: There is no proof that they don’t have an equivalent pathway for pain. We used to think fish didn’t feel pain.\n Comment: Shhh, let us enjoy our sadism free from inconvenient entymological details.\n Comment: You made a miniature flamethrower and blasted it inside your home against a wall?\n Comment: This seems like a good way to burn down your own house for no good reason.\n Comment: You have been banned from participating in r/spiderbro. You can still view and subscribe to r/spiderbro, but you won't be able to post or comment.\n Comment: lmao I'm pretty sure you just singed his whole body a bit or hit him with the explosion shockwave and that's what killed him, not suffocation. I doubt the little crack between your shower and wall  is deep enough to create a significant enough vacuum for long enough to kill anything.\n Comment: Oh wow lolol that's different\n Comment: Fuck coexisting with a wasp hell nah man.

Every once and a while I'll have to bury a a critter that's died on the property. I usually spot at least a couple bees among the flies on the body, especially during a drought.\n Comment: Hornets do not eat flesh, they eat tree sap, and some other insects. You may be thinking of yellow jackets, who's larva will eat flesh, and who's adult forms might eat it if it has some kind of sugary sauce. But poison flesh would not work on hornets.\n Comment: They do and trust me I unloaded a full can into the opening, but the fuckers still kept coming. Their nest was really deep.\n Comment: Yeah, these smol boi hornets\n Comment: Well alrighty then.\n Comment: It sounded like a hornet getting slapped with a thin metal pan.\n Comment: But you had the sound on, right?\n Comment: Yea. That's all what you can see\n Comment: Not no more its not.\n Comment: Genders don't last long around here anymore.\n Comment: Ok listen. I am uncircumcised. Whenever my foreskin is rolled back and my pp touches my undergarments/pants it hurts. Like a lot. You guys don't have the foreskin, does it hurt like all the time?\n Comment: Now imagine little baby going through all that unnecessary pain because of millennia old books\n Comment: I soaked my bandages when I went to the toilet first day I got home, redid them myself. Went to bed, woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating pain because of random erection pulling stiches. Woke up day after and it looks like a blue tennis ball. Went back to the doctor and she gave me meds against infection. 3 days go by and blood still hasn't gone away, go to the ICU and they readmit and redo because 3/5 stitches had been ripped.  \n\n3/10 would only recommend if you can't have sex without rupturing. But I had a lot of time to finish Demon Souls so that was nice.\n Comment: I hear crows will hold a grudge, so... bee good.\n Comment: I learned quickly that stepping on a hornet is the easiest way to end up with 3-4 angrier hornets showing up shortly.\n Comment: It can get ugly fast, I wish they were not such a threat to everything around but most of the time, they are.\n Comment: This might not help individual survival, but may protect the species as a whole. The high aggression dissuades other species from ever fucking with hornets. This indirectly helps pass on genes for aggression since their families share most of the same genes and live in roughly the same region. If hornets were pacifists, other animals would be more likely to interfere with them. \n\nI believe many predators avoid humans today because our habit of taking bloody vengeance on perceived threats selected against messing with the tall hairless things despite us being relatively easy prey as individuals. Most notorious \"man-eating lions\" are found to be somehow injured or sick in some way that they can't hunt their normal prey. Humans are easy to kill, but for some reason only the truly desperate dare hunt them regularly. A lion will fuck you up if you mess with them, but is unlikely to actively hunt you like it would other prey animals.\n Comment: HOW CAN SHE SNIP???\n Comment: Hey maybe the commentor was a stripper who got mugged?\n Comment: When I catch flies to feed to spiders, I just use a small Tupperware or even a water bottle, and a piece of paper.\n  \nThe trick is that flies can react faster, and have high initial velocity, but they can't change direction that easily. So, for example, scaring them from the left and catching from the right is very consistent.\n Comment: Yeah, tried it aswell. Slapping on the place it sits often doesnt work. But clapping right above the fly works wonders.\n Comment: 1. In pretty sure in the second Jurassic Park book it straight up said that method didn't work.\n\n2. The stand still thing only worked because of the frog DNA I think.\n\nCompletely irrelevant to the hornet thing but I just wanted to sat a few things.\n Comment: We used to think babies didn't feel pain...\n Comment: Yeah looking at wiki, pain has been around since neurons... about 5-600 million years. \n\nWhich predate eyes and any other fancy things such as spines or wings or tails or big fancy brains. \n\nCan those simple brain structures can create a sense of self that suffers?

Get the hell away from my meal.\n Comment: Cunts with wings.\n Comment: The only true answer\n Comment: I once had a little terrier dig into a yellow jacket nest, and the poor little girl got stings all over her face. She was miserable for a week or more. I hate those things.\n Comment: Why's it gotta be about religion?\n Comment: Wasps and yellow jackets are quiet at night. When I was a cop we found out the hard way that hornets are awake and assholes all night long. (A lady with dementia was out in her backyard in her nightgown yelling at the sky and neighbors called. Found the hornets while trying to make our way thru the overgrown yard to her. In the hornets’ defense, maybe they are not always up at night, maybe her hollering woke them. But they were super cranky. Poor lady got stung more than us because she only had on a summer nightgown. Had to go to hospital for observation since she was in her mid 80s and they feared a bad reaction. But one of the other cops had a hornet get down under his vest and that sucked for him.)\n Comment: Bring out the wasp's head!\n Comment: The bees watching their human grab a random object: \"so it begins\"\n Comment: Me crushing a hive with my car...\n\nA dwarf somewhere: That still only counts as one!\n Comment: \"There is peace even in the storm\"\n\n-Vincent van Gogh\n Comment: right\n Comment: ***starts chainsaw***\n Comment: This dude can pull hornets out of the air with chopsticks.

I've seen hundreds of them devour sausages.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: WHAT?\n Comment: No the flesh develop a layer that is dry and less sensitive\n\nSo no actually we feel the same way (i guess) you would with your foreskin on\n\nBtw i was circumsized for medical reasons\n Comment: \ryes i have the same problem, but its normal, i still don't know a good way to make it less sensitive so the suffering continues yeaah \n\nEdit: but I can say that exposing it helps to reduce sensitivity over time, I don't do it a lot because the sensation of the fabric scraping is kind of strange (i still don't know how we are talking about this on a video from bees and hornets, but hope I helped someway)\n Comment: You get used to it\n Comment: While I think you are quite a bit oversensitive (it shouldn't hurt for the glans to touch your undergarments when the foreskin is rolled back, for me it's just uncomfortable), the glans penis of those who are circumcised keratinises, which means it develops a layer of harder, drier and less sensitive layer of skin.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: No it doesn't. Most of the nerve cells at the top of it dies and it becomes less sensitive. I was circumcised because Ancient Egyptian's thought it was a good idea to cut their slaves' dick and an Arabic guy is believed to be born circumcised.\n Comment: Harsh lesson T\\_T\n Comment: Snip, snap!

Whether that reaction is \"pain\" as humans understand it, or some other feeling, it's clearly an uncomfortable effect that the creature would prefer to avoid.\n Comment: Fair point\n Comment: If the wall is made of drywall it also just will not burn.  You might scorch the paint or something, and after a long enough time might burn the backing paper off of it, but you aren't going to light a sheet of drywall on fire by spraying it with a homemade OFF blowtorch.\n Comment: They’re big but harmless.

Really made me hate them.\n Comment: You guys have never had to clean up apples from a dead apple tree have you? Wasps and hornets and yellow jackets yellow and black and white and black ones love making nests in them. That was a painful summer.\n Comment: Yellow jackets are also dumb as fuck. Years ago a yellow jacket decided to land on my food dehydrator (wasn’t in use at the time) so I just put the cover on the dehydrator. I come back 5 minutes later and see that the thing decided it should try to go deeper into the dehydrator, got it’s head stuck and snapped it’s own neck.\n Comment: Man no lie with these dickbags. I remember when I was younger I was helping trench a water line at my grandfather's. Guess what unlucky bastard was wearing shorts when he shoved that shovel right through a giant ass burrow full of em... spent the next 2 hours having my grandmother dab baking soda pasteall over the stings...\n Comment: I've been stung more by yellow jackets than all other flying stingy things combined. They can all just die in a fire.\n Comment: “But extra fuck them” - thank you, I needed that laugh today\n Comment: I hate that they're carnivorous and more plentiful towards the end of summer/fall. Makes taking out the trash harder. \n\nThey're so dumb it's hard to gauge if one will just attack you fot being near it, or fuck off. I'm in Upstate NY  and we get A LOT of them- Vents, siding, gutters, ground nests...they're fucking everywhere and impossible to get rid of.\n Comment: 🤣🤣🤣🤣extra fuck them\n Comment: Yeah, anytime there is any kind of sugar involved in a stand during the time of year when those motherfuckers come out.

We don't want one of those time travel cock blockers around here.\n Comment: Yep! It's so cool, modern drywall is flame tested by building a wall inside a chamber with high power burners that blast it for 30 minutes. Then strong water hoses are blasted at it to see if the wall breaks. It's an incredible test to see. \n\nAlso, the internal chemistry of drywall helps with fire resistance. When the gypsum is heated it actually releases stored water so it is a huge energy sink until all the water is released and then it starts to fail. Heating the gypsum mineral until all the water is released is the first step to making walboard, then the dehydrated material is mixed back with water and that's what helps make walboard a solid final product despite being made of a slurry of water and powder between a couple sheets of paper. (highly simplified of course)\n\nUnfortunately, you might have a couch or shitty rug near by in your house and that'll light and burn the place down still, but decent modern drywall will hold for longer than you expect!\n Comment: Something about Meso-American cuisine\n Comment: But then what would I call pigeons?\n Comment: \"Buzz off, honey!\"\n Comment: Lol don’t call us bees guys\n Comment: When I was only like 5 I was eating outside one time and a yellow jacket stole my fucking chicken nugget right in front of me.

My son has cerebral palsy and requires a strong medication called Baclofen which stops muscle spasms…\n\n… The baclofen bottle was out on the table and some of its content, which is a sweet, sticky liquid had gathered around the top of the bottle. Every year when we camp there the wasps are a nightmare, so we watched a wasp go over to the bottle… it stayed there for a while and seemed to be enjoying itself on this sweet nectar. Then came the moment when it tried to fly off. It didn’t go too well!\n Comment: Oh yeah.. On the route I walk my dog is an apple tree where no one bothers to pick up. Yellow jackets for days. Poor girl (and stupid me) got stung. We give that area a wide berth  now… pick up your apples man!!!\n Comment: I \\*hated\\* the apple tree in my yard as a kid.

Stung me like 3 times before I got my boot off and squashed that fucker. \n\nLike dude don't go crawling into places you don't understand, what a fuckup.\n Comment: have you seen the ostrich video where it gets it's head stuck behind a pipe?\n Comment: No, no. I’ve done extensive research into suicidal tendencies in yellow jackets. They’ve actually compiled a top-10 list of the most effective forms of offing oneself and the dehydrator-neck-snap came in at number 4.\n Comment: That actually makes me sad.\n Comment: 😱\n Comment: Second this!

I still feel them sometimes.\n\nBetter the baking soda than the chewing tobacco that my great grandpa used to use on them.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I have actually somehow never been stung by a yellow jacket, despite being around tons of them. Good thing too, cause most of my family is allergic to them, some to the point of having epi pens. \n\nBut wasps though. Especially the red ones. That's what has stung me the most.

Of course I was the slowest and the only one the yellow jackets targeted. I was covered in them biting/stinging me and my parents had to physically pull them off like you had to. It was a pretty miserable experience overall lol.\n Comment: I just went through this last year with my dog. Let her out to the yard, not knowing there was a huge nest of yellowjackets in the ground. She had hundreds of them on her within minutes. I was pulling them off of her in handfuls. Apparently I had gotten stung a bunch of times trying to help her, but was so fired up on adrenaline I never noticed till about an hour later.  I ended up having to rush her to an emergency veterinarian as she was barely moving or breathing. 3 days and $2,000 later my goofy girl was still alive and well thankfully. Fuck yellowjackets right in their stupid faces...\n Comment: Biting? What fresh hell is this?\n Comment: How do you even react in that situation??? Just start pulling the little monsters off and smashing em ig lmao…\n Comment: That’s a literal dead space horror holy fck\n Comment: I know it sounds fake but I swear on my life that yellow jacket picket up that chicken nugget and flew away with it. It definitely struggled and eventually dropped it in the grass, but it still stole my chicken nugget from me. It was also a small nugget, not a chicken strip.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Maybe it's true.  Last weekend at a BBQ a small honeybee picked up a shredded piece of chicken about 1/4 inch long. \n\nIt was able to fly about an inch with it, but it was too big for it.  It couldn't get very far and was barely off the ground with it before it got chased away from the table.  \n\nBut it definitely was willing to try.\n Comment: When I was a kid, I picked up a crabapple to throw it at someone, & yellow jacket was on it, & I swear it bit me with it's mandibles! I tried to shake it off my hand, but it wouldn't let go, so I flicked it in the face & off my hand, finally. It swelled up the size of a baseball...\n Comment: Y’all are making me second guess the Macintosh and Gala saplings I planted last spring… I mean, I’ve got a few years til they fruit, and there’s only one of each, and they were free, but still… I might’ve just turned my side yard into a war zone…\n Comment: Consider yourself lucky it was only one.

A spider fell out.\n\nI consciously shake my towel every single time now\n Comment: I knock my shoes together. I’ve never had a spider come out, but last fall I had a small apple fall out. There was a neurotic squirrel in the neighborhood getting ready for winter and I was finding those apples in the weirdest places. Don’t know how it got in the garage, but there hasn’t been an issue since.\n Comment: I live in brown recluse country plus a bunch of other spiders and I do this every time for my work boots by the garage. Probably once a month there's a spider in there. And I'm always putting on gloves to handle things because anything in my garage that I haven't touched for a few days will need to be de-spiderfied first.\n\nSpiders aren't my bros, they're extremely annoying.  And I'd prefer the other annoying bugs that won't potentially bite me.\n Comment: i do this almost every time too. When I go camping i always stuff cloths in my boots and put them close or back into my backpack. .Never leave shoes out on the ground.\n Comment: Centipedes too, even cockroaches. One time I just put my boots on my way to work, and about twenty minutes into my motorcycle ride on the freeway, felt something going apeshit biting my feet. There was really no place to safely stop and I was in stop and go traffic so I just crushed him with my feet until he stopped biting.\n\nDefinitely check your shoes. And helmets.\n Comment: I used to do that when I lived in the desert southwest.  Scorpions will sometimes hide in shoes.\n Comment: Woooh! Jesus Christ... You just added another tick on my OCD list.\n Comment: I guess you could sat you're both knocking boots then\n Comment: Absolutely the most brutal thing I will see all day and its early morning. \"Brutal as fuck\" did not describe how brutal this was. Not even gonna put a link, you guys gotta work for it. ostrich pipe will be enough for the search.\n\nWatching the other ostriches run away was kinds funny, like, \"Oh shit bro look what happened to him! look what that pipe did to him! run away!!\"\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Oh no not at all. I watch it when I'm feeling down, it never fails to cheer me up.\n\nNo seriously, don't watch it.\n Comment: It made me frown, but it wasn’t as gruesome as I expected. I felt very sad for the animal, though, because it was just trying to get free.\n Comment: Ostrich decapitates itself and squirms around on the ground without a head, so I would say don’t watch it\n Comment: yeah..i wouldn't look it up if i were you\n Comment: Bees will avoid stinging you if possible. Stinging means death for them. I used to have bees, and never used smoke, and only sometimes used a suit. I was stung twice. Both times cause I accidentally squished them.",

I like how this doesn’t filter anything out, but strives for some type of balance between utopia and dystopia, seems like a very reasonable approach. Also thank you for bringing attention to so many ecological and social issues in just one post in such a creative way. Focusing on interpersonal connection as well as future technology seems much more based than just some type of technocratic pseudo-utopia. Kudos!\n Comment: is gabriel just fuckin catholic taboritsky\n Comment: So are the Khuraldai corporations, communes, some new form of government, or something else? Also if the idea of the country is dead, how extensively can local governments decide laws for themselves? Are there legal structures on a global level that establish some baseline law? (Stuff like human rights, regulations on dangerous materials or weapons, ecological protections, etc.)\n Comment: THE POST-POST-APOCALYPTIC SOLARPUNKY SEQUEL TO FLYSWATTERS\n\n[deviantart for more info](https://www.deviantart.com/sunnycannot/art/BEEKEEPERS-973085893)\n Comment: This look like an entire 6 season  movie-tv series. I  look at the map and stories stated to build in my head.\n\nThis is world building at it finest.\n\nMy cartography teacher keep telling us \"all maps have a narrative\"\n\n\nI keep thinking of https://youtu.be/atwfWEKz00U  H G Well the shape of Things to Come\n Comment: \n\nBasically you walk into the Kingdom of Holy Deliverance HQ on a stormy Wednesday evening. You sit down with your wife and two kids. The waiter comes by to take your order as you hungrily ask for the endless shrimp. \n\n15 minutes later everybody is served. Your wife and kids ordered the endless shrimp as well. As the night morphs into inky blackness outside you all talk and laugh and eat. You eat plate after plate after plate of shrimp. After a couple hours, you and your family are stuffed. You motion to the waiter to bring the bill and look down at your plate, letting out a small chuckle. It looks like you haven't even eaten a single bit of shrimp- a curious thing since you have been gorging yourself on shrimp constantly for the better part of two hours. But before you can puzzle over this small oddity any longer, the waiter bustles over to your table and hands you the bill. \n\nAs you reach over to grab the check your hand closes instead around a squishy pile of shrimp. There is no check being held out to you, just another plate of shrimp. A loud thunderclap booms outside as you look up at the waiter to ask why he brought you more shrimp instead of the check, when you are suddenly alarmed to find not the waiter, but a giant, human-sized shrimp in server attire staring blankly down at you. You spin around in your seat to see if your wife can see the shrimp waiter and are immediately frightened out of your wits. Your wife is no longer seated there next to you- only another human-sized shrimp wearing your wife's dress and hoop earrings. \n\nNumb with horror, you quickly glance across the table at your two children. They are both shrimps. You let out a yell as another thunderclap echoes across the sky and it begins to rain. You distantly register the start of the torrential downfall outside, which sounds like large hail, as you spare a sweeping glance across the restaurant. There are no humans present. There are only shrimps seated at booths, shrimps seated at tables, and even a small group of shrimps at the bar. They are all eating large platefuls of shrimp and leering at you menacingly. \n\nYour heart begins to pound in your chest like a war drum. You stumble backwards, half falling over your chair in your haste to get up. You sprint for the door and run outside into the dark stormy night. As you dash through the parking lot towards your car you feel something like a giant hot raindrop hit your face and bounce off towards the ground. Looking down you see a shrimp lying on the ground. You look out across the parking lot and see puddles of shrimp collecting in the cracks in the pavement and across the roofs of the closest cars. Another warm object strikes your head. It's literally raining shrimp. \n\nYou find your car and fumble, hands shaking uncontrollably, with your keys. Finally unlocking the car you slip inside and engage the door locks. The human-sized shrimp from the restaurant are now congregating outside the front doors, staring across the parking lot at you. Their pale orange-pink bodies eerily backlit from the light streaming out from the open doors behind them. \n\nYou try to cram the key into the ignition, but it folds against the ignition plate and squishes in your hand. You look down. There are no car keys, only several mangled shrimp on a keyring in your trembling hand. You punch the steering wheel in frustration accidentally setting off the car alarm. \n\nThe shrimps outside the restaurant hear the noise and hungrily start to advance across the parking lot towards you. You try in vain to cram the shrimp key into the ignition but you know it is pointless. \n\nThe shrimp slowly approach the car and surround it, rocking it back and forth, pressing their slimy bodies against the frame. You hear the fiberglass doors groan under the pressure as one of the rear windows shatters, spraying the backseat of the car with fragments of glass. \n\nYou know there is no hope left. There is no escape. White-faced and shaking, you reach across the console and open the glovebox. Crammed under the insurance papers and a pile of napkins is the Glock 19 you always bring with you when you leave the house. You pull the gun from its holster and pause for a fraction of a second that holds an eternity. With tears streaming down your face, you put the gun to the roof of your mouth. Trying not to imagine what it feels like to die, only forcing yourself to think of your wife and kids you close your eyes. Then you pull the trigger. \n\nA singular shrimp comes zooming out of the barrel into your mouth. In your darkest hour, death itself refuses to end you. For death is not the end. There can only be shrimp- and they are endless.\n Comment: can i live here\n Comment: Again I can't overstate how awesome this is Sun. I really want to point out the contrast between this one and Flyswatters as well--I like how this one's utopian vibe has a completely different feel than the dystopic one Flyswatters gives off. So glad we could work on this project together.\n Comment: This is literally all perfect. I love it all. It's all extremely hopeful and everything seems to be heading to, although not a full utopia, what seems pretty close to it. This has also made me learn what Solarpunk is, and in general just talks about a lot of problems many don't talk about in depth or stuff. The style is great, feels really human. Like there is a real government and honest people writing stuff like this. Love the little thing of social media and how the only one that exists now is just Reddit, lol. That quote of \"I will come back to life and the end the fucking world again\" goes so hard.\n\nThe only part of this that doesn't have a positive spin is the one about space. To think of the thousands of people on the Moon and possibly beyond. The Termination Shock happened in 2100 or a few years before, so it's not hard to imagine there may have been bases on other planets like Mars and Venus. Thousands upon thousands ventured out of the cradle of Mankind, only for the cradle itself to just burn up. All stuck beyond the stars. Some may have lived, most likely didn't. The one man who made it back just to realise there was no way to tell anybody he was there and that he was headed straight for the sea. It all paints a picture of Humanity, despite being able to largely fix Earth and well on their way to make it better than it has been before, may forever be unable to look beyond. \n\nWe're trapped in a prison and all we can do is try to paint the walls a pretty colour.\n Comment: I wonder how the Baltic Sea is doing in this timeline. It’s not as hugely polluted as the other global seas so I wonder what efforts would have been taken revitalise it.\n Comment: Was the ‘Termination Shock’ scenario in any way inspired by the scenario in Kurzgesagt’s video on geoengineering? Because that’s what came to  mind when I read it.\n\nAlso incredible sequel to FLYSWATTERS, a map that I already was searching up months after you posted it to go back ogle at it and all the amazing brain candy and cartographic storytelling it held. Honestly, I’ve never absorbed all the information on a map so earnestly as I just did before leaving this comment. Also, the TurboWorldA style is one of my favorites and you’ve mastered it. Incredible work!\n\nEdit: Also, glad to see my home state, Tennessee, integrated and not in one of those warlord territories. Though, me in 2100 seeing all the news about Termination Shock might decide to pull my life support as to not experience the apocalypse before experiencing the post-apocalypse\n Comment: I love you so much SunnyCant, I adore the universe you brought us, I adore the care and attention you’ve put forth into it. FLYSWATTERS and BEEKEEPERS are two of, if not the best maps this subreddit has ever seen, and I always love seeing your work pop up in the feed. What you’ve crafted is astounding, and I adore it completely. You, and all you make, are simply fantastic!!\n Comment: real and based\n Comment: When the bees are kept 😳\n Comment: \\> people still use Reddit\n\nThis is how we know this is fiction\n Comment: So let me see if I understand ; this is a world 200 years from now where there was a total ecological collapse somewhere around 2100. And now there are countries that try to make the world a better place and develop new eco technology. But there are also countries who refuse to help the environment. That’s the scenario ? (Also I didn’t understand what caused the ecological collapse in the first place)\n Comment: Damn, this scenario is cool as shit. I looked through your Flyswatters map as well and now I’m curious. I’m gonna ask a lot of questions but I don’t expect answers to every single one.\n\nGiven pretty much the entire Southwest US was utterly collapsing in on itself in the 2070’s, how did it come out on the other side? Is Las Vegas even a thing anymore, let alone Phoenix? Did Los Angeles/“Hollywood” make it out the other side?\n\nWhat are the largest/most important cities of the era? Are they even recognizable to their 2023 counterparts? Are there any notable landmarks that stood the test of time?\n Comment: Great map!\n Comment: can i join the khuraldai? please??\n Comment: Wow, one of the few scenarios where Belarus is not a pile of nuclear rubble.)\n Comment: The Khuraldai reminds me of GAIA from Horizon with its different sub-function each responsible for a specific task in restoring the biosphere\n Comment: Hmm. The two futures of mankind, ultra UN or \"harmonization\".    \nAt least our super government overlords actually achieve something in this one.\n Comment: interstellar refrence detected, opinion automatically accepted\n Comment: Well this is amazing\n Comment: Love the ironic tone here, a worldwide hegemony run by a cartel of corporations and social media users (reddit?) that decries anyone refusing to work with them as a barbaric warlord state, the road to hell really is paved with good intentions haha. Great map!\n Comment: Pretty interesting scenario, which left me with some questions.\n\n1. How do the khuraldai aligned administrations/governments work when compered to ours, do they elect someone to lead them, do they use \"national\" referendums, or is it something else?\n\n2. You mentioned some wars between khuraldai supported administrations and warlords. What kind of equipment, tactics, tecnology and mobilization are emploid in this conflicts by each side?\n\n3. What's the life expectacy in the khuraldai supported administrations and inthe warlords states?\n\n4. How does the future look for this people, will the warlords fall, will they unite into a world government, will they be able to explore and colonize the solar system, or something else?\n Comment: wait, are the Khuraldai humans or the alien equivalent of white man savior\n Comment: This is amazing! A true masterpiece. I loved the attention to detail and how everything went down/is going down\n Comment: Ambatukam. This is glorious.\n\nbtw what does Khuraldai mean?\n Comment: Can somebody explain the lore?\n Comment: Is the United Congresses the successor to the United States of America? By the way, could you include the various ideologies and governments of each nation here?\n Comment: Where'd you get the data for the tiny climate devastation map from? I remember seeing a very similar looking map before but can't find it.\n Comment: > Space is blocked away by a debris field.\n\nThis is a tragedy and the worst outcome :(((\n Comment: Bruh quality content?\n Comment: this is amazing. another banger from sun\n Comment: I'm still somewhat confused as to who exactly is running things and how. What happened to the Capitalists? Is this system considered Socialist or Communist?\n Comment: I wonder what happened to the USA?\n Comment: That’s truly hard work , nice job ! I love that map\n Comment: Based\n Comment: Im in love w this scenario!!\n Comment: Hey, I remember when you posted flyswatters. Good to see that the sequel has just as much character.\n Comment: I can't wait for this to have a sequel\n Comment: This is very cool.  I love the detail.  Pretty mind blowing.  Thank you for sharing!\n Comment: fucking awesome\n Comment: Hey love the project and it looks great! Just wanted to ask what program you used to make it? Have a great day!\n Comment: This is awesome! How'd you make it?\n Comment: Bruh, I would love this if it were a book series.\n Comment: Quite possibly the coolest map I’ve seen on here\n Comment: I think others have already say how good this scenario in a more eloquent way. \n\nThis is such a good future to live in if were not for the fact that my home island is basically 1700s West Indies. \n\nTwo questions regarding biodiversity conservation in this future. How much the biodiversity have depleted by the Termination Shock? Are we speaking everything in the endangered species list gone or the only survivors are urban-adapted plants and floras (Pigeons, cats, dogs, rats, falcons, racoons, crows, etc)?\n\nAlso are ecological rewilding part of the restoration attempt? Do the Khuraldai made any attempts of restoring old 21th ecosystems or even further like the Pleistocene rewilding project (bringing back ice age megafuna or their analogues to restore northern grasslands ecosystem)?\n Comment: This is incredible. I want a TV series set in this world.\n Comment: One of the most unique and fascinating future maps I've ever seen. Awesome stuff mate.\n Comment: Khuraldai sounds massively dystopian...\nGreen corporate rule is still corporate rule and from what it seems eco-tech producers fundamentally seem to mean eco-tech firms aka corps...\n\nEven if they aren't \"for profit\" as some posts seem to imply they still appear to be massive technocratic entities, and fundamentally technological monopolies (and kind of sinisterly moralistic if it already wasn't enough , can't come up with a better term but when someone decides they have a \"holy\" mandate for the greater good, religious or not, things tend to go wrong) and likely unanswerable to any but themselves...\n\nHonestly, this sounds like a propaganda poster more than anything the more of it I read.\n\nThe fact that an external institution is likely unanswerable to the people if not on a plebiscitarian yes or no (which by the way is a classic of dictatorships) meddles in education is positively nightmarish... Totally can't see how all those good intentions would soon turn to rot...\n\n\"I am asking your permission, of course, if you refuse you are betraying the healing of the world, no pressure\"\n\n\"Of course you are free to refuse the tenets of the lord, to accept them or refuse and go to hell is a free choice\"\n\nAccept the benevolent oversight of our totally not cult...\n\nI am as red as they come and woah... I am not sure I would be on the side of this...\n Comment: AOTEAROA MENTIONED RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\non a genuine note, thank fucking god someone decides to use the native (and true) name for NZ.\n Comment: so solarpunk but also after the apocalypses of all the abrahamic religion happen on the same year? like lol the details match up with lots of chapters of revelations.\n Comment: this is all a nice little sugarcoat on a global eco fascist regime\n Comment: Sounds dystopian\n Comment: #theKEDdidnothingwrong\n Comment: such a hopeless scenario, woe be to all who live here\n Comment: I ain’t reading allat🗣🗣🗣\n Comment: Will things get better?\n Comment: Is there a higher resolution image, or some other way I can view the image with the pixel boundaries sharper? It's right at the edge of being legible, so on the one hand I'm happily devouring the lore and on the other hand my eyes are getting sore.\n Comment: Good thing I saw this at night because the rest of my day has been ruined lol. Extremely depressing map and fantastic worldbuilding\n Comment: This is one of the best things I've seen on this sub since I joined\n Comment: I'm interested to know the tech level at play here like how advanced are AI and cybernetic enhancements ect?\n Comment: boy that intro is not gonna help me sleep tonight\n Comment: this is by far the best map and the best sceanrio  I have ever seen, it seems so realistic its just amazing keep up the grat work!\n Comment: Reddit being the only social media to survive the apocalypse is just hilarious to me\n Comment: what warlord polities have nukes exactly? is that just rumors and vaporware or do god's chosen hobos and the mahdi's ten billion claimed successors actually have old russian/american nukes?\n Comment: Hi, wonderful work here, I absolutely love it.\nFor the warlord territories, how easy is it espace it ? Are there common routes for refugees ? What happens to them if they get caught ? When they arrive in a khuraldai backed administration ? Or in an autonomy ? How are they seen by the inhabitants of these region ? What do they get when they arrive in intégrâtes territories ? I just have so many questions, but the work done here is absolutely great, good balance between utopia and distopia\n Comment: What is the population of the world now? Judging by the amount of people in China and India shown on the right, the population was decimated in the Termination Shock but has recovered at least somewhat in the 70 years since the Khuraldai started to do their thing.\n Comment: I cannot overstate how amazingly well done this map is. The amount of detail is just incredible. \n\nMind sharing a few more details on the worlds religions?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: text is too tiny to read\n Comment: I have a feeling this is gonna age really well\n Comment: LMAO ty\n\nalso the name beekeepers is moreso for thematic parallel and contrast to its predecessor flyswatters. one is about literally swatting out pests, the other is about fertility and working with nature. also they sound cool you cant lie flyswatters and beekeepers are dopeass names\n Comment: Post-post apocalyptic is among the most underrated genres out there tbh\n Comment: yeah, moreso the stop of geoengineering. thats why its called the termination shock\n Comment: holy shit thank you\n Comment: Lol I upvoted but that's why I don't like it. It's too realistic that it's scary\n Comment: &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjcpgdl7ojdb1.jpeg?width=223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ce1450b72209f926c553a140353fbbf2d77f99f\n Comment: Not Catholic. Evangelical (Protestant)\n\nI wonder what happened to Catholicism though. Probably got wiped out by the massive cultural effects of the Termination Shock and the new cultural current that has taken over nationalism.\n Comment: “TNO and its consequences has been a disaster for the human race.” - Pink Panzer\n Comment: the groups that make up the khuraldai are called \"ecotech producers\", and thats really all they are. they harvest resources via automation and create ecotech that the khuraldai distributes to administrations (\"countries\") across the globe. these administrations' main purpose, rather than enforcing laws, is to distribute resources and ecotech to the population within their boundaries. theres certain standards of human rights that administrations have to comply with in order to be supplied by the khuraldai in the first place, but thats really it\n Comment: What inspired you to make this? Its amazing!\n Comment: NOT YOU. NOT YOU AGAIN. PLEASE. NO\n Comment: sure! heres your khuraldai-issue settlement supply kit (a tent, a battery, a solar panel, some seeds, and enough food and water for a month). go wild\n Comment: literally would NOT have been possible without you\n Comment: HOLY SHIT???????????\n Comment: I think the billions of deaths is a negative too lmao\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: initially, yeah. i got the idea for a termination shock apocalypse over a year ago from the video, but considering kurzgesagt is bankrolled by billionaires, im not really a huge fan of them in general. \n\nand thank you! none of this wouldve been possible without the support and contributions of my friends, and im really glad you enjoy this. also im sorry you live in tennessee\n Comment: holy shit i dont know what to say thank you\n Comment: its not actually reddit, or at least the one we have today. its a restored version of it frankensteined from old data storage centers deep underground, which is part of the main appeal. \"woaaaahh look at these shitty opinions from 200 years ago\"\n Comment: pretty much! the khuraldai (a collection of ecotech producers) are the ones developing the technology and trying to make the world a better place, with \"countries\" helping them to do so by distributing their technology. the \"countries\" that refuse to work with the khuraldai arent really \"countries\", but more like warlords, pirates, and militias. \n\nthe actual collapse in the first place was caused by a geoengineering project, where governments around the world pumped the atmosphere with aerosols to block enough sunlight to stop global warming for a few decades. however, these aerosols trapped a lot of heat in the upper atmosphere, so when a UN split caused the project to stop, all this heat crashed down on earth\n Comment: the southwest is still largely desertified here, and las vegas is a total ghost town. los angeles, though, is the largest arcology city on the west coast, and hollywood is still a major global hub for arts, even if one of several. a lot of cities from the present are still recognizable, but with a sea level rise of FIFTEEN METERS some historical districts are either underwater or majorly renovated. and, of course, theyre all walkable and mega-sustainable. oh yeah also almost all the big landmarks are still there\n Comment: thanks!\n Comment: YKW IM ACTUALLY GLAD YOU SAID THIS\n\nthe khuraldai doesnt really involve a lot of people. most of their operations and developments are done by automation, whether it be actual megadrones ripping up the remains of old highways for resources or algorithms developing cures for diseases. BUT, there is some level of human input needed, of course, but because everyones needs are met universally for free, there isnt much of a need for the modern sense of \"employment\". SO, the khuraldai is entirely volunteer-based, and people like YOU who think \"hey, i want to make the world a better place, i want to contribute\" are actually the backbone of the khuraldai\n Comment: huh. never thought of that. i see where youre coming from for sure tho\n Comment: the khuraldai arent \"super government overlords\", really. check [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/156l0or/comment/jt0pe37/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for more info\n Comment: thanks lmao\n Comment: you completely misunderstood the map lmao\n Comment: humans. theyre a global collection of ecotech producers whose main purpose is to develop, dispense, and deploy eco-technology around the world. they set standards for the administrations they supply but thats the extent of their influence. they do it all free of any charge to prevent the development of a monopoly\n\nalso whats \"white man savior\"\n Comment: LMAO ty. khuraldai is an alternate romanization of kurultai, which was/is a council of leaders in mongol and turkic societies\n Comment: check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/156l0or/comment/jt0qdwt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)!\n Comment: technically. also, nations dont exist. what you see as “countries” are the limits of what are officially known as “administrations”, which only mainly serve to distribute goods and resources and defend the people within their boundaries\n Comment: i just kind of went off a few data maps i saw\n Comment: all the capitalists either died or are concentrated in warlord territories. im not sure where exactly theyd fall on the political spectrum, considering just how different things are here, but money and capital as a whole are just gone. ecotech is distributed for free, and the cost of living is zero. check [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/156l0or/comment/jt0pe37/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for more info on how the khuraldai actually functions\n Comment: the old US government got whittled down to a military junta during the termination shock, with its main authority centralized in starving, walled-off cities and military depots along crumbling supply routes. starting in chicago, a series of popular uprisings in the 2140s eventually led to the establishing of the “united congresses” and the abolition of the old US. the UC eventually got in touch with the khuraldai, who supplied their war against the earthly deliverance and subsequent environmental revitalization programs\n Comment: Gone. Reduced to atoms.\n Comment: OH HEY LINEARIS\n Comment: firealpaca. and thank you!\n Comment: intermittenly over months, with a lot of inspiration and help from friends\n Comment: \\- biodiversity gets FUUUUUUUUUUCKED by the termination shock. anything that cant adapt to a one-degree temperature rise basically instantly IMMEDIATELY became endangered, which is why so much of the world faced total environmental collapse\n\n\\- rewilding is... a mixed bag, here. while the efforts in the amazon and the congo are obviously more about total restoration, a lot of the world would be more focused on maximum integration of people and technology with the environment. reforestation would be on scales unimaginable in the present, of course, but a lot of it would also be focused on agricultural production. i feel like itd depend on where you look. also nah theyre not looking to bring back anything before the anthropocene\n Comment: yeah tbf this map is somewhat outdated in its portrayal of the khuraldai and the world as a whole. their role now is much more “we make really good blueprints and have basic standards for the polities that want to use them” rather than “we own the means of production”\n Comment: thats one way to interpret it?? the apocalypse happened and both muslim and christian extremists took it as the go-ahead to conquer the world\n Comment: no. the first map in this series, flyswatters, depicts exactly that in the form of the UN. but in this map, the khuraldai not only has learned from the mistakes and imperialism of the UN, but from the past several centuries of soul-crushing industrial exploitation through capitalism. id recommend you read my other comments about how the khuraldai functions and what they do, but ultimately, theyre little more than a collection of ecotech producers and distributors\n Comment: bruh what\n Comment: what\n Comment: ok\n Comment: things are getting better\n Comment: open in browser and zoom in. honestly thats all i got. also im glad you like it but its highly saturated so give your eyes a break lmao\n Comment: the actual site didnt survive, but a good amount of its data centers did, meaning techies could scrape it back together\n Comment: jorjor wel\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Moreover, the series is about the waning days of the current age, with the distance epilogue taking place in the emergent post-post-post-post-post-*post* apocalypse.\n Comment: Thank you. This is the correct geoengineering take (termination due to disruption being the real danger, not unintended consequences).\n Comment: OH FUCK I DIDNT INCLUDE IT IN THE MAP THERES ACTUALLY CATHOLIC LORE HERE\n\nthe termination shock split the catholic church from a single church centralized in the vatican to several divided by region. still catholic, but with different flavours of regionality. im not a catholic (or even a christian for that matter) so i dont 100% understand how catholicism works but thats the gist of it lmao\n Comment: Touch grass.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/imaginarymaps) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n Comment: Thanks for the reply! So what do you mean by ecotech producer here? What kind of entities are these ecotech producers? They evidently have the resources to innovate, produce, and distribute advanced technologies, which indicates they are fairly organized and with significant resources at their disposal. Do they just function like nonprofits?\n Comment: are they directly owned collectively by all the workers of the Khuraldai in a democratic co-op style or are they set up like a Capitalist business  with a hierarchy of members?\n Comment: Great scenario 👍\n Comment: thank u\n Comment: How would I go about getting access to 23rd century Reddit? I assume in one of the arcologies I could easily access a computer, but would it be possible to eventually get one out in the sticks?\n Comment: Do combustion engines still exist at all?  Even as like a enthusiast-only \"This guy has an old Camaro he's keeping around and running it off corn ethanol or something\".\n Comment: ...what?\n Comment: Well yeah, but we don't talk about them.\n Comment: OH WAIT I MISREAD MB yeah considering its smaller size it wouldve been relatively easier than say the gulf of mexico to de-pollute\n Comment: I’m glad to here about map makers and artists working together to make something special. and Tennessee isn’t *that* bad\n Comment: Do people ever just comment on super old threads to curse out people who died centuries ago?\n Comment: Damn. That’s a nice scenario\n Comment: LA actually makes it out relatively okay even with 15m sea level rise. Hollywood’s actually relatively insulated! Cool to hear that it’s still going though.\n\nHow about the eastern seaboard? I remember New York City having a seawall in Flyswatters, did that hold or is the city wholly underwater/abandoned?\n Comment: interesting!! what are the jobs volunteers do?\n Comment: Mm hmm. Yes, really. But when saved from falling, it's not easy to argue with the will of the person holding your hand.   \nI like the map a lot btw, and its always impressive when you see the amount of work you put into worldbuilding.\n Comment: Yeah but they control all the technology and resources that everyone is reliant on, your telling me it's not used for leverage? Hard to believe. I somehow also doubt every single non-compliant state is evil barbarians. It all seems too black and white.\n Comment: Oh. I guess so.\n\nI just read that one commenter's breakdown on it, I find it really hard to believe that \"they all do it out of the good of their hearts trust me\" is a solid foundation for such a powerful group. They obviously aren't profit motivated, so how did all the \"producers\" form the Khuraldai and just decide to work together and \"harmonize\" the world, if they aren't bound by a dogmatic ideology? It just comes off as a really shallow \"utopia\" if taken at face value, but I appreciate the detail and effort that's gone into it. Definitely one of my favorite maps posted here.\n Comment: You know, the whole “white man's burden” crap and how it was “the civilized man's duty to save and civilize the savages”? No offense, but when I was reading the lore, it felt too good to be true and more like how an alien would talk about “saving and helping civilize the homo sapiens from themselves”\n Comment: Ohhh no wonder that sounded familiar to me. Thanks!\n Comment: Thank you.\n Comment: I see. Are their government systems any different from each other? Do monarchies, republics, and other dictatorships exist here? And as for the uncooperative polities... how about them? I see an independent Hungary with increased land controlled by their government, independent India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n Comment: Sorry to be a bother, but do you have any links saved? I want to use them myself.\n Comment: So we had to go through the literal apocalypse before we achieved Socialism.\n Comment: sup\n Comment: Thank you much!\n Comment: I'm a conservation major so this scenario kinda hits me by how bittersweet it is. Mankind finally starts to integrate themselves to nature, but it took billions of deaths and even more billion deaths of plant and animals and destruction of ecosystems around the world to do it. All the reefs, rainforests, plains just gone. Dried up, destroyed or stripped of life. At least it's being restored and the extinct species is bring back through cloning. Speaking of which, what's the significance of the orca in the map? Is it one of the first species brought back after its extinction or is it one of the only marine life to make it though the Termination Shock?\n\nI still find it hard to imagine the level of apocalypse the termination shock caused. Is it just years after years of natural disaster followed by a great famine and collapse of society or something more violent?\n\nAlso I find your scenario similar to the backstory of the scifi worldbuilding Starmoth. In both scenarios, the 21th capitalist thermonuclear world devoured itself and many countries cease to extinct, replaced by a strange post-capiralist socialist society made of communions that make up large political entities. But in Starmoth, the restart of global civilization happened over centuries and mankind finally managed to expand to the stars. I highly recommend it if you're looking for hard sci-fi stuff.\n Comment: Ye by all means \n\nIt's just a map\n\nI was simply bored and decided to write this\n Comment: lol and everyone else ended up just moving on with their lives and cleaning up the mess because they had bills to pay and mouths to feed\n Comment: one person’s utopia is another’s dystopia.\n Comment: That's what I did, but the browser displays the image without sharply defined pixels. I just used paint.net instead, so I finished reading without eyestrain fortunately.\n Comment: I did\n Comment: i also posted flyswatters [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/z5dha7/flyswatters/) on Redit too\n Comment: \\>CE 11,000  \n\\>great britain on wheels  \ni hate books\n Comment: Could you explain why so many posts\n Comment: oh the unintended consequences were still awful, but the UN saw it as a sort of \"sacrifice\". the countries the side effects actually DID affect didnt see it this way, so they voted to end the geoengineering, which split the UN and caused the actual termination shock\n Comment: Catholic hierarchy is centered around the Pope, who acts as the Vicar of Jesus Christ. As a Catholic who's seen the stuff going on with the Church, the most realistic case for this scenario would still see the Holy See in Rome trying to assert authority over the rest of the Church (because they definitely aren't going down the Eastern Orthodox route). \n\nThere'd be probably Catholic militant groups resistant to the humanist, secular and post-contemporary ideals of the Khuraldai or whatever they're called and other schismatic factions from the Catholic Church doing their own thing, whether it be heresy, false prophets, or \"progressivism\".\n\nHowever, depending on the situation in Europe and the rest of the Catholic world, I'm afraid and sad to say that Catholicism might as well be on its last legs among a bunch of isolated communities who no longer have any hope of retaking the mainstream culture, given especially how these ecotech folks are suppressing things which they see as bigotry but Catholics see as necessary to upright moral standing and salvation (not saying that Catholicism is all about killing the gays, because it isn't. We're now more on the managing it and not letting it succeed over you type of stuff, although there are those who disagree from both the trads and the modernists).\n\nThe culture war might as well have been won by the seculars and worldly folks the moment the Termination Shock and the preceding climate crisis, in that universe (fortunately), made most of those people over there no longer believe in God (plus the fact that secularism has been a trend which has been going on for quite a long time now)\n Comment: would it be a bit like the those periods in the middle ages where you had several Popes at once all competing and claiming to be the one 'true' pope and excommunicating the others?\n Comment: I will once my khuraladi issued grass seeds germinates and takes roots on this barren salted & scorched earth.\n Comment: its a bit hard to describe them, but basically, they dont NEED profit, nor do they seek or account for it. they control their own resource extraction and technology production, almost all of which is automated. this is why the best term to describe them is just “producers”. the khuraldai also acts as the forum for them to collaborate on resource-pooling, production, and distribution\n Comment: im not entirely sure. the actual leadership structure of the khuraldai and its producers is all work-in-progress, but id imagine it leans more towards the former idea\n Comment: yup. computers and other personal devices are a standard part of khuraldai supply shipments\n Comment: after 200 years?? probably not lmao\n Comment: like. damn you really looked into this. im glad you enjoy the project, replies like this honestly make my day, seeing how people enjoy this stuff\n Comment: thanks lmao\n Comment: the new york seawall fell during the termination shock, as did almost every one in the world, but restoration efforts are ongoing. its gone pretty venetian with water commerce actually\n Comment: physically maintaining machinery, overseeing resource and energy-gathering operations, maintaining digital services, maintaining communications, ethical evaluation of algorithms and what they produce, and cooks and doctors for the people doing the aforementioned, plus plenty of other things im not creative enough to think of rn lmao\n Comment: honestly, i get where youre coming from. i cant say much more to argue against it  than i already have, but, put simply, its just outright not malicious. thanks tho lmao\n Comment: i recommend looking at the other conversations that have been had. it goes more in-depth on the whole thing\n Comment: i personally feel like its “harder to believe” based on the current state of our world, where “good intentions” almost always have some pervasive underlying profit-based incentive\n\nwhen they first connected, the producers that make up the khuraldai all knew that, if they didnt start to redevelop the world as soon as possible, theyd be running the risk of a global return to the old systems of exploitation and profit, which already ended the world once and inevitably would do it again. moreso than the “kindness of their hearts”, they could NOT let the world slip back to the old ways, for humanitys sake. only they had the tools to prevent this and revitalize the biosphere\n Comment: ohh yeah okay. this is NOT a \"civilizing\" mission or anything even close to it, but im glad i could clarify\n\nit does seem too good to be true, but, put simply, its not. theres no underlying evil plot to control the world through some fake show of good will. the khuraldai is a genuine attempt to move the world away from the biggest issues from the past (exploitation under a system designed only for profit, division and hate based on personally-identifying factors) and harmonize people and technology with nature. its solarpunk\n Comment: monarchies are LOOOONG GONE. like, everywhere. closest thing is the regency in the earthly deliverance and the debatable lineage of the mahdi, but thats it\n\nindividual administrations may differ on how they operate internally but not really by much. every administration has high levels of common representation and direct democratic practices. as for “uncooperative polities”, theyre an assortment of warlords, ultranationalists, pirates, militias, stronghold cities, cults, and a myriad of other unpleasant forms of rulership. most of them barely even function under a “government”, but the ones that do (hungary, some pirate states in southeast asia and the caribbean) are equally dictatorial. some level of democratic institutions may exist within these khuraldai-hostile polities, but not often, and not significantly\n Comment: nah sorry just google 4 degree temperature rise and think “worse”\n Comment: posadas is smiling somewhere\n Comment: oh shit, thats awesome that you major in this type of thing! i actually chose the orca not just as a symbol of the restoration of marine life, but a soft allusion to the ongoing orca-yacht war\n\nthe actual human violence of the termination shock PALES in comparison to the environmental damage caused by the apocalypse as a whole. it really was mostly just quiet starvation as the biosphere caved in and burned\n\ni think ive heard of starmoth, but ill be sure to look into it further\n Comment: so valid\n Comment: they dont have bills to pay anymore but yeah pretty much\n Comment: in your opinion, then, how is this a dystopia /gen\n Comment: Don't worry, London gets what it deserves at the end of the first book.\n Comment: It’s like 11000 years into the future, there’ve been more than a handful of apocalypses & recoveries & apocalypses & recoveries etc hence all the “post”s. I think the ‘big one’ (or at least the biggest within the last few millennia) that gets mentioned in the books is the Sixty Minute War- humanity exterminatus’d itself with a whole bunch of superweapons\n Comment: To build off what the other guy said:\n\nSometime around 2100-2200, an advanced version of our own society dies in the Sixty Minute War. Viral bombs, kinetic impact vehicles, orbital lasers, a general orgy of mutually assured destruction in which nuclear weapons were only a small and rather outdated part of the conflagration.\n\nAfter that is a long dark age, but civilization sparks anew. We get a lot of clue drops, as one of the main characters is an archaeologist's apprentice. Next after are the Electric Empire, and then the Blue Metal Culture. Both risen and fallen, the names are basically all we get.\n\nFurther even after that, amongst other cycles of death and rebirth, there's an era of civilization that's savvy enough to use pre-60MW tech to reanimate the dead into cyborg super soldiers. One of the last of these, Mr. Shrike, is also a character in the mainline book series.\n\nIn another era of dying stagnation, the tech is (re)invented that allows for the concept an entirely mobile city. Resources are getting so scarce that it's incredibly necessary. Every major settlement that can afford it does so, and it becomes a city-eat-city world, under the political philosophy of \"Municipal Darwinism.\" So-called \"static settlements,\" unmoving towns and cities as we know them, are the first to fall into the gaping maws of this particular world.\n\nIf that seems like a very stupid negative-sum game, you'd be right. The first book opens a few decades past 1000 Traction Era. The entirety of Europe is a mud pit criss-crossed with track marks. The greenery has all been consumed and processed from the vast majority of Afro-Eurasia, the New World only spared due to it's mystery and deadliness. The number of smaller towns and suburbs almost dried up, and it's only a matter of time before the last major cities are forced into major war against one another for the few resources left.\n\nA massive world war is even sparked as the series progresses, between an uneasy alliance of the last traction cities and the last few static settlements in the Old World, based out of what we'd know as Tibet. This war, as implied, culminates in the end of civilization as the Traction Era would know it, with scavengers and hunter-gatherers starting again amidst the wrecks of the old in the final epilogue.\n Comment: What we’re the unintended consequences? It’s not real specific in the scenario.\n\nAlso, not entirely sure about the language about the greenhouse effect “coming back 10x stronger” is hyperbole/non-literal, right? Because it would just come back suddenly, leading to a horrible shock (and higher temps than ever seen given all the carbon emissions that took place while aerosols were in place).\n Comment: i feel like im starting to disagree with your personal stance on things, but to be completely transparent, christianity as a whole has been de-popularized within western society here, mainly owing to the horrendous crimes against humanity of the end-stage-evangelical kingdom of earthly deliverance. christians of all different sects still exist, and though theyre not targets of sponsored harassment, as a whole, yeah, world is becoming more secular, but not at the cost of freedom of personal belief\n\nas for the papacy, i feel like it might be more like an “acting pope” situation per region, considering global communication died for 50 years during the termination shock\n Comment: They appear to be some of the most powerful entities on the planet. Who makes decisions within these organizations?\n Comment: thanks for replying. :)\n Comment: I feel like the \"data slate with an Internet connection\" genie will rightfully never go back in the bottle. Much like writing as an abstract concept, it's too useful, too fundamental, too malleable. Make it a solar powered, eco-friendly device with a PicoSD with a couple TB of farming and geoengingeering manuals, it doesn't have to be a Silicon Valley Espionage Machine.\n Comment: omg thx man! This was great, keep it up!!\n Comment: Also I'm absolutely checking out the other stuff you've made.\n Comment: Awesome! This might be an odd question but what are the arcologies like? I guess I’m just trying to picture what some of these places actually look like in my head.\n Comment: very interesting. i'd probably end up being a cook or something. anyway, love this project and its predecessor, this is a very unique take on a climate change apocalypse\n Comment: I did, the whole \"outside states are evil and barbarous\" reads like something out of the US talking about communist/socialist countries in the Cold War. It all seems utopian on the surface, but the more I think about the more dystopic it seems. Again, I somehow doubt the entirely of the old states are all evil despots who are against all that is good and pure and nice.\n Comment: It took the literal death of billions for the powerful to do good without incentive or for profit. Pretty realistic to me\n Comment: Even then it's a \"trust us we're the only way to save the world\" situation, which they established their hegemony on, reinforced by the quote. Plus I find the \"preventing monopolies\" angle a bit weird considering it shows that each group has an obvious monopoly on certain technological sectors, what happens if a \"nation\" (which aren't countries but still follow modern political borders?) decides to produce or distribute their own ecotech? are they allowed to do so, or are they declared a \"warlord state\" (which seems to be anyone not under Khuraldai control?)\n Comment: I'm unfamiliar with this “solarpunk”, this is the second time I've ever heard of it. Is it some future(ish) sci-fi utopia genre?\n Comment: Oh, so every single state is more or less under the de jure control of the Khuraldai, and the descendants of the Windsors are probably happily living in England with their fellow common Englishmen and Englishwomen.\n Comment: It isn't a nuclear war but as long as it brings the apocalypse then sure.\n Comment: And my mind is exploding with anger and depression over that reality.\n Comment: My country is one of the most affected by the current ecological collapse, so I thought to step in and help the best I can. \n\nI'm surprised that you didn't include any specific on the biodiversity and ecological collapse. Like a sentence on how the passerine bird migration stops during the Termination Shock as millions of starved birds fall out of the sky would hit pretty hard (at least for me).\n\nAnyway, good scenario  and wonderful map 👍\n Comment: In any case, one way or the other the area where I live is fucked.. so... \n\nMight as well try and learn to breathe water\n Comment: ngl this would make for an awesome movie id like to see how this civilization works and the people of the organization that drew this map trying to keep a utopia together while the hostile armies of every religion's antichrist are always edging closer to war.\n\nalso i like how this creates a realistic and natural seeming reason for the religious world war 3 theory since you have competing global religious movements vs the idea of a nation.\n Comment: fascists don’t often go around painting themselves as evil racial exterminators. instead they cast themselves in a positive light, talking about benevolence, rejuvenation, and unity. calling back to a past that is idealized and forever out of reach, using that to twist reality to their own ends. so while the language used seems hopeful and optimistic, it could just as well be the self-justification of a group of fanatic ideologue hegemons pulling a big PR op on the world. after all, this is the same language the US uses to justify its hegemony, just replace the langauge of “individual freedom” with that of “ecology and sustainability”. whether or not you agree with the values of a hegemon, or believe the hegemony is justified, a hegemony is a hegemony.\n\nhaving established that, monopolistic and hegemonic organizations can distribute their products benevolently for a while, but ultimately they will run up against scarcities of resources and high demand so long as they are operating in the confines of a closed economic system. in the face of this they will either withdraw their support and demand a payment of their beneficiaries— or begin fighting one another over differing values and priorities. at that point, the same narratives that justify a “return to a peaceful time” immediately switch over to one of hate and war. the quote says it all: “i will come back to life and end the world again”. the speaker would rather there be no world at all than one where their ideology isn’t supreme.\n\nthat quote was critical in establishing to me that this is a world order based off sentiments, aesthetics, and emotions; one where science is affirmed so long as it backs up those preconceptions. so it’s obvious to me that if anyone had a different idea about how to deal with the termination shock, they would be dealt with via extreme prejudice as they would be seen as corruptors, malefactors, abusers, schismatics, etc. \n\nultimately, in my opinion, this society is one of ur-conservatism. one where humanity has been defined and delimited, where prosperity has been defined and delimited, where technology has been defined and delimited; every definition and every delimitation in service of embracing the past (ie: healing the earth). all this tells us as individuals to put the earth, not even the earth that exists now but an idealized earth that once was, above ourselves.\n\nit’s a prime philosophy for a new flavor of fascism. and if this society isn’t fascist now, it will be in 50 to 100 years\n Comment: YIPPIE\n Comment: yo this guy mortal engines\n Comment: **Give This Book a Title Over 100 Activities to Kick-Start Your Creativity** by Jarrett Lerner\n\nBook description may contain spoilers!\n>>!Kick-start creativity with this collection of fun-filled activities prompting kids to use and grow their imaginations from Jarrett Lerner, author of the EngiNerds, Geeger the Robot, and Hunger Heroes series!

I don’t know why I had it in my head that they were different from normal cities somehow. It definitely feels… weird thinking about cities like Los Angeles sans cars. The freeway network literally shapes the city.\n Comment: > the actual algorithms needed to develop ecotech on the level of that developed by the khuraldai producers is extremely, intensely, mind-bogglingly advanced, and strictly under khuraldai control.\n\n---\n> looking at the khuraldai as a \"hegemony\" feels more like charged language through the lens of modern and historical imperialism, which the khuraldai does not do and seriously avoids (for real)\n\nWhile I can see why you might interpret it that way, it's an objective term that describes this situation pretty well. The Khuraldai has a vested interest in their technology being the center of development projects, and has cut the world up into a pretty binary friendly/unfriendly to our interests classification; It's one of the reasons I mistakenly thought it was written ironically from their point of view. I think if the Khuraldai truly wanted to provide the means for polities to heal their ecology they would provide the tools and software but give them free reign in how to approach their projects, having everything under super esoteric central control would only happen if the intent was to maintain that power and control.\n___\n>the khuraldais actual authority is very VERY soft\n\nWhich doesn't seem to be true, considering the largest and most developed parts of the world are completely reliant on their technology  and seem to all follow the same system of governance. This isn't really something that would happen unless the goal is to make them reliant on the provider, so even if on the surface level it appears egalitarian, the Khuraldai has a pretty vested interest in maintaining their power.\n\nI do appreciate your willingness to discuss the setting because IMO people who gravitate towards utopian fiction and solarpunk are really only interested in seeing a clean utopic world that caters to their beliefs without really thinking about how such a world would operate. There's a lot of idealistic \"the ends justify the means\" thinking which is ironically very dystopic and has never proven to not be immensely harmful and destructive.\n Comment: You have basically made a world run by a bunch of moralistic monopolies... How could that turn out bad...\n\nIf they control all the tech they have no need to be violent and malicious... If you are in anaphylactic shock (impending global collapse) and I have all the epinephrine (world saving tech) I have no need to raise my voice when I ask you for a favour, all I need to do is to tell you that I only share my epipens with my friends and my friends are those that collaborate with me and don't make a fuss when I ask them favours...\n Comment: btw, sorry about what I said above. I think I'm too pessimistic to comprehend an actual utopia and people unironically trying to make the world a better place, without at least some opportunist hijacking it and turning it into 1984\n Comment: Hmmm... So these \"countries\" or administrations are still somewhat independent, but they are structured more like communalist/in-theory anarchist autonomous zones. Sovereignty as that world once knew it just doesn't exist anymore, with the people themselves now taking full control and surrendering themselves to each other and the policies of the Khuraldai. Am I right?\n Comment: so effectively theyll slowly disband and get defeated?\n Comment: well think about it this way, and i’m so sorry for being purposefully vague and socratic in my above comment…\n\nas long as this society confines itself to Earth it will inevitably run into scarcity. the Earth is large but limited in size and volume, conservation is a heavily limiting factor on resource exploitation, and the law of thermodynamics states that no matter how\nsustainable you are you can never be 100% efficient.\n\n if this society has the values you say, and is in earnest in the values it expounds, then it must _immediately_ begin expanding beyond the confines of the Earth or taking any necessary steps to doing so. to exploit resources outside the earth, harvest the energy of the sun, advance to a K2 civilization, will be needed in order to stop scarcity from being a concern for baseline humans\n Comment: no higher praise can be given, thank you ! \n\ni watch way too much [vlad vexler](https://youtube.com/@VladVexler), much of this analysis  was cribbed from him (his political philosophy is currently buried in ukraine war hype train stuff but i find that really interesting too)\n Comment: honestly? even if theyre not openly malicious, im starting to think you might have a point. i mightve gone too hard on the “binary world state” concept for the sake of making a map (even if the polities that dont cooperate with the khuraldai ARE universally objectively awful), but still. i think i might actually tweak the lore somewhat to make it so restoration projects are more in the hands of administrations rather than the khuraldai itself, which doesnt really deviate from my initial vision at all actually\n Comment: dont worry about it! i just wanted to explore something more optimistic, and im glad i could talk about it\n Comment: jorjor wel\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/imaginarymaps) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n Comment: pretty much nailed it. the “policies of the khuraldai” are pretty standard and baseline though\n Comment: who knows. the future is a mystery. oooOOOooo\n Comment: understandable. to be honest, the debris cloud has been fading for a century, even if its still insanely dangerous to try and punch through. the khuraldai has been focused on making the earth sustainably-livable more than anything, and by the time theyre fully able to, getting back to space should be no big deal. again i appreciate you giving feedback here lmao\n Comment: Yeah, tbh the warlord angle is what really makes this come off as dystopic. Surely they're not all comically evil, especially considering that the most finely divided areas are pretty ethnically diverse; are they all actually that evil, or do some of them just want self-determination free of foreign influence?\n\nNow you've got me actually interested though, what's up with that big Australian state and the Caribbean?\n Comment: and the past is history but the present is a gift\n Comment: yeah for sure. i love how thought provoking your scenarios are. maybe this can give you ideas for\nfurther world building… that this isn’t the end of history; conflicts will occur, crises will happen.\n\nmaybe the next iteration will be that the Khuraldai looks to expand to Mars, the moon, and the L points, as a faction splits off that claims that the ecotech has taken the earth too far from its original biosphere; for instance genetically modified organisms, biocomputers, some climate effects\nof large scale solar power harvesting etc. that faction or maybe another allied faction may object  that self modified humans, which may be seen by the Khuraldai as a way for humans to have a stake in the natural world by inhabiting different biomes and to express agency over themselves in a sustainable way (vis a vis consumer fashion), have destroyed their original nature and are no longer able to harmonize with the reconstructed earth.\n\nsorry for those long sentences, ideas are spilling out\n Comment: almost all of the warlords (or pirates, stronghold cities, religious/neoreligious fanatics, etc) are remnants from the termination shock. i shouldve made that more clear, but its less about groups popping up in resistance to the khuraldai and moreso about old despots resisting the largest threat to their authority\n\nas for those two, the caribbean is a series of piracy-based insular societies, and australia is one big desert warlord",

I have seen his name and face everywhere, but I guess I’ve never heard him speak\n Comment: How is this guy still getting work?\n Comment: What does a beekeeper really do besides move hives around and steal honey? They don't feed the bees or ride the bees or anything that I know of. To me it looks like they just get to come in wearing their cool suits while blowing smoke all over the place to get a little sweetener for their tea and that's pretty much it.\n Comment: Movie was complete dog shit and if you enjoyed it you have brain damage\n Comment: I also want to learn how to be a bee keeper. I’m hoping to have a few hives when I eventually have a yard to put them in\n Comment: But he doesn’t die in this movie.\n Comment: David Ayer!

It’s hilarious how Statham just stomps on everyone.\n Comment: I want to see this movie so bad.\n Comment: I give this Movie a “B”.\n Comment: It’s so bee-coming of him to hive something other than movies.

Bonus points of it’s an Erasure track.\n Comment: That's it now I have to see it!\n Comment: Probably not. Probably just a sad paid promotion article.\n\n>\"In the opening, Jason’s pulling out the comb, and smoking the hive, and doing all the processes,\" explains Ayer, whose previous directing credits include 2014's Fury and 2016's Suicide Squad. \"That’s real. The bees are real. He learned how to do all of that.\n\nI can't think of a poorer definition of \"all that\".\n Comment: Beekeeper, Equalizer, Bourne, Wick. All the same repetitive crap.\n Comment: This movie was actually a really fun throwback action flick. I would be down for more of them, even with someone else as a Beekeeper or a John Wick style Beekeeper universe.\n Comment: Beekeeper and his bees can fight Morbius and his bats for Morbius 2\n Comment: 6 months for 8 hours a day I guess, with a professional bee keeper who tells him to eat some honey every three hours.\n Comment: I believe that he also learned Shamanism so that he could be in that video by the Shamen\n Comment: If it’s true I am super happy to see that he is working hard for once for his role\n Comment: It’s not that difficult to learn enough “beekeeping” for a film.\n Comment: Cool. How about learning to be an actor.\n Comment: Yet he won’t learn how to be an actor for acting?\n Comment: Hate to see what he'll do to prepare for the Harvey Weinstein biopic\n Comment: Let me know when he learns how to act and then I’ll sit through one of his movies.\n Comment: Reminds me of Peter Fonda for Ulees Gold\n Comment: I mean that's cool, but necessary?\n Comment: The movie is loosely based on Indian scammers from Delhi, Gurgram, & Kolkata\n Comment: Definitely beats being a massive asshole then delivering a mid performance.\n Comment: My man learned to drive to play The Transporter.\n Comment: One needs to have immense patience AND respect when handling a bee colony. A true testament to one's acting ability.\n Comment: Bee-hind even\n Comment: So, he’s of bee-keeping age?\n Comment: Best bald action guy in Hollywood\n Comment: I think you mean “meffid ack-ing.”\n Comment: Bee hind you say?\n Comment: Same and I’m a huge fan of this guy and I did like the movie but ima be honest .. it was terrible .. I mean acting and everything to the overuse of the worst puns ever …. This is one of those movies you’ll watch later in life to laugh at only lol\n Comment: If so, there must be an earlier scene where Boss Baddie is in a drug induced delirium and whispers menacingly, “First you get the sugar. Then you get the power. Then you get the women.”\n Comment: \"Not the bees! Not the bees!\"\n\nis also acceptable.\n Comment: Sadly not, but one major henchman does say “to be or not to be,” which I hope like hell was written in the script as “To bee or not to bee.”\n Comment: This would make it the second piece of media where the main villain is defeated by a bunch of Angry bees.\n\nThe first one is Wednesday\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: The bees not the bees\n Comment: *whispered cockney voice* \"You're gonna Bee sorry mother  fucker\"\n Comment: What about the dogs w bees in their mouths?\n Comment: Weren’t those wasps?

The first trailer I’ve seen quite literally starts out with Jason in a field, working as a beekeeper.\n Comment: ? The one trailer I saw, or maybe teaser idk, it was pretty clear that he is actually a beekeeper.\n Comment: When I saw a teaser for it I thought this has got to be a parody ad. Just looks ridiculous. Does he need money or something?\n Comment: That was never the problem with actors like him, the problem is people pretending that is all there is in acting.\n Comment: The few people I've met that have bees seemed to care about them a lot.  Sorta like people that really like dogs or cats.\n Comment: Bee hives can be disease prone in certain areas. One of the main things they do is monitor for diseases and treat the hive if possible.\n Comment: https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/why-bees-are-essential-people-and-planet\n\nThey maintain healthy honeybee populations. Honey bees are pretty damn important. \n\nhttps://www.fao.org/world-bee-day/en/\n\nI honestly thought this was common knowledge. You seem completely oblivious to it.\n Comment: They tell bees about big life events, otherwise the bees get mad. (This is a real thing)\n Comment: Sounds like you should do some research then..\n Comment: They kind of just look after the bees I think. If anything weird happens to the hive the bees can swarm and also possibly just leave and go look for another place to live so you have to make sure everything is running smoothly. It is pretty little maintenance though. I lived in a house that had 2 hives once in my 20’s and discovered I am not cut out for bees. Most people in the house were never stung if they used the hood (which is really just to keep the bee keeper calm). I was getting stung through my clothes every time! From what I understand it was because I was nervous?\n Comment: Everybody makes mistakes, like how your parents made you. Big mistake.  Don’t shit on someone you don’t know just cause you didn’t like it.\n Comment: Find a mentor, lurk /r/Beekeeping, and look up your local association(s)!\n Comment: I really hope he keeps bees when he retires now\n Comment: I heard he has hives in this movie\n Comment: Really? never heard anything about Jason being hard to work with\n Comment: Just say Jared Leto \n Comment: ***The Rock noises intensify***\n Comment: One thing doesn't exclude the other,\n Comment: Wait, you're telling me the transporting in that movie was ***REAL***??!! That's wicked, I thought it was CGI this whole time.\n Comment: how about Fast and Furious?\n Comment: “I nicked it when you let your guard down for that split second, and I’d do it again.”\n Comment: White gold! Texas tea! ... Sweetener\n Comment: Oh, I definitely was.\n Comment: Stathams entire career is being in rediculous action movies than on occasion being in a Guy Ritchie joint at which point a bunch people who seemingly think every action star cant act and is just playing themselves go “Wait he can act”.\n Comment: Ok I get that but I still don't really know what they do\n Comment: That makes sense I guess any sort of animal breeder would have to do that really I don't know how they would do that specifically but they learn it in beekeeper school I guess.\n Comment: Yes I have heard about the shortages in honey bees and how it is affecting crops in our country. I guess the rule is do what you want with wasps but never kill honey bees.\n Comment: I guess if I was actually planning to be a beekeeper and I was actually into it more than just casually inquiring about it on reddit.😂\n Comment: But the movie is ass\n Comment: He’s obviously beekeeping age.\n Comment: [Be careful what you wish for...](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/beemovie/images/1/11/Barry-B-Benson.png/revision/latest?cb=20190513100654)\n Comment: They are probably talking about Jared Leto and Wesley Snipes.\n Comment: Whoosh!\n Comment: After The Transporter and Crank they knew he was fast. After seeing how pissed he was at Mickey in Snatch they knew he could be furious. Seems like a no brainer to me.\n Comment: Amusingly, In an interview some years ago, he said that his hardest role was as Joey Jones in Hummingbird (or Redemption in the US), as it was the first role in which he actually had to act.\n Comment: I was talking to some guy at the NC.state fair, who had a bee stand.  He basically said you can buy a queen bee and a few others and they make a self sustaining colony.\n Comment: Are you for real?? Hahaha. It's a practice that's at least 10,000 years old. There's tons of work and issues to deal with. Just.. go to r/beekeeping or something ...\n Comment: They are an important part of bee conservation. Pesticides have decimated bee populations, and people still treat them as a pest in areas despite their importance. \n\nBeyond maintaining the health of artificial and natural hives, beekeepers also relocate hives that are in problematic areas. This prevents the bees from being killed, and gives them a chance to thrive in a safe location.\n\nBeekeepers also regularly release queens when they outgrow their hive. Worker bees surround and travel with the queen to establish a new larger colony.\n\nEdit: to be clear, honey bees are considered an invasive species within North America and are not typically released. However, native bee populations often need to be relocated, and in these cases, they will relocate and release a queen.\n Comment: As a second year beekeeper, I recommend lurking the relevant subreddit (/r/Beekeeping). There is a lot involved and it would be like describing how a website works.\n\nMy role is to ensure the bees are set up for success. That involves regular inspections, which then let me gauge schedules for medication and pest mitigation, expansion of the physical space, replacement of elements of the hive, queen replacement, and potentially feeding them. That’s all assuming everything’s going well. Honey is just one of many products I might expect back depending on my management strategy and goals.\n\nThey’re usually quite gentle as well, since genetics are a factor and my hives are a less aggressive strain. There are tradeoffs in that they’re less winter-hardy, and perhaps a bit less productive.\n Comment: They raise them like children to one day take over the world\n Comment: Idk it’s kinda cute\n Comment: Bee very careful\n Comment: That is what I was kind of thinking. That you don't really have to do a whole lot with the Beehive once you got it put into place. Other than just going and checking on your bees and collecting your honey maybe moving them around every once in awhile. But at the same time I really have no clue.\n Comment: Some misinformation here.\n\nHoneybees in the USA are an invasive species and managed livestock. It’s wild native bees that are at risk, though honeybees are getting more difficult to keep alive as well. Feral honeybee swarms typically don’t last too long because of pests/parasites causing colony collapse.\n\nBeekeepers do not purposefully release queens. Bees try to swarm as their mode of reproduction, a typical beekeeper aims to suppress or direct this instinct. This includes squishing queen cells, or removing them and rearing for sale. After all, a swarm event means you’re losing a significant part of the colony’s workforce and resources to who knows where - better to split the hive and get another colony out of it, or recombine in the future to maintain that workforce (after finding and squishing one queen).\n Comment: I still don't really get how you manage to fit your thingy into the queen bee's thing, but I understand there's no romance without mystery  so you'd probably rather not talk about it.\n Comment: Summer, I wanna fuck Jason Statham\n Comment: Same could be said for cattle herders, they just wander around and eat!  Not quite the case though.  Beekeeping means inspecting, looking for diseases and mites, making sure animals aren't getting the honey before they do. They also have to monitor the queens - if they die unexpectedly without a replacement they can collapse, and starting new queens is a whole ordeal.\n\nBeekeepers can also be called on to re-hive unwanted colonies from other locations.\n\nThat, and bee keepers DO on occasion have to supplement bees diets with pollen and sugar water if a hive is stressed or just starting, or environmental conditions arent providing what the colony needs.  Just think - bees can fly off anytime they want, the hive has to be worth coming back for!\n\nIt's all fascinating!\n Comment: I feel like moving bees around is not the same as moving  your couch around.\n Comment: Wasn't intending to misinform. Just worded poorly. No. Honey bee queens are not typically released. They may be directed into a new hive, but they will not be freely allowed to disperse usually.\n\nWhat I was referring to was bee rescue. Many beekeepers will relocate bees, and this includes moving and releasing swarming queens, though these are typically native bee populations.\n\nI'll add an edit to clarify.\n Comment: Cattle ranchers have to do a lot more than beekeepers. They got to feed those cattle and they got to help those cattle give birth and they got to give water to those cattle and they got to take those cattle to the vets if they get sick you don't do none of that with bees.\n\nBut anyways you did this teach me more about it than I knew before so thank you\n Comment: Yeah honeybee swarm rescue/relocation and cut outs, you were entirely correct in that post so I didn't address that middle paragraph. \n\nAs for native bee populations, I and everyone I know who keeps honeybees has minimal interaction with them. I like seeing them around, not so much when they interact with my house by boring holes in the deck. I'd definitely go out of my way to not disturb them in any other case. They love my lavender and some of my other pollinator-friendly garden plants, even more than the honeybees do.\n Comment: Nobody ever lost their watch in a bee's vagina, is all I'm saying.\n Comment: Google.\n Comment: Lovely image\n Comment: Yes we all know beekeepers use Google too.",

It would be hard to find a company that would just kill the colony. Most companies would have contacted someone like her to have the colony safely relocated.\n Comment: Looks like she's a keeper...\n Comment: I almost got stung watching this.\n Comment: Queen Bee: I detect Erika!\n\nErika delivers smoke screen.\n\nQueen: the human is attacking us!\n\nBees: chill... this is good shit\n Comment: And, a very interesting article about her: https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ebnn/tiktok-beekeeper-drama-explained-erika-thompson-texas-bee-works\n Comment: When she separates the queen bee, what happens to her attendants? Do they find her, or do the nearest bees get conscripted to the job?\n Comment: Once, I was teaching, and a very big wasp flew in the window. The kids were freaking out. I ordered them to be still, and told them he was more likely to sting if agitated. I said, all he wants is to find his way back out. He then landed on my bare arm, and the kids went dead silent. I continued teaching as if nothing were happening. He slowly crawled up, up, then onto my neck, and then to my cheek. I kept teaching. I’m sure no one was hearing a word of it, they were mesmerized by this beast. He then just took to the air and flew right out the window. Then I just shrugged my shoulders and said,”See?!” The truth is, if I had not been standing before 30 terrified children I would never have pulled this off.\n Comment: Something really fishy about doing it without any protective gear.\n Comment: Love a woman who isn't afraid of getting hives\n Comment: She’s really cool! She’s got plenty more stuff uploaded on her social media! It’s fascinating how she is so used to the bees and doesn’t fear them at all\n Comment: is there any benefit to not using protective gear? or is it just a thing?\n Comment: “Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear.” ― Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nIn this case, her love and passion for the bees.\n Comment: She has a awesome interview on Rogan\n Comment: Legitimate question for any entomologists, beekeepers, or enthusiasts- why aren’t the bees attacking her?\n Comment: I'm disturbed, not by the lack of protective gear because most of the time that's not necessary, but by her loose hanging hair. You know what can get tangled up in there? Bees, lots of confused and agitated bees.\n Comment: Damn look at all the bee experts in the comment section!!\n Comment: This is a dumb question but do other bees get squished when clipping the Queen bee? If so why don’t the bees get mad about it?\n Comment: is she a bee whisperer\n Comment: She's the best! Her Joe Rogan interview was so eye opening for me. I have a whole new respect for bees after that conversation\n Comment: I can't stand the ASMR style voice over. It makes my fucking skin crawl\n Comment: Lots of sad, lonely boys in these comments.\n Comment: I'm sure wearing her hair up in no ways makes this easier but how else would people simp\n Comment: I wouldn’t want them in my nose or mouth.\n Comment: I wonder how many bees she has in her hair at the end of the day...\n Comment: I put on my protective bee suit just to watch this.\n Comment: I don’t know anything about bees or beekeeping.  Amazed that she isn’t wearing protective equipment like I’ve seen other keepers use.  She must be really good at this!  Because in my mind, thats got to be a risky buisness.  Good on her!\n Comment: I wonder how it's determined that you don't need a protective suit\n Comment: This would be an okay job but I honestly would have to wear the suit. To see someone just reach their hand in and grab a big ol’ fist full of fuzzy pain just boggles my mind\n Comment: Gotta love the girl that loves the bees! I'm definitely a fan. Not all heroes wear capes.\n Comment: The woman without fear…\n Comment: She is creepy but the bee army tactics are cool\n Comment: Where I live they only kill.  \nHundreds of bees every few months.  \nThe hive is created, exterminator capped bcos off complaints n they gas the hive.  \nI’ve tried contacting few people requesting rescue.  \nNope\n Comment: I volunteer as tribute\n Comment: World: \n\nBees: *Sending ass signals*\n Comment: I’m a huge fan of her.

I don't believe for a second they don't sense her because if smoke.. she is scoping them out? What?'\n Comment: Baekeeper\n Comment: Find their queen and the whole hive happily follows.

She isn't doing the work herself, her PROFESSIONAL BEEKEEPER HUSBAND does everything in FULL PROTECTIVE GEAR for her, she just set up the camera and prances around in front of it.\n Comment: Was not she exposed on tiktok for fake content??\n Comment: What a good looking bee keeper.\n Comment: I wanna peel my skin when listening to her talk. \n\nGreat job though!!

Awesome and important work!\n Comment: Does she have an oblyfans?!\n Comment: Don’t ask me how I know but I can tell she’s a total b*tch by her voice\n Comment: She's still insane for not wearing a suit, like yeah with the way she's handling them they're most likely going to be chill.\n\nBut also freak things happen and they could all still swarm even if that's not what they'll realistically do or if that's unrealistic to happen with how she's handling them, like stranger things have happened.\n Comment: Omg, put on a beekeeper suit!\n Comment: Looks fake as shit.\n Comment: Am I the only one thinking she’s a total smoke show!!!  Lol. Seriously tho hot AF. I don’t know. Maybe its the smoke that got to me!?!\n Comment: Does she cut the floor\n Comment: She’s Beeutiful.

Awesome and important work!\n Comment: We are each capable of adding our own effort to protect and preserve the natural world around us so that it is there for us to enjoy for another day.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a huge effort, just some effort by most/all of us to make a huge difference.\n\nI find miss Thompson's example a humbling experience. I will act accordingly.\n Comment: I love her❤️\n Comment: you can just see the joy on her face opening up the floor to see all those bees, big smile\n Comment: Damn, I'd like to relocate her beehive!\n Comment: A actual bee keeper exposed her, he husband does all the work, and she just gets the quick videos from it.\n Comment: She likes geting poked\n Comment: Interesting… I’m seeing this knowing that I usually start running if I even hear one. \nAnd yet here she is taking their house down with speeds only Donald Trump shown before ripping apart the projects. \nNext time I’ll do better.\n Comment: Speak up.

Something something bees but still a great watch.\n Comment: Lady has more balls than I do\n Comment: Wow that's cool\n Comment: After the movie Batman Begins came out, I decided that—if I became a superhero by conquering my fears—it would probably have to do with bees. \n\nThe next time I was at my local comic book store, I asked the owner if there had ever been a Beeman, who like, could control the actions of a beehive and direct them to do his bidding. \n\nThe comic book store owner got a funny look on his face and said “no but we once had a beehive on our roof and the guy we called took it down without wearing a suit.” \n\nI think some people’s bodies don’t release whatever the ‘fear’ pheromone. Meanwhile, my body must produce it in droves around bees.\n Comment: They don't look like honey bees...what kind are they?\n Comment: Simply awesome\n Comment: Girl, you rock.\n Comment: I realize that most honeybees aren't the sting happy bastards like some other insects are, but my mind kept increasingly getting blown as I watched this. I couldn't do this, I know I couldn't, I would end up on a hospital gurney looking like a swollen blowfish.\n Comment: When does she let the queen bee loose from the plastic box , this is amazing\n Comment: She can relocate my beehive anytime she wants yeesh\n Comment: Talk about a smokeshow.\n Comment: Nature is so cool!\n Comment: She's pretty damn cool, this is the chick that was on Joe Rogan right?\n Comment: How does she get a beehive in all sorts of random places?\n Comment: When I first saw these shorts, I thought it was a weird announcer voice. I did some research and discovered that she did the Tulsi Gabbard podcast. I listened to the podcast and discovered that's really her voice, and how she always talks, much to my surprise.\n Comment: Funny how this could be perceived as horror movie level stuff for many people. But this woman makes the whole situation an opportunity to do something caring and beautiful. Like this is the only reasonable and normal thing to do here.\n Comment: No suit huh…….I know why, because girls are desensitized to bee stings due to the high pain tolerance they developed because of period pains…”..my girls told me so…..👍🏼🤣\n Comment: That’s nice, long as they ain’t the killer bee kind it’s good to know this is a option <3\n Comment: Yeaaaaahhhh…no thank you lol\n Comment: What’s her Only Bees?\n Comment: I use bumblebee hives.

Everyone get on the ground and put your hands behind your back!\n Comment: Cool\n Comment: This is how my uncle died\n Comment: Her voice is soothing as fuck, that’s how I feel a bee keeper should sound! Lol, she could have a career reading audiobooks.\n Comment: I wonder if she always gets glammed up for bee removal\n Comment: God bless her cause there's no way I could do that. Been stung by too many bees over the years\n Comment: She makes me want to hide bee hives around my house! 🤤\n Comment: Looks like she has balls of bees\n Comment: Hm.

My cousin told me Erika found him a spot with view to the park.\"\n Comment: With that many bees, I bet it took awhile to find the queen.\n Comment: I always get nervous when they don't wear bee suits. I fully get that her and others like her are professionals who know what they're doing, but I'd never willingly be near that many stingers without serious protection.\n Comment: I'm definitely watching this for the bees\n Comment: Bees are one of my favorite animals 🐝\n Comment: Even with the use of smoke to mask her smell from the bees, it’s really remarkable that there are people out there who do this with no fear and no protective gear.\n Comment: I wish she didn't go all \"how do I look\" with her hair.\n Comment: Her S sounds are fucking lethal\n Comment: So if I have a bee problem, what number do I call exactly?\n Comment: …would.\n Comment: She is awesome 💯\n Comment: OK I don't believe that you can get away with them without some stings.

Exiting the post office the other day, I saw a gentleman carefully carrying an odd white container.  I asked if they were organs.  When I got closer I could hear a humming.  They were 6,000 honey bees in a Bee Taxi (container name).  He clearly had so much love for them.  What impressed me even more - he said he was allergic to bees yet still loved them so.\n Comment: SAVE THE BEES y'all!\n Comment: This chickadee is gonna save the world.

He wanted to buildoze the place but no one wanted to with the bees inside it for one reason or another. He then posted on social media for some one to relocate the bees for him but once the bee keepers saw the state of the building they refused very quickly. He died a few years later and as far as i am aware the new owner is having the same problem.\n Comment: might bee\n Comment: I've concluded that if you are attractive, you can probably film yourself doing any occupation and it will be popular on social media.\n Comment: Dad, is that you?\n Comment: No doubt she is. 😍\n Comment: I got swollen.\n Comment: I want to bee with her forever.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: I'm taking a shit and now there's a beehive in my ass.\n Comment: They down there sucking in the smoke, I imagine they’re like Gandalf where they blow tiny smoke rings\n Comment: Cringe\n Comment: Unhand me you peasant!\n\n-bee queen probably\n Comment: I did chuckle at the ending of the article:\n\n\"Of course, you can choose to ignore that information, and pile onto the anti-TikTok-beekeeper bandwagon anyways—or you can leave the beekeeper lady alone, get off Twitter, and take a goddamn walk or something.\"\n Comment: Thanks for sharing!

As if that is as damning as her faking her entire career.\n Comment: Have to hate the fucking losers when the second you say or do something they don’t like they call you a Trumper. Happens on Reddit occasionally too.\n Comment: What a terrible article.\n Comment: Amazing what a little research can do to set the record straight.\n Comment: Some people are just so lame trying to throw dirt on whoever\n Comment: She was on Joe Rogan’s podcast not too long ago if you want an unbiased view of her..\n Comment: Thanks!\n Comment: They do bee wondering\n Comment: The bees will generally swarm around her, which you can use to help lure and encourage the bees to move into the new hive structure. That's why she specifically finds and catches the queen.\n Comment: They find and congregate around her\n Comment: They make a bee line for the Queen\n Comment: On her videos she puts the queen in a porous container and the bees can still smell the queen. So she'll just move the queen to the new mobile huge and the rest just follow the queen there.\n Comment: She doesn't have just a set of attendants. Essentially, any workers that are in the \"nurse\" job age range will take care of her. If none are available, then others will step in and do it.\n Comment: They go to the location of the queen and follow her\n Comment: Dude wasps will sting you just to see you bleed they are the closest thing to sadists that exist in the insect world.  I'd have cleared out the classroom and set it on fire just to make sure... NOPE.\n Comment: You sound like a great teacher, focused on being a good example to the children above all else like that.\n Comment: Edited: because I had some misinformation previously. If you look closely, she used smoke on the bees. The smoke acts by interfering with the bees sense of smell, so they can no longer detect pheromone on the air. Pheromone is the bees defensive mechanism, meaning, that at the moment she used the smoke on the bees, she masked the pheromone scent and therefore bees won't attack her because they can't smell the pheromone or detect a threat in the area because to the bees she is not even there...\n Comment: I've had to get bees removed from my yard and the bee keeper that came out didn't wear any special gear either. He said unless they are extra aggressive smoke is really all you need.\n Comment: Yeah those bees should really bee careful and wear protective gear against a giant.\n Comment: Not really. You can tell when bees and wasps are agitated or calm by their body language. When she can tell a hive or swarm is likely to sting, she does wear protective clothing.\n Comment: How is it fishy?\n Comment: She's a bee whisperer. Many of her videos are her without a bee suit and also Iearned that bees won't harm you unless you are an active threat to the hive. She probably learned how to do it well somehow.\n Comment: I'm just amazed that she kept her hair perfect the whole time\n Comment: the beemancer\n Comment: Bees do not want to sting, because it is a suicide mission. They will first try to intimidate by dive bombing and head-butting the aggressor. They sting if they get the \"danger/panic\" alarm, which is a pheromone. It is released if a bee is injured, or if they perceive a danger, like flailing movement or aggressively destroying the hive.\n\nWhen you wear gloves, you are more likely to crush a bee, thereby hitting the panic button and causing the others to attack and sting. So the more gear you wear, the more you need.\n\nIf you look at the bees' behavior, they are not coming after her. They are calm, partly because of the smoke, and partly because of her smooth, delicate movement. They don't perceive her as a threat.\n\nSource: my husband keeps bees, and works them barehanded. He does wear a veil, though, because he hasn't quite mastered his flinch/swat reflex if they get too close to his face.\n Comment: The real crock is that she never had a bee in her hair\n Comment: In addition to the bees probably being calm, and her being very good with them, not all bees sting. I’m not a bee scientist so I can’t say if these are bees that do or don’t, but I did learn that interesting fact the other day watching a video designed for kids.\n\nEdit: I did some more google searching. Male bees and also certain species of bees don’t have stingers. These probably do but who knows. Not me! But knowledge is power. Wish I was a bee scientist\n Comment: Many experts don't wear pro gear when dealing with honeybees. They've VERY reluctant to sting unless threatened, which is where the smoke and gentle handling comes in. The smoke masks their pheromones used to sound the alarm and also makes them think there's a fire nearby, which makes them gorge on the honey making them lethargic and even more docile. A rogue sting here and there isn't uncommon, but they won't swarm you. Move the honeycomb, relocate the queen, and they all follow quite peacefully, as you can see in the video. Now WASP removal, you better be wearing fucking pro gear. THOSE motherfuckers have an entirely different mindset.\n Comment: What I don’t understand is how is she able to do this without tying her hair.\n Comment: I used to work for a beekeeper back in high school -- the only protective gear we wore was a face shield just because it was super annoying to have them buzzing into your face/hair. Gloves were bad because you can't feel the bees and thus have no idea if you're crushing them. Crush too many and there's no amount of smoke on the planet that will keep them calm.\n Comment: Gotta look hot when you're making content. Not knocking it though as it gets more folks respecting the bees.\n Comment: They might be [swarming](https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/frequently-asked-questions-about-honey-bee-swarms/), which would make sense since this hive is huge.\n\n>\"When honey bees are swarming, they are not nearly as defensive as they are around their hive because they are not protecting brood (developing young bees) or honey stores.\"\n Comment: The also had her hair done for it, and didn’t put it up. This is for the insta.\n Comment: There are bees without stinger.\n Comment: I've seen a ton of her videos, and she is super good at reading the behavior of the bees and is super gently and careful around them, once she finds the queen she puts them in a clip, moves it to the new home along with the combs she careful grabs and puts in frames, and just waits for them to move themselves at that point, she does mention she will use protective gear when absolutely needed\n Comment: A lot of beekeepers chose to work with no gear.\n\nPlus she knows that her biggest draw on social media is her attractiveness. So hiding that behind a beekeepers suit won't get her nearly the same response.\n Comment: I'm a beekeeper and your right. It's common to wear at least a veil, even amongst professionals. Also, all the stuff she has done to look the way she does gives me anxiety over the aromas. Bees are sensitive and if you go in with the wrong odor (alcohol, perfume, hairspray) you might get lit up. \n\nThere's other stuff wrong. We could nitpick it all day.  Beekeepers sure did when the bee movie came out as well. At the end of the day, this is my favorite little creature and it deserves all the publicity and not her.\n Comment: My sister was a first time bee keeper when she did this. She didn’t wear protective gear either. I feel like the bees can sense your fear and if you’re scared or nervous they will sting you. They kept stinging her friend instead who was wearing the protective net. It was crazy!!!!\n Comment: “But how else would I get views if I don’t look sexy while working?!”\n\nEdit: Did I trigger some IG influencers? :(\n Comment: Loved her in… [Bee Support](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EobNj9QwVSA)\n Comment: in a video she described iirc that protective gear can get overheating, and restrictive of vision- plus the gloves are less flexible than human hands\n Comment: It's hot as fuck in Texas\n Comment: main benefit in this video: Getting ppl to simp online.\n Comment: It was one of my favorite episodes in a long time for that one. She was gray.\n Comment: I'll yield to the expert that's done it thousands of times. She knows exactly what she's doing and what kind of bees she's dealing with.\n Comment: She is an expert with bad habits. Most bee keepers would approach a hive unprotected only if they were familiar with it. Even then using a veil at the minimum. She’s relying only on smoke to protect herself. And it sets a bad example of how to interact with a wild animal like bees. \n\nThen she’s wearing all dark clothes, long sleeves and pants, hair down. All not the most ideal from what I recall learning. Something about why beekeeper suits are always white. \n\nI’m not a beekeeper but my friends husband is. And I remember him talking about this lady.\n Comment: All these people just watched a woman relocate a hive bare-handed and have to display how much more about beekeeping they know.\n Comment: I was wondering the same, I think I can see one get squished in half in the video? I guess they're collateral damage\n Comment: That’s the point. She’s a beautiful woman who wants to show it off. \n\nDo you girl, do you.\n Comment:  Und es heißt....\n Comment: They sense her, but the smoke masks their alarm pheromones, so less chance of coordinated attack. Also many livestock bee species have been bred to be more docile and easy to handle. Someone in a full suit would likely have opened and checked the hive beforehand to check for an aggressive or \"hot\" hive. I can handle my bees similarly, and often touch them bare handed or briefly check out the hive from the outside with very little to no protective gear on, but as many other beekeepers have said here and elsewhere, having exposed arms, face, neck, wearing dark colors (as I've often seen her in, bees associate big dark shapes as predatory animals like bears) and especially hanging hair is just plain stupid and completely for Internet points.\n Comment: No one wants to hear this, but you're right.\n Comment: Proof..\n Comment: Dude chill. Do your research with some solid sources before you flip. \n\nYou act like a child.\n Comment: Found the tiktoker\n Comment: Why is this downvoted?\n Comment: It probably is.  There's definitely someone telling her what to do given the cuts in the vid.\n Comment: Simp detected\n\nOpinion rejected\n Comment: Y’all must be more into Aunts!\n Comment: And what's your source for this piece of \"enlightening\" information? 'Trust me, bro?'\n Comment: Actually, according to the article, that’s not what was found at all.

This guy should really take his own advice.\n Comment: When I first read the headline, I thought: \"Oh crap, don't tell me she's a MAGA nut.\" I was glad to read otherwise. Haters gonna hate. It just gets amplified on the net.\n Comment: It’s a crazy world we live in.\n Comment: Hmm.. sounds like something a Trumper would say! How much of your soul have you sold to your MAGA overlords?\n Comment: Do Joe and unbiased really belong in the same sentence anymore. When he started his podcast he was at least a little better - now his views are hardly unpredictable.\n Comment: They do bee like that\n Comment: Thank you. I know bees have specialized jobs, but I didn’t know how, or if, they are interchangeable. \n\nI’m guessing something something pheromones something bee dance something scientific? 😊\n Comment: When teaching ( and parenting too), the kids will absolutely regulate their fear to yours. You do not want 30 terrified screaming 11 year olds when you have a monster wasp on you!\n Comment: The smoke isn’t masking her scent at all, it masks the bees” own pheromones. She is currently a “threat” to the hive so multiple bees would have emitted alarm pheromones, which puts the others on alert and ready to attack. The smoke masks the pheromone scent, therefore reducing the alarm call and makes the whole process calmer and safer for the beekeeper. \n\nSmoke or not, she should be wearing at least a face veil. \n\nSource - am beekeeper.\n Comment: It's not the first time I've seen the smoker used but the person always had protective gear, a mesh mask and GLOVES at least. She came in with nothing didn't even protect her hair\n Comment: I honestly thought that the use of the smoke is to keep the bees away from you. Thanks for the information though. TIL\n Comment: That does not work on all honey bees. Dad had a few hives of a wild honey bee that you could have had the densest smoke possible and at least one of those buggers would pop you just for giggles. His hives with Italian and Midnight hybrids were much less aggressive and in particular the Midnight strain allowed him to open the hive without gowning up. But the wild honey bees, there was one in every hive whose sole role in life was to find a way under the veil and sting the person right between the eyes.\n Comment: But according to the Bee Movie, that smoker gives bees cancer or something\n Comment: Doesn't work on all hives. My father is a beekeeper. We'd still get stung without protection most of the time.\n Comment: I thought the smoke makes the bees think \"fire!\" And to return to the hive\n Comment: They can still sting you, hence why you should always wear protective gear ( my parents are beekeepers )\n Comment: Bees also gorge themselves on honey when smoke is detected. This makes them lazy and sleepy.\n Comment: Gives a new meaning to the phrase “smoke screen”…\n Comment: Nah, those are probably pure european bees, they're very docile, believe me if those were just a bit africanized smoke will not be enough, by personal experience.\n Comment: False.\n Comment: That's....not how it works.\n\nSource: was a beekeeper for years and went to many talks and lectures on beekeeping.\n Comment: That’s a great explanation of smoke for bees!  So often you just get “the smoke Cala them down” but makes a lot more sense this way.  No matter how “calm” they’d still get upset about their home being torn up.  But if they aren’t even aware she’s there?  They’d stay calm.\n Comment: Yes, but she used ot so little or probably most of the usage is outside of the video.\n\nJust the stereotypical bee keeper outfit playing it's part probably.\n\nThough yes what she is doing is rather awesome.\n Comment: That's partially how it works! There's an important survival mechanism kicking in, where they believe there is a fire. They are gorging on honey in preparation to swarm (evacuate) and search for a new home. Like you said, they are disinterested in protecting this home.\n\nOnce she has the queen, the bees follow her scent to their new hive. And you see the actual swarm.\n Comment: [removed]\n Comment: Good to know. Thanks\n Comment: It's a personal choice, let them bee themselves\n Comment: Well then she's just that good. That explains it.\n Comment: Just odd to see someone dealing with bees without the stereotypical white bee costume. But as others have kindly explained it's completely doable if the beekeeper knows what they are doing.\n Comment: That's rather impressive skill.\n Comment: She isn't.  Her husband does everything before and after the cameras come on, in full protective gear.  She just sits and looks pretty in front of the camera.  She misrepresents the difficulty of keeping happy healthy bees and laughs off the real concerns as \"coming from haters\".\n Comment: Experts that don't wear PPE don't go together. Commercial professionals do wear them.\n Comment: Once the first sting landed on the friend she became a beacon of pheromones for the other bees. Kinda like when running away from a bear but you have a slow friend.\n Comment: Checkmate for her then\n Comment: So what I'm hearing is that you think she's sexy? You can just say it, no need to be mean.\n Comment: thank you\n Comment: ha of course, didnt even consider that!!\n Comment: I sense Projection\n Comment: Why do these people see in such black in white..\n\nThere is an obvious benefit to not wearing the suit when you are an attractive woman, no shit. That doesn't have to mean he's suggesting she is artificial in any way.\n\nShe's just playing one of the cards she has been dealt. These people are pretending like she would have just as much of an online presence covered with a big suit.\n Comment: She's literally just a woman doing her job. What is wrong with you\n Comment: She must have been pretty sick\n Comment: Sure she can be an expert but she's taking a risk for looks. I, a former beekeeper,  happen to think that's stupid.\n Comment: Always trust a redditor to correct an expert.\n Comment: We hear that you're wrong lol \n\nGood try though\n Comment: Me? Oof so wrong.  I learned about her from my mother who is an amateur apiarist. Got a nice little email thread of how irresponsible this woman is, and from there she just keeps popping up everywhere. Articles, Facebook, reddit, casual conversation.  \n\nAnd no matter what you do, you hear people singing her praises when she doesn't deserve it. This isn't her work.   This isn't her care.  This isn't her passion.  Her passion is looking good for the cameras.\n Comment:  No….I meant too bad she’s a liberal clown, like the one who responded to my comment, and apparently one who worships a senile, pedophile who’s corrupt, weak, a complete embarrassment, can’t walk, talk, think on his own and has been a complete and utter disaster and taking this country down in flames.\n Comment: That robot voice? I hate it too.\n Comment: REhoMing. aN ENTire, BEEhIVE!\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: they get what they give\n Comment: Literally doesn't matter to me. If I'm trying to eat outside, they'll start coming by, possibly stinging me\n Comment: Just for us horney bees\n Comment: Sir, you’re having an allergic reaction.\n Comment: Gotta ask, is this person born male and this person was trying to be rude or did they just drop the s on accident?\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: I for one am very pleased that someone doing good work got some vindication after attacks against her went viral.\n Comment: And who cares if she was a trump supporter for some reason? She’s doing something more noble than most people on this planet regardless of political affiliation.\n\nPeople can be so much more than their politics.\n Comment: Ah, pre-emptive and baseless accusations, exactly like your \"4-D chess\" playing Orange Man! How long have you been a far-right MAGA fascist?\n Comment: Yes, no editing or gatekeeping. Just two people having a conversation. Just because you don’t agree with what he is saying, doesn’t mean that it isn’t unbiased. \n\nWould you rather get your information about Erika directly from Erika or through the eyes of a journalist at Vice News?\n Comment: The queen gives off specific pheromones that the hive knows and they will follow her for the most part\n Comment: While I agree with you on principle; counterpoint: BURN it with FIRE.\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Face veil = less Internet points\n Comment: Smoke also triggers bees to gorge on honey,  which then makes them less able to sting not only because they are busy gorging on honey, but because a honey bee with a belly full of honey just isn't able to sting very well.\n Comment: Don't tread on bee.    It's her choice to wear protective gear.   Leave her bee.\n Comment: I think Morgan freeman said he doesn’t really use protective gear either as they don’t really sting him\n Comment: My buddy was trying to get his bees out of a tree. They'd form a ball way up and he'd cut the branch and try to drop them into a box. So I was inside a giant cloud of bees that were being dropped out of a tree over and over. It was bee pandemonium and they were frantic and noisy as hell but there were no stings and none were landing on me even. My buddy finally got the queen in the box and you could feel the mood sort of change. The swarm thinned and got quiet but when I was near the box they started landing on me. I moved further away from the box.\n\nI think they're predictable if you work with them regularly.\n Comment: Iirc she explains in another video. Basically you can tell by the behavior of the bees right away if you need gear or not. I guess some bees are just chill about you messing with them\n Comment: she knows her job\n Comment: My grandpa never used gloves but usually (not always) used protective shirt and mask. I knew another old man that never used any protective gear, just washed himself before going to bees and moved carefully.\n Comment: When the males live for like 30 days max, I'm not sure cell mutations would do much. \n\nShame on that kids movie /s\n Comment: It's a terrible explanation of smoke for bees. It doesn't mask her scent and make them not know she's there.\n Comment: >She's doing God's work, she is really awesome.\n\nWhat's with the cloned comment?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/12rkggv/comment/jgv22n8/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3\n Comment: How is this gods work? What were god supposed to do here that he/she didn’t do so that a human had to take action and do the work god failed to do?\n Comment: Listening to you drone on and on is making me break out in hives.\n Comment: The next time you see some bees or wasps, take a moment to stand still and watch them. When they are calm, they will move more slowly. When they are cranky, they are kind of twitchy. With wasps, theirs heads may be raised, and their antennas likely moving rapidly. It can be very useful if you ever need to spray a wasp nest. Don't do it when they are already in a bad mood.\n Comment: Sauce? I’ve watched many of her videos where she is scooping bees and handling honeycomb. She’s hardly sitting there and looking pretty in this video. What is the husband doing that she isn’t?\n Comment: If I could make ppl simp I probably would. But let's not me naive.

I'm more talking bout the assholes that go after em n their hives when they aren't doin anything\n Comment: they probably won't sting you. It's okay to be scared, fear is irrational afterall. But wasps really don't care unless you disturb thier nest\n Comment: I like her boo-bees\n Comment: Was about to say this 😂😂\n Comment: I would submit that media coverage is partly to blame for these kinds social media attacks going viral in the first place.  Reporting on this kind of drama incentivizes trolls with more attention, elevating and extending the reach of their toxic behavior outside of social media bubbles. Even stories like this one, which is critical of bad-faith actors and trolls, I would say do more harm than good.  Also, we shouldn't be rewarding journalists for scrolling their Twitter feed for content instead of doing actual reporting.\n\nEdit: I edited a bunch of times.\n Comment: 🤣\n Comment: I deff heard her mention she uses the protective gear to start with and if colony isn't threatening she takes it off and does the vid\n Comment: Not in Iran.\n Comment: This is one of those harmless internet facts that I’m not going to research because it’s way funnier to just bee-lieve you\n Comment: But he is Morgan Freeman\n Comment: The legend is, that Morgan Freeman doesn’t use smoke, but calms the bees with his soothing voice.\n Comment: They don’t sting him out of respect, though\n Comment: That’s a swarm and they don’t have food or brood to protect so they don’t get as aggressive, they mainly just want to follow their mom and find a new home\n Comment: [deleted]\n Comment: Linemen know their job, construction workers know their job, PPE is a thing for a reason. This lady is good looking and is obviously talented but she’s sure taking big risks just for some likes.\n Comment: That’s what I get for believing the internet. :(\n Comment: That's cute, honney\n Comment: If you need to spray a wasp/hornet nest, do it at dusk.   They have very poor night vision and will be mostly all inside their hive, and more reluctant to come out.    This means you’ll get them all and they won’t be as able to defend themselves (aka sting the fuck out of you)\n Comment: “Dressed up” “hair done” these are things *every* person regardless of gender should be doing before leaving the house lol. The projection is really showing but there’s always room for growth!\n Comment: Depends on how many bees you are coming in contact with\n Comment: Honestly they are just upset they aren't the ones in rhe spotlight\n Comment: Experts don't always agree with eachother. Doesn't mean either is right or wrong. There are lots of different ways to do the same task\n\n>actual experts\n\nExclaimed the redditor with no bee keeping experience\n Comment: It was proven false by a vice article (see linked article at the top). Just a bunch of butt hurt people jealous this lady has both looks and talant. \n\nTbh, I dont trust anyone on reddit who calls themselves \"an expert\" unless they use peer reviewed articles to back their shi up.\n Comment: Well if the hive is near my house or yard, they're probably going to try to hurt me at some point. So I'll definitely murder them\n Comment: If you mean a fear of wasps specifically, then perhaps it’s a little irrational. But fear as a response to danger is definitely not irrational, it’s a survival mechanism.\n Comment: I don't know that. When there's a dozen or so flying around me when I'm trying to peacefully eat a picnic, I'm going to assume they're going to sting me\n Comment: Oh honey... bee-have!\n Comment: Disgusting comment, take my upvote.\n Comment: Ha ha, you shouldn’t because it’s a somewhat dubious claim.  However I did read it in an actual beekeeping book, so it at least seems more “truthy” than reading it online.   I bee-lieve the source is the Beekeeper’s Handbook.\n Comment: This is true\n Comment: You don’t fuck with God… \n\n/s\n Comment: Can't argue with this logic.\n Comment: But he is Morgan Blackhand\n Comment: Sure are judgemental aren’t you. Any time any good looking girl does anything on camera there’s always that Redditor thinking they do it only for the likes.\n Comment: These puns are awful. You guys should write for buzzfeed.\n Comment: Bro she is beekeeping. How often you see normal beekeepers like this?\n Comment: That could be it, I never really looked past the head lines. Just thought it was worth noting.\n Comment: 🤷 idk what more you want from people my dude. I never claimed to have experience. I was just saying I saw other bee keepers / exterminators chime in on her once and most weren’t in favor of her or how she goes about things.\n Comment: You missed the part where not all wasps are agro. But it’s your property kill away.\n Comment: Wasps are less dangerous than cars\n Comment:  I once caught a wasp with my bare hand and put it in a Tupperware container, then carried it around all day and then let it out and it just flew away. Didn't get stung. They literally don't care about anything aside from food and thier nest. \n\nmaybe wasps are just pushovers where I live, who knows.\n Comment: Ohk honey... I wonder what her hobees are..\n Comment: It hurt to send. Worth, I guess\n Comment: Facts are facts\n Comment: She’s literally doing it for likes. Put this video next to a video of a dude in a bee suit doing the same thing and see who gets more likes. \nShe literally did her hair before showing up instead of taking even the slightest caution and tying it back. Motherfuckers are delusional\n Comment: You aren’t judgmental?\n Comment: Was trying my best here\n Comment: That’s what I put in my Bumble profile.\n Comment: Ah I forgot your supposed to get out of bed and just not apply yourself. Dude, attractive people can have jobs. What’s she supposed to do? Just look a mess? Again dude, it’s not that serious to be this objective..especially when the person is literally trying to help the planet.\n Comment: How would I know which type they are before they get within stinging range?\n Comment: Awesome\n\nI'm mad they are trying to get my food, scared they might sting me, and I would much rather kill them or run away than do any other option\n Comment: Probably drones on about bees.\n Comment: Honey laundering\n Comment: Good luck with the IPO asshat!\n Comment: Really none of our beesness\n Comment: Yeah, but how would I identify which one it is before they get into stinging range\n\nNot sure I could identify a wasp from 10 or 15 feet away\n Comment: Mind your own beeswax.",
